"Hi, I see some documentation of using Torus with JavaScript, is there any for Java? We needed seamless login for Android."
There isn't native support at this point in time
Any workarounds?
"if you're able to use a webview in your Android app you might be able to wrap it with some proxied calls to the JS sdk. our wallet is also installable as a PWA so it might be possible to send calls over to the PWA wallet. however, we dont have support for this right now"
"Ah :( 
None for iOS either?"
"There is a way I'm speculating using Rhino, it's an Android Library to call JS methods without webview. Too bad I'm not an Android dev :(
I'll definitely open an issue. :)"
thanks!
"Also, HOW IS TORUS NOT MORE POPULAR?"
your kind words make our day! we generally dont do that much marketing
This is helping us SO much Leonard you have no clue
"Hey, I'm trying to test the frontend of my app against a local ganache blockchain that is a fork of the mainnet. I've tried initializing torus with a networkName of "",  , ', a chainId of 999 (this is set when starting ganache), and a host of either ',  , ' or ',  , "". But I'm getting some errors in the console"""
"Any idea what the cause of this is and how to resolve it? I'm a big fan of developing/testing against mainnet forks since it makes things so much easier, so I'd love to get this working!"
Ganache has to be on https for it to work
Ah gotcha. Do you know how to specify this when starting ganache? I'm not sure how to do that and don't see a flag for it
"We need ganache to be on https since our wallet is on https, and modern browsers don't allow mixed http/https content"
"Awesome, will give that a shot. Thanks to both of you for the help!"
And now I just saw the corresponding docs section for this. Whoops ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Got it thx
Hi all
hi adam
Hi Zhen :)
Nice to meet you
"I'm looking to use torus in a react-native app, can you say what is the simplest way to do so?"
"Native support isn't available yet, but if you embed torus into a webview it should work"
"with regards to the iframe displays on the page itself definitely, on initialization you can disable the torusButton"
but the UI in the popups are necessary for user consent
"its possible to do a while label on the whole thing though, if youre thinking about using us for commrecial reasons"
"Whitelable is an option, we don't care so much, we mostly want to start building. It can be a solution until you finish the react-native package."
hey all im interested in prototyping some stuff on torus on gitcoin.  is there an API that doesnt require NPM?  our stack is python/django/web3js on frontend
i see the embed; but most of the docs are focused on the NPM ecosystem.. (not webified)  is there a way to take the users on gitcoin (who have been OAuth‚Äôd into github) and give them torus private key?
"Presently, the users will need to authenticate or authroize with any of the existing providers available on torus. But login in with github is very much viable and is in the pipeline"
Hi all. I've enabled cookies on safari iOS but still seem to be getting thsi message
Ok will look forward to that
indeed we were missing a step
"i guess from a user's perspective though ,is there anything that can be done to make it easier?"
also we have noticed on mobile the experience is a little clunky. is there any plan to move away from popups
"it makes it feel like a redirect whereas competitors like bitski, fortmatic, etc are all non pop-up modals which is way better on mobile"
"We are coming up with a permissions framework by mid Feb which would greatly reduce the need for tx, sign confirmation popups.!"
thank you but not exactly my question
"if the dapp has no permission framework, there would still be popups yes?"
also the need for 3rd party cookies - why is this necessary?
does everyone have to go through that process to get it to work?
Iframes can't have access to sessionStorage if 3rd party cookies are blocked. We use sessionStorage to enable rehydration
"When you use torus, we inject an iframe of torus-website which handles all your rpc calls"
"rehydration means that if you login once and reload the page, you don't need to login again"
is safari the only browser with this issue?
Brave with privacy shield enabled
"Using popups as the mechanism is more secure. Traditionally, In-page modals are vulnerable to clickjacking"
"i see. and what about popups? I see that both chrome mobile and firefox mobile on samsung ask me to ""allow popups"" for the site"
"If so, which version of Torus are you using?"
we are using 0.2.12
"The way we do it is...
We try to open a popup, if it's blocked, we show a modal which on click opens the popup without any problem"
Browser blocks popups if the call stack is too deep or too long has passed since user interaction
"so for safari, should we effectively just disable it?"
"Hence, we show that modal if we detect that a popup has been blocked. You don't need to unblock anything."
Let me get back to you on that.
I've just used Torus on iOS with default settings as in the screenshot and it seems to work fine.
Please check if you're using private browsing.!
I've tested this and iOS Safari works just fine with the default settings
Ok thanks I'll check again
I'm sorry what do you mean by that.?
"yes, they have to reauthenticate, the session isn't persisted once the user closes the tab, generally this is still pretty fast since oauth logins are usually one-click"
Ok so the idea is the user should click login pretty much everytime they visit the dapp
"Is ""remember me"" functionality possible where the user doesnt have to click?"
"it is definitely possible but keeping the user logged in for just that session gives better privacy guarantees

part of the problem is that our SDK is implemented by dapps and they aren't really obligated to ""logout"" the user at any time if we persist sessions

most oauth providers already solve this problem by auto-approving the login if the user logged in recently, so it's literally a single click. the dapp can also trigger the login process themselves if they wish"
always happy to change our mind if this is what developers and users are looking for :)
Hi guys..
I have a doubt..
Does Torus supported in angular 8..?
Yes it is
"Hi guys, the new version of torus website is live, at v0.2.14,\nyou can view the changes - ',  , '\n\n',  , '\nPlease test and report any issues found on GitHub\n\nPlease remember that it may take up to 24 hours for you depending on isp and location to view the website\n\nIf you want immediate access, please navigate to ',  , ' directly'"
"Hey again. I'm getting an "",  , ' error when getting the public address for Twitch and Facebook logins (Google, Reddit, and Discord work though).\n\nAfter calling ',  , ' and authenticating, I then call ',  , ' followed by ',  );'}, "". I've tried versions 0.2.12 and 0.2.14 and get the same error"""
"The name resolver only supports google, reddit and discord verifiers as of now."
"Well, for Facebook and twitch, the unique id is not a publicly known email or id.! It's internal to those platforms and available through the oauth login.
That's why we can't create these accounts ahead of time unless we know these unique IDs.
So, we disabled name resolver for these logins.!"
"Could you expand on that a bit more? Specifically the question I have now is that since the Facebook login email address (or Twitch username) is unique, why couldn't that be used as the unique ID?"
You can change both your Facebook email and twitch username
We can't use them as unique identifiers
"Ahhh ok that makes perfect sense. I thought the docs might have been outdated, but now I understand. Thanks!"
Glad we could be of help
"Here unable to import Torus in Angular 8 üòí, do you know, what is the actual process to import it."
Pls check your node modules again !! Try reinstall
"Hey guys, our Dapp is using Torus via web3connect. Recently Torus gets stuck after authotization with Google"
And all requests to Torus are timed out
Can you send logs the network logs ?
Which version of Torus are you using.?
"version of torus-embed ""0.2.11"""
Pls update to 1.0.0
mmm I see..
It has no breaking changes in terms of the api
Just update the packages and you're good to go
mm I'm using it via web3connect
but let's try
"In our last release, we deprecated v0.2.11 and lower"
This was in our release notice and npm warning
"0.2.14"" is broken too, right?"
"No, it isn't"
"yeah cool, 0.2.14 seems to work üôÇ"
needed to updated web3connect to latest
Glad to be of help
Pls let us know when you release a new version of your dapp.
"np, I think we'll do this today üôÇ"
"Q: ',  , ' when user is creating a new account on ',  , '  Wallet Options does not list TORUS wallet (',  , ')\nsame issue with ',  , ' in that TORUS wallet is not presented as an option to connect with'"
Good to hear - it will be most welcome having torus integrated with both
you can connect with Torus üôÇ
It works great
Thanks for the update
"hi matt, taking a look"
"Thanks Zhen, should also let you know we're using v1.0.0"
Are there any workarounds for this in the meantime? I‚Äôll be talking with a few mobile users Friday and would love to be able to demo this on mobile then
I think v0.2.12 doesn't have this issue
"Good to know, will give a try later today"
Still having the issues with 0.2.12 unfortunately üòï
"Looks like there's another v1.0.0 issue with the Google OAuth login, as it now just shows ""401. That‚Äôs an error. Error: deleted_client. The OAuth client was deleted."" The others seem to be working as expected"
Ah good to know. Any estimate on when it should be completed?
"Within 12 hours, will notify you as soon as it's up"
"Yeah agreed, that could be improved. Will definitely do"
"Awesome, much appreciated!"
we are done with the upgrade and all services are back to normal
Thanks for your patience
"To confirm, this version does not include the mobile fix right? Quick test on mobile Safari over localhost and it seems to still get stuck at the loding page"
Hi . It does include the fix. Can we get on a call to resolve this.?
"no, there wont be an account resolver for that"
"since the private key is no longer based on just the Google email, but also based on the user's password, it's not possible to generate accounts for users ahead of time"
"we are planning to have a lookup for email/phone number logins that have already been created, but that's slightly less useful than the current account resolvers for OAuth"
"to answer the other question, also no, the OAuth logins and the email/phone logins are separate Ethereum addresses"
"So how exactly does the current resolver work compared to the email/phone one? 

I tried sending funds to a non-existant gmail address, created that account, logged in via Google on Torus, and the funds were there. Pretty amazing that this works, though I don't understand why that is possible for OAuth and not regular email, since in both cases all that initially existed was the email address"
"For email address/password logins an the user password is used as an additional salt on top of the key that's distributed on the network. This has the advantage of having user input contribute to the security of the key, but has the disadvantage of not being able to assign keys to users ahead of time"
"It is theoretically possible to allow the user to have two accounts on the email/password, one with the salt and one without - but we're trying to get the intuitive flows down right before we do so"
From the user perspective
"Does this imply that email/password keys are more secure than OAuth, since (it seems) OAuth logins only rely on the email address, whereas email/password has the added salt?"
"mmmm one can see it that way, yeap"
but of course you have the UX downsides of no resolver ahead of time
and having to implement recovery schemes
"Yea, I‚Äôm curious to see how the account recovery process will work when the key is password-dependent. Similar question for changing password"
"For what it‚Äôs worth, we‚Äôre finding that having the resolver available ahead of time (before the initial login) is super useful for onboarding new users"
we definitely agree with you
theres a simple flow we're in the midst of implementing. having the user key  = seed + public-nonce + H(user-salt) - then setting up recovery via gmail or other logins (lol) or security questions as the user-salt with a different public-nonce. we'll have a full writeup when its released
"Awesome, looking forward to reading it! üôÇ"
"if you wish to debug, we can get on a call."
and here it is with web3connect
yes it is.!
Getting this strage error on torus@1.1.1 on chrome. Anyone seen this before ?
do you have a hosted example you could link so we could take a look?
DMing yu link to hosted codesandbox
Is there an update on the torus direct integration
or Zhen :))
Thanks
what is Torus?
its a cryptocurrency wallet
ezpz to use
do you have a option to process fiat payments
"Well, you can buy crypto using credit card in our wallet, if that's what you mean"
which provider do you use ?
check it out\
its all there
thanks
if you are interested to use the api of Indacoin too...just let me know
Are you interested to add the api of Indacoin to process credit cards payments?
It supports 12 fiat options
We support more than 180 countries
Hello all üëã
"I am having some truble integrating Torus, is this the place to ask for help ?"
yes please let us know the issue
"Cool thanks, I am getting ""share decryption Error: Bad MAC"" after the private key is generated and than it loads forever"
on rinkeby in testing mode
can you provide more details about your setup.?
"are you using torus-embed.? if so, which version.?"
Yeah shall we move to DM not to spam everyone?
"I am wondering when one would use 'Torus Wallet Integration', and when one would use 'DirectAuth Integration'?"
Hi James!
Thanks for the interest
this illustrates it quite well
if your application wants an external prebuilt UI interface + fiat onramps and is web based the torus wallet is a great integration to go for
if you want to build your own permissions flow and have cross platform/blockchain support directAuth is great!
Ok thanks for your response
"Is Torus free, and will it remain so?"
"Also, will it be possible to Torus with xdaichain?"
yes.. it's possible to use torus with xdai chain
"yes, it will always have a free tier, but there are rate limits for the free tier"
Is that documented somewhere?
Do you have any indication of what those limits will be?
"tbh we want to support as many people as we can on the free tier but its really subject to server loads and costs, no definite answer but you can be sure that our free tier will still remain usable for everyone"
"Hey team, CDN doesnt seem to be working for me anymore, perhaps there is a way to test this or I may be missing something else."
What package are you using?
"Got the CDN script in, then trying to run window.Torus and then any window.Torus functions like window.Torus.showWallet()"
"thank you that worked, looks like some old code broke for me"
web3.eth.accounts0
"Still trying to get it working with xdai - I tried passing 'xdai' in as a host, it's not working, I get error in the console, so I'm guessing this is not the right way to do this?"
You should pass in the jrpc endpoint for xDai
"torus-app key in sessions storage, does appear like"
so I guess it's a just an issue with the wallet?
"Hmm.. pls pass along a name while initialization. Also, which version are you using?"
Yes. Please also use the latest v1.4.3 we fixed that name issue in 1.4.0 I think.!
"ok great thanks, I don't know how I didn't install the latest version, perhaps a copy and paste..."
"Hi, direct auth is different from normal torus-embed"
"I am aware of that. I have created a new project for direct-auth and I am trying to get it working. Can you please clarify if I need a test net, and what the proxyContractAddress is?"
"Great, thank you!"
"with the embed widget, is it possible to call torus.showWallet('transfer') and pre-populate the 'Transfer to' address?"
"As of now, it's not. I'll add support to it in the coming release"
"That would be great, thanks"
"I deployed the widget in a Gatsby project, and although I can run it in developer mode ok, when I build for deployment, I get this error"
I'm wondering if this is something to do with server-side rendering?
"in general are the the iframe and direct-auth built for single page apps? 

I ask because although I  implementing direct-auth with a react SPA because of the Service worker requirement, and I don't think that works well with Gatsby for example..."
All of these products are meant for browser primarily
"On my other project, I am also still trying to get direct auth working. I am currently getting this error"
"I want to change the redirect url to match what I have in my Google OAuth App http://localhost:3000/service-worker.js?redirect=true, but I can't figure out where or how this url is built and sent. Can someone help please.... I'm investigating these 2 approaches for Giveth, and it's a bit frustrating. Any help would be appreciated."
"hey James, sorry to hear you're running into issues, I'll take a look at the repo to see what problems you're running into"
"Regarding direct auth, \nSame as torus-embed, this is also a client side package.\nplease refer to this example\n',  , '\nA bit more context:\nThat example has ',  , ' as the redirect uri registered with google\nbaseUrl passed into torus sdk is ',  , ""You're supposed to serve sw.js from "",  , ' and ',  , "" as fallback for browsers that don't support service workers from "",  "
Please let us know if you have any more questions. we'll be glad to answer. We can schedule a call if needed to sort these issues
Hiya! Can I get a test-net spun up to play with today?
Give me your Google client id
PM me!
"Hi,
Can I run a torus node on my server? If yes then can anyone share the installation process for the same."
I am already using DirectAuth
"I also wanted to confirm what data does smart contract holds, does it holds nodes list?"
Skizzle (Newfang)
it mainly does node discovery yes
holds the node list
hey guys
I don't undertand if it's possible to see erc20 tokens on torus wallet
I can't manage to do it
It‚Äôs possible. Which tokens aren‚Äôt displayed for you?
"Hi all, gitbooks our docs host is facing issues with ddos in certain regions"
"Hello Team, great work on this project!

Can i please have one of the Admins send me a message?  I am interested in this platform and also i have a promotional offer that can take this project to the next level and bring in thousands of big investors. Thanks"
"hello guys, does Torus give a way to sign a transaction?"
"So I have the basic direct auth working:
const userInfo = await torus.triggerLogin('google', 'ma-verifier')"
beautiful!
Is its purpose only for authentication?
Is the idea to use torus-embed alongside it side by side? To get web 3 functionality?
Is it OK if I use Torus for my Distributed Identity application everyone?
"yes,, you can wrap torus provider with web3 and sign transaction that way"
"direct auth and torus-embed are different products.!
With torus-embed you get the entire wallet functionality with permissions, confirmations etc.
With direct auth, you get the app scoped private key so that you can build your own UX"
yes.. of course.. pls reach out if you need any help with the integration
"our team is integrating Torus, Uport to my project."
"With direct auth, you get the app scoped private key so that you can build your own UX => you mean wit direct auth, my app can retrieve the private key ? (sorry my bad english)"
Yes. You will get the private key.
what's the method please?
"const torusKey = await this.getTorusKey(verifier, userInfo.verifierId,  , idToken || accessToken);"
unsure if that method returns public key + private key for the user
That method handles communication with torus nodes to retrieve the key
thanks I finally managed to do it :)
"hi, what is the right way to config the google client id, it get this error: ""Error: Unable to resolve enough promises, responses: {""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""error"":{""code"":-32602,""message"":""Internal error"",""data"":""Error occurred while verifying paramsazip is not clientID 366106252773-1kiihfd..."""

please do!
"Pretty sure my direct auth was working before, now I'm getting this error:"
anyone seen this before?
Yes. Looks like your requests to Torus nodes timed out.! We use a 12 sec timeout
We'll check internally about the cause
"Thanks Team for your support. One question: do we have a detailed tutorial on how to integrate Direct Auth? For example: how to configure on Google site, Facebook developer site..."
we will be improving the documentation and putting more links etc. soon
"yes.. \nFor Google,  follow instructions: ',  , ' and use the obtained client id while initiating direct sdk\nFor facebook, follow instructions: ',  , '\nFor reddit, follow instructions: ',  "
"Thanks Google Login worked for me, but I'm getting stuck with the others üôÅ"
I'll add this comment to the documentation for links on how to create accounts for different providers
"Is DirectAuth working for you? (Google login, FB login)?"
"looks like infura is rate limiting our testnet nodes

we're updating the testnet now!
ok thank you
"We resolved all the issues with the infura rate limiting.
The testnet should be working as normal for direct auth"
hmm.. ok. we'll get back to you on this.! Thanks for your patience.
thank you Chaitanya
Torus has issue again
"recently updated the testnet for development reasons, apologies for the inconvenince. We'll be pinging this group ahead of time for changes on the testnet in the future"
ok thanks Zhen
Has the auth0 authentication stopped working. I just get this error
did you change the URL in init params?
"you can try things like Weibo login and Github login there, if that's working its more likely to be a configuration issue"
It was because the domain in jwtParams didn't have https:// at the start. It used to work without so must of changed in an update
its in the torus-direct-web-sdk example folder
"support for this is limited, since we have tried to avoid bundling a UI with the DirectAuth SDK, you will probably need to write some SMS code flow on your own"
is it not possible to make it work using the same way as email and password authentication using universal login?
"For passwordless email you click a link from your email which opens in a browser, auth0 supports that flow if it opens in the same browser"
"For SMS usually people get a code for passwordless logins, but since we dont have a UI youll need to pass the code along to the auth0 endpoint to get it verified"
If youre using links for SMS and the link opens in the same browser it should work exactly the same as passwordless email
"For Google, Facebook, Twitch account, it's working but for Reddit it's say bad request. Is anything different from Reddit to other account types?"
I'm not sure if the FkXHth... is client id of Reddit?
you must use the type of installed app for reddit as we use implicit login flow
yeah thank you
Does the iframe require metamask to be installed or the web3 provider?
iframe doesn‚Äôt require meta mask to be installed.
"What about custom OAuth providers, if I have my own OAuth server?"
We do support it with auth0 provider
"Ok, but adding other providers OAuth providers isn't trivial?"
"depends, generally its pretty easy to add a new OAuth provider if it follows the idtoken/JWK spec, since we have a generic way of handling this. If you're adding it via Auth0 it's already immediately possible - we support all the OAuth providers that Auth0 supports, but keep in mind that this means you are delegating the verification of the user to Auth0 as an intermediary. 

adding other custom OAuth providers beyond these is generally not that straightforward. some of the OAuth providers also use something called the ""authorization code flow"" which always requires the dapp developer to run a verification server (which breaks our security assumptions, since the dapp developer can mitm the idtoken - all our token flows are front-end only, which is why our SDK doesnt require you to run any kind of hosted backend). but in some cases its still possible. TLDR - its complicated, but generally non-trivial if the OAuth provider doesnt directly support the idtoken flow, or if you arent using Auth0 as the intermediary for managing your OAuth logins"
which allows you to spin up an OAuth server quickly
"yes, we are looking into supporting more companies similar to what you've described, exploring Okta and Firebase atm, which can be good replacements for Auth0"
have you used them before? how would you rate the dev experience compared to something like Auth0?
"I haven't used them before. I'm interested in them because they have a solid open source version of the their server, and so I would choose them in order to get familiar with their server"
"It sounds like your implementation makes it hard to use an open source OAuth server, due to man in the middle vulnerability, as you outline..."
"I would like it so that anyone registered with an email and password on my website could get a wallet, I was wondering if I could somehow do that by setting up my own OAuth server.... that would be pretty amazing! Not going to happen soon though?"
Any idea what could cause this?
"on the contrary, you already can!

if you have an open source OAuth server that supports the idtoken JWK format, we already support that out of the box. All of our Auth0-based logins are using JWK endpoints for verification of the OAuth idtoken (which is a JWT). If you have the JWK endpoint that you want to use, we can create a test app on the testnet smart contract with that JWK endpoint and you should be able to start using that.

of course, this does mean that the open source OAuth server is in charge of access to user wallets (which is non-ideal) but there are other solutions to that, such as storing additional private key derivation information on the user's device."
"I have a problem with torus on safari ios. When click on Google button, nothing happens"
"just says on the console ""Service worker has been registered"" and Verifier:  ‚Äì ""google-mickey"". no google login popup appear like on Safari/MacOSx or Android"
no popup?
are popups blocked
looks like popup is being blocked
yes it's working now
thanks
"In the case, I think user should have only 1 ETH account since the user logged in by 1 email, even Googe or others"
"we definitely understand it can be a UX hole, but the logins are implemented in this way for (for the torus wallet) security reasons"
basically if you peg a key for logins defined via an individuals email you make the security of the key to the weakest login
there are ways to work around this and join logins though and it can be done for DirectAuth. we've done this for google and generic emails a few times now!
an alternative to joining it on the torus network is combining logins on the smart contract layer
having 1 smart contract per user and combining the keys from the different logins to that contract
it looks like  aparams issue in the initalization of the SDK
what are your initlization params and SDK version
"the issue only happens on Safari - iphone, so I don't think the aparams are wrong"
"it only happens when I login Facebook/Google but intead of typing email/password, I go back and select another provider"
"then it does nothing, can't navigate to the provider page"
I can reproduce this issue 100% on my iphone-safari
"to make it works again, I have to clear cache"
hmm i see
lol nice fonts
must be something with whats cached in the sdk
give us a bit to replicate and explore
"ohh we can't login anymore with Safari-iphone, even clear cache or do whatever"
Do you have a demo site ? Which version of the sdk are you using.?
Clear cache > log in with Google > type username/password > loading forever
can't go back to our site
"Can you host this on heroku or some other demo site, so that we can debug it too.?
Also, pls update to the latest version"
that's the demo site
I am unable to open google
That might be because of popup being blocked right.!
"yes, you should allow opening popup first"
"Ideally, you should split the initialization and login code"
do you have a sample code on Github that our team will take a look for reference?
"that's great, thanks"
I opened the link in safari and clicked on google. Instead of typing email and password I went back to your website and clicked on Facebook. The new Facebook pop up did open
Am I missing something ?
did you get some error messages from Torus?
I guess we need to do several times before the issue happens
No I didn‚Äôt.
"If you could send me a video / more information, that‚Äôd be helpful"
"I can't manage to login Google now, it shows the loading forever on Google page"
Can you send me a screenshot
Can Change tabs and go to your app
Let‚Äôs take this conversation off the group. I‚Äôll ping you

which one
"Is there any kind of authentication flow that you can imagine to allow me to combine telegram, oauth and torus?"
"interesting that you ask this, because we have explored this previously

Short answer: No, not right now.

Long answer:

Telegram has a non-standard login that works pretty much as follows:
1. Create a bot and get a secret key
2. User logs in using a Telegram custom widget, which generates some hashed data
3. Match hashed data against secret key

This process means that the dapp developer can falsify authentication credentials (by generating their own hash), which means the dapp developer can access the user's account

This is generally Not Good, but if you add in other factors like using a multi-sig smart contract wallet, or perhaps some kind of threshold signature functionality, it can still be useful to use Telegram login here as some kind of authenticated credential. We are working on a threshold signature solution that mitigates this.

The only way this will work based on current limitations is if Telegram changes their API, or if a 3rd party authenticator (eg. Auth0, Okta), is willing to provide Telegram logins."
Do you need to set up a separate verifier for auth0 hosted passwordless sms? I'm getting errors after the sms verification completes.
with the prior one being used for email?
yes you do need a different one
generally you need a different verifier for each new login type
Yes I think the prior must of been email
Can I set one up for hosted passwordless sms?
pm me your client_id and other details
By default Torus only shows the tokens present in eth-contract-metadata. Pls click on the refresh button at the bottom of the screen to show additional tokens that you may have
"Morning, folks. Can we get Torus object after refreshing browser tab?"
"Hi, I am trying to integrate torus-direct-web-sdk but I am currently getting this error. What I am trying to do is simply to just authenticate through facebook. Can anyone help me with this?"
Your token is invalid
Probably misconfigured clientId
Isn't the client id the app id of the facebook app that I've created?
"Yes, it is"
Is your verifier deployed.?
No. How can I do that?
Right! Thank you!
Now I am able to login. It looks like the outage is happening between 11 pm and 1 am UTC. Same window was yesterday.
Next time this occurs would it be possible to check out the network tab
We need a bit more information on where the failure is occurring
will do!
Also where are you based?
Toronto
Thanks!
No problem!
We‚Äôd like to make it happen
"Pretty bandwidth constrained, so want to be efficient"
Same error as yeasterday and day before yesterday at the same time:
"Hi everyone, due to an increase in usage, we are hitting some rate limits on our service providers. We are working with our service providers to increase these rate limits, so do expect some service disruption while this is being rectified."
"hey Elena, yes, we have found the root cause, Infura is rate limiting us"
"in particular, some of the nodes are being rate limited by Infura whereas some other ones are fine, that's why the problem is intermittent. Also, we arent exceeding burst limits, but daily request limits.  Which is why the error keeps happening around this time, because Infura resets the daily rate limits at the same time every day."
Is there any walk around it?
"Not right now no, we are working on contacting our node operators and having them rate limit outgoing traffic so we dont hit infura's rate limits"
Got it. Thank you!
It should be working now since Infura has reset their rate limits (seems like they reset it at 12AM GMT every day) but we are still working on a fix to rate limit outgoing Infura requests.
"Yes, it's working now. Thank you!"
"Hello, looks like it takes 3 round trips to get node details from the smart contracts which is about ~2s for me on testnet. Is there any way to speed this up?"
yes you can pass your own ethereum RPC provider
"we use a rate limited one, but if you pass your own RPC provider into the constructor of directAuth sdk, it should use that connection instead to fetch smart contract information"
Ah cool. So I could cache that info and update when I detect changes on the smart contract
let me confirm that with our front end team
"Got it, thanks!"
Our torus implementations works fine locally but not working online in Aws ec2
Is there any specific steps we have to do while going live after testing locally ?
Can you provide more details about which torus product you're using and the error you're facing?
This has been resolved
It a dex . I can on you
"sure thing, you're exactly right we need to deploy the verifier, PMed you"
created your verifier ^
on testnet
Should I run on ropsten?
as in your app can be mainnet
but in the directAuth SDK use the testnet details
we can shift to mainnet when youre ready
Are different keys created if the verifier ID is different?
Is there any option I can integrate torus wallet in the node environment? (for react-native)
Not at the moment
Thanks
"Hi, hope this is the right place to ask this, suppose a user accidentally discloses their private key (available in Settings in the wallet), can they reset their private key to a new one? (and get a new address of course)

If not, perhaps this would be a useful feature to implement.

(This is a hypothetical question, it hasn't happened to me or anyone I know).
Also, this is such an awesome project, thank you to all who have contributed!"
"thanks for the request daniel, this is actually possible on the backend, but would require changes on the front-end. all we need to do is assign you another key on the torus network and use that key instead.

we'll put the feature in the pipeline"
PMed you
"hi, i cant send my knc from wallet . it says ty later ?"
Do you have enough eth to pay the gas fee.?
in knc yes . no eth
it deducts the gas fron knc . right ?
It doesn't deduct gas from knc
You'll need eth to pay the gas fee separately.!
so i tried swap some knc to eth . but it says i dont have eth ...
stupid that
broken - needs fix
one could imagine a gas pool separate so this wouldent happen . ever again
separate gas pool wallet
that could connect to any gas crazed blocking app
so i would like to be able connect a gas wallet to your app for only gas . that way one could also account for the gas one uses
gas users need a gas wallet to keep tabs on gas
i have knc that could be transfered to eth but now it is locked . its stupid ... just deduct fron knc to eth gas !
thats why a separate gas wallet is not a bad idee
but i shouldent be needed becouse it could deduct gas into eth from anything really
your service could have a separate pool that fixex that crap
take some of whatever and put in pool exchanged for gas
hahaha
you can top me up with some fre gas ...
from my knc per auto
is needed
The ability to send funds to a user just by using their social media username on the Torus app is really cool! I was wondering how does it work though? Are you able to generate the ETH address just from the username?
"Does that mean that the key is generated on the users behalf before they have even used the Torus wallet? What happens if for example a user changes their name on Twitter, would they no longer be able to claim the funds that were sent to them?

Also is it possible to do this with the Direct Auth SDK?"
"Twitter lookup is based on handle but it resolves to a unique twitter ID, so no, even if you change handle it wont matter"
Yes its doable with directsdk
"What's involved with integrating Moonpay into Direct Auth? I had thought it would be super quick, but now I see that's probably only the case with Torus Wallet?"
Yes only possible with torus wallet
The sdk is a must but the user doesn't need to login to trigger the payment
"The use case right here is that we are looking to abstract some things to non crypto users so they can get xDai. We are planning on using the Top-up method so they can buy some ETH and we wanted to do ETH -> DAI and DAI -> xDai (bridge contract on mainnet) without having them to manually sign & accept these transactions, I didn't expect it to be possibly since that would mean we have access to their private key, but not sure if there was a workaround for that."
"Using torus wallet its not possible, if you use DirectAuth you will have access to the private key so you can. DirectAuth keys are app scoped."
"Hi Torus team. I'm planning to do a live stream where I implement DirectAuth (email magic link + passwordless) and integrate a basic login into a hasura with a custom hasura authentication server (that verififies your ethereum signature).

It would be a great honour to have someone from the torus team join the stream. The plan is for the DirectAuth portion of the stream to take no longer than half an hour.
I usually do my streams on Tuesday and Thursday at 8pm GMT+2. But I understand that the Torus team is in eastern Asia? Would 9am GMT+2 be better (for reference I'm sending this message at 9:23 am GMT+2)."
Hey Torus Team. Is there anyone I can ask a few questions regarding Reddit DirectAuth integration?
yes.. pls tell me
Is there a Flutter (or iOS/Android) integration available for Torus?
"Nice, are you from the torus team or just a developer?"
we also have java/swift SDKs already out
"Quick question
Do you support different Elliptic Curve/Key Derivation?"
"yes we do, you can use the Torus private key (which is an secp256k1 key) as a seed for derivation of other keys"
"Quick question, are there any fiat onramps for any sidechains (xDai/POA, Skale, Matic?). For my use-cases it will basically be impossible to use a side chain without a fiat onramp, so eagerly waiting for the first sidechain to get that right!"
"Also, just a note, the library currently logs the users private key to the console when it runs, which isn't  ideal"
"When a user logs-in with their FB account we get an access token which has access to their name, email and photo. Is there a way we can request for extra permissions?"
Not at the moment
"Hey everyone! Thanks for inviting Arya and I from Uni to collaborate and learn from you here. üôè

question about i18n: are you planning to support more languages? we think Torus has potential in latin america
"Sure, what languages do you want to add?"
Spanish would be nice

Is there a way to revoke and refresh an existing private key for my social account?
"For instance, if my google account gets hacked then my private key for the google account is corrupted. In this situation, even if I take back my google account by changing the password, the private remains the same. Right?"
So there's no way to revoke the key atm?

It's not for react native. But thanks anyway.
"Hey guys, just moving from using torus twitter sign in on localhost:3000 to my own domain, just wondering where do you get the clientId for Twitter? I can only see the access and consumer api credentials.

"you'll need a new verifier. Also, you need an auth0 account to perform twitter login"
the client id is auth0 client id

"Sorry to bother you, just wondering is there a proxyContractAddress for rinkeby? I couldn‚Äôt find any mention in the documentation."
no.. it's only ropsten/testnet
"Oh okay, thanks for letting me know. üëç"
We are using direct-auth btw
Hey we‚Äôre doing the same :)
"Unfortunately they seem to work on different testnets, Torus uses ropsten and Gnosis uses Rinkeby"
"We just use a ropsten connection for reading contracts related to Torus configuration which are on-chain, but the wallet can be connected to any eth connection"
"there's no way to do this natively from the Torus Wallet at this moment I'm afraid. You can deploy a Gnosis Safe contract via Torus (we support smart contract deployment through our provider connection), and interact with Gnosis Safe in whatever way you choose by calling the contract methods with us as the provider"
"no worries Alex, always happy to answer questions

The Torus Wallet is not a smart contract wallet, so we dont actually need to rely on Ethereum for anything at all. The way the Torus Wallet works is we have a set of nodes that have shares, and after you've logged in to Google and retrieved a JWT, you prove to the nodes that you own a particular wallet, and the nodes return the shares to you. 

That works in its base form, except that without some form of global state which a front end client (like the Torus Wallet) can refer to as a source of truth, there's no way to easily tell what the node set is, or what the endpoints are, or what type of login you're doing, etc. As such, we actually have a set of management contracts on-chain: on ropsten we have a testnet set of contracts that are used for managing information about the testnet cluster, and on Ethereum mainnet we have the production contracts. We could have just as easily used something else, like IPFS, but using Ethereum smart contracts gives us availability and flexibility.

This whole process is just to retrieve your private key, what happens after that is completely the same as what you'd expect in any front-end Ethereum wallet (eg. Metamask) ‚Äî you use the private key to get your Ethereum address, you can connect to any testnet (or even Ethereum based sidechains), and you can use it to do pretty much whatever web3 supports by default."
"its best to think of the API methods on the Torus Wallet as completely unrelated to Ethereum, because that's how it works. The Torus Network just generates private keys via DKG, private key is then retrieved via the Torus Wallet after you login, and after that you're back to using native Ethereum private keys with web3.

in that sense, you can definitely use the Gnosis safe with Torus, since its a smart contract wallet that accepts private keys as owners."
"so there's a Torus testnet (the Teal testnet) and an Ethereum testnet, which one are you referring to?"
"if you're on DirectAuth, you can access it via passing in testnet params in the DirectWebSDK"
"authentication doesnt use gas! None of the user interactions for retrieving their private key are on-chain, so we dont need to spend gas for logins"
This solution is ingenious! üî•üöÄ
"thanks for the kind words Alex :), stay tuned for more updates soon"
Hi! Is there an example of adding biometric authentication to the torus login or would it theoretically be possible? thanks
"Its not available right now, but if you can find a third party provider that does this we can look into it"
Ok. We are working on a data marketplace and developing a prototype for biometric identification/authentication. It would be interesting to explore possible integration into Torus when it's finished.
"You might also want to look into Facetec, they provide biometric authentication based on face images. I also looked into their key management and how it could be improved. Could be interesting for them to use the Torus key management?"
Do they offer a JWT authentication mechanism?
"I would suggest using one of the web3 submodules, there's a signing module that's lightweight, ethersjs should work pretty well too and its lightweight"
That sounds great üëç Thanks! üôè
"Hey guys, sorry to keep bothering you! At the moment, we‚Äôre using a custom verifier to authenticate (cawfree-auth0-twitter) and this works great üëç. We‚Äôre also using torusUtils.getPublicAddress to find addresses, but this only works when we use the example verifier (torus-auth0-twitter), but not our custom verifier (node results do not match). Is this expected behaviour? Would the resolved addresses change depending on the verifier we query?"
Could you give us the jrpc errors that are coming back from the network tab?
You can  them to me
Thanks a lot Zhen! I‚Äôll just be a couple of minutes getting these for you.
"Hey all, does someone know how to add custom ERC20 Tokens to the wallet?"
at the moment you can't

we show most tokens after the refresh
Okay Thanks for the Info Zhen! I wanted to show a token I just deployed for testing

hello!
good pricing too.
Do you have any plans to support react native?
"thanks, glad to hear, as for your question about xDai network, it should just work if it follow the EIP1193 spec for the rpc endpoint"
"I see you have a swift / java SDK, so we could obviously extend it ourselves."
"Yeah, we don't have anything on xdai yet"
"one of the our integrations have actually started work on a flutter version, but no react native wrapper exists yet, would be amazing if you guys would want to work on it"
But looking at it for Cryptovoxels Wearables.
"if you guys are working on a simple react native wrapper around our native libs, we could start a group with our ios and android devs, it'll get done a lot faster that way and you can ask more implementation specific questions there"
"do you have any logs?
what versions of web3modal and torus-embed are you using?"
Yeah it‚Äôs a CORS problem
I had to create an API to hit which returned the info
"hey thanks for the reply. Not sure if I understand your fix completely, as in, did you create a backend that is storing the info? Were you working with web3Modal or Torus Wallet directly (and you still had the same issue)?"
No there‚Äôs no info to store
Basically I created an api method which just makes the same request to getUserInfo and then return the result to the caller
I accept the verifier and verifierId as URL parameters.
"Since it‚Äôs server to server there‚Äôs no CORS problem, that only lives in the browser"
"from the error message, it seems like the getUserInfo API on our SDK is trying to return you a reference to a DOM object that's scoped to our iframe, and iirc we serialize everything before sending it through our API so I'm not sure how it's happening, a reproducible example would really help"
"hey no problem :), glad it works"
"Hey guys, really excited to let you know that I‚Äôve managed to get torus working inside of an embedded WebView! I‚Äôll be publishing the implementation soon. üöÄüöÄüöÄ"
Exciting stuff!
Can someone share an example instance where I can take a better look at the integration of torus wallet instead of Metamask
Their frontend side code repo is what would be really helpful.
"Or any of your frontend github where torus wallet is integrated, that js file would also help directly."
"Thanks, let me check this out."
This is what's getting displayed on clicking login :/
Looks like the service worker isn‚Äôt registered
Have you checked the console?
"Yes, here it is"
Can you check the CSS file is being served? Also is there anything interesting in the network tab?
"Not really. Also, the css file seems to be missing in the repo I guess"
"The pop up error looks interesting, what is the error"

yup.. that would work too
"Also, could you point me to the correct doc for this?"
This seems to be an important point and is currently missing in the doc. Might want to add it?
Sure.. we'll add it
network:
Please how do I add tokens in my Torus platform
"What I'm essentially trying to ask is, how can I give permission to the application so that there's not a pop up to be confirmed every single time and only the confirmation done once is enough for the rest of the send transactions."

hi all
Is it possible to run a node to join the testnet now for the Torus ?
"unfortunately the current testnet is a managed cluster so no, there's no easy way to do it unless you run a cluster yourself"
Does anyone know how to integrate torus with some other chain like Zilliqa?
Hello folks! Quick question: does DirectAuth work with Twitter yet?
It does
Our example here uses auth0 twitter login
Thanks!
A developer from my team tried to look into it and tried multiple fixes but was mentioning that this might need a fix from Torus' side. Could you maybe have a look and confirm the same?
"Also, I'm facing issues while trying to make use of Google and Twitter Direct auth on iOS platform for some reason üòï
Any chance you might have come across a similar issue before?"
"Firstly, thanks for such an amazing project.

Has anyone had success using Torus with a Cosmos SDK based blockchain? It seems this should be possible with DirectAuth...

Is it possible yet to configure other networks such as a Cosmos SDK or Substrate based chain?

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated, I'm really looking forward to integrating this."
"Yep, check out keplr chrome extension"
That code is private.
"I see, lemme try asking them for a simple example so others building on Cosmos can use it"
"Thanks, that would be AMAZING."
It is a architecture scheme from official site
What is the Node List?
It's the list of nodes on torus network
It is a just list in my dapp?
you can check them out here
It won't be in your dapp. You don't have to worry about it. Our SDKs will take care of the interaction with the nodes!
"so, the torus network based on ethereum?"
am i right?
No. It is a proof of stake system
what will happen if all of the nodes will shuts down? I will lose my key?
and one more question - can i export my private key?
"Yes, you can!"
where can i read about private key export?
thanks
No sweat!
"If we have a web 2.0 part of our application, how can we use Torus for Authentication with that? We wouldn't want a user to have to login twice.

I know Torus is using Auth0 under the hood, but after going through the Auth0 docs there seems to be some missing pieces. For example, there is no accessToken JWT returned... although, an access token is returned, I'm not quite sure what format it's in.

I do see the ID token JWT, has anyone been able to use that for user authentication against a web 2.0 endpoint?"
so the way it works is the DirectAuth SDK just needs an input of a idToken
"we provide helper methods like triggerLogin to open the popup for users to sign in with Auth0, but if you want, you can handle that yourself completely, and only handover the flow to the DirectAuth SDK at the end, after the user has been authenticated with your platform"
Would DirectAuth ever support HD wallets? I‚Äôm guessing not because I don‚Äôt think DKG works with mnemonics.
"Hi, I am from Perlin, we would like to explore on torus for smart wallet integration"
should we be requsting for  to get a test-net spun up?
"I'm using DirectAuth SDK, can I get Mnemonic from Torus after I logged in ?"
thats all that is necessary
what you get is a key pair
representing it in a mnemonic
is possilbe
you can use the BIP39 dictionary and spec to covert it both ways
"to clarify, you can represent your Torus private key as a mnemonic, but this mnemonic isn't compatible with Metamask's seed phrase standard"
Hi is there any reference for the relay-contracts integration with torus wallet?
"We some dev tooling that can help you set it up but its based on an older version of an Argent smart contract fork, at this point its probably better to use Argent newer more updated smart contracts"
"Hi guys, I'm using torus-direct-web-sdk package, it work well on localhost and firebase hosting, but when I upload source to AWS S3 it not work"
"ah right, you need to serve the serviceworker redirect.html on that specified path"
"alternatively, just run it with skipSw: true in the SDK"
"Hi guys, I see Torus web-direct-sdk return privateKey and publicAddress when user login. How can I get publicKey ?"
You can create the public key from the private key using any ec libraries
We'll be releasing this feature in the upcoming version. Eta: 26th
oh.. great ü§òüèªü§òüèª Thanks

"Hello, have you implemented the avalanche wallet?"
Hi how can I get a custom verifier?
"I am struggling in adding custom ERC20 token in torus wallet, does anyone have any tip to do so?"
"Actually, I make one custom token ERC20 based in matic testnet now I send some of the tokens to my gmail account address (in torus) from the (deployer's account in metamask). After that when I click on Show all tokens it is not showing! 
Do we have to add that token manually like in metamask?"
Both are same!
We show custom tokens only for mainnet
"redirectToOpener usually is only used for Chrome extension integrations, the reason we have it is because most OAuth providers don't allow redirect to chrome extension URLs"
"the hosted domain is needed because the developer should have full control over where the JWT token is being accessed, if we host a redirect for you, we could intercept the JWT token and spoof a login"
"moreover, you should host the redirect path on the same path as where you do the login, because we have a serviceworker caching mechanism for the redirect page, reduces page loads for users + prevents malicious hosting servers from modifying the redirect page after it has been cached in the user's browser"
"Hey,I am using Torus-wallet and is there any way to use only google for authentication instead of other services?"
"Thnks for the reply,

"hi AS, can you try adding ',  '}, "" on your torus.init( )? it seems that showOnModal doesn't work if "",  , ' is not there\n\n',  ,\n          loginConfig:  ,\n          },\n        })', 'language': ''}"
"yes thnx,it worked!"
"thanks for the answer! Well, I think that for an electron case, ',  , "" could be the way to go (perhaps I'm wrong üòÖ), thinking that OAuth providers don't allow redirection to a "",  , ' protocol for a packed electron app or perhaps for an electron app the approach could be different ü§® I will really appreciate your thoughts on an electron case üôè'"
"for sure, that applies for electron apps as well!"
"if that doesnt work, you can host your own redirect endpoint on a separate webpage, and then use that to relay the JWT information to the electron app"
redirectToOpener should generally just work in most cases
"awesome! My doubts now are on the ',  , ' field in the the ',  , ' contructor. Should the ',  , ' field be the url that I changed in the ',  , ' by using ',  , ' ?'"
the baseUrl should be where you hosted the redirect.html
"redirectToOpener always sends the JWT to the window.opener, and the URL you change in the redirect.html is to ensure that you don't just forward it any page, you should forward it to only the origin page (eg. chrome-extension://asdfasdf"
"greatt, will take a look to cyano wallet and thanks again üôè"
"Hi I'm trying to get started with Torus DirectAuth but I keep getting this error: 
index.js:2177 Error: node results do not match
    at torusUtils.cjs.js:8"
"I check the Network log and the response error is ""Verifier not supported"". I think someone had this error before so can you give me some guides on how to troubleshoot this? Thanks a lot!"
You will need a verifier deployed for your client-id. Ping me your client id and we will add the verifier.
is there anyway I can check if the verifier is deployed or not?
Yes we would like to run our entire operation on top of the rinkeby blockchain currently. Are we only set up for mainnet?
"Also, where can one find the proxy contract address for rinkeby?"
"there's none, our ropsten testnet proxy contract is a coordinator contract, it doesnt have to be the same as the Ethereum network you're on"
so you can just use the ropsten on for your testing purposes on rinkeby
"So any recommendation on an error ""node results do not match"""
Yeah we need to deploy a verifier for you
"Hey Leonard, how easy is it to use Torus with Cosmos at this stage?"
"its already used :), check out Keplr chrome extension wallet, it's using Torus"
"you'll need to use the Torus private key to derive an ed25519 Cosmos compatible private key, but beyond that, it's not too complicated"
"looks like Infura is back up, you should be able to access your wallet now"
so I need to link user's wallets somehow. Looks like I can either link multiple accounts when a user logs in or after a user has already logged in
"but sounds like if someone has an account through say Twitter and someone invites them through discord, there's no way to connect them right now?"
thank you üôè
hmmm could you expand a bit more on this flow?
do you mean two seperate users? or the same user with a twitter that then gets invited on discord
via the user initiated method
"Is it possible to customize this, and add say a metamask link?"
Is it possible to customise this on torus-embed to add a metamask link for example?
Let's say we're building a messaging app like telegram. The flow: alice signs up to app with their twitter account (we then create torus keys for them). Bob then invites alice to his group chat. He invites alice with her discord account.
because it's bad ux for users to have 10 different accounts because they were invited through 10 different services
you might want that control but 99% of people don't
"True!
But,  Think from root level if someone have created 2 gmail account it means he wants to keep his identity(as in email address) different on different platform."
not necessarily
"Also I agree on the UX point... Many won't control it! 

For that point you have to merge account on your side. (Same like github does) 
It makes primary secondary email address relationship.. user have to verify their secondary accounts then you can do action on/by your that account."
Someone have to take a pain to do that... you or user!
but users can merge the accounts?
that is what I am trying to do
you can do so post login as well
"it will require that you logiin and authenticate with both logins, and should be user initiated"
as stated here
its possible to detect metamask
by checking if its injecteed and not load up torus perhaps?
thats a flow thats commonly used
"Hey Zhen, sounds good, do you know someone who does this already, that I can have a look? Even better some code ;)"
You can use this package to detect metamask and initialize other providers as necessary
Thanks guys
"Hi, can you help me ? I  have need to find mnemonic key of my torus wallet. Could you please  help me, from where i can get it."
"hi there, you can export the private key through your settings!"
For sure!
"Hey guys, is Twitter authentication down for you?"
Just suddenly stopped working about 30mins ago
"Ah, sorry for the error!"
"It looks like it was associated with my account, I think I might have exceeded a quota. My apologies!"
"Login works great locally, but when I deploy to our testnet domain I get an error trying to login with Torus:

Callback URL mismatch.
The provided redirect_uri is not in the list of allowed callback URLs.
Please go to the Application Settings page and make sure you are sending a valid callback url from your application.

After signing up will I be able to access the applications settings page to fix this? Seems like this is a simple Auth0 configuration issue..."
"DMed, we can help to take a look"
Thanks!
Yup. You need to whitelist the new redirect uri in auth0
How then can I access Auth0?
Do I go through them or you?
Ah.! You need to create your own auth0 account and get a verifier setup for you
"Oh, ok, that makes sense."
Thanks.
"So after signing up with Auth0 and updating the Client ID in our frontend code, I'm getting a different error: ""invalid_request: The client was not found""

I assume that's because I don't have a verifier setup for me yet?"
yeah.. it isn't working with https
only http
"Yes, I filled out the form. Just waiting to hear back I guess. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
we are actually creating videos with verifier setup atm
we would really appreciate a PR from a dev perspective
Videos would be great. Will try to get a PR in.
Thanks again for the help.
thanks so much jake
appreciate hte feedback
will work on nit
"right now the SDK only returns one key (even though the Torus Network supports multiple keys), so if you want multiple keys you can use the ""account #0"" as a seed to a HD wallet to get multiple accounts.

On a related note, there's pros and cons to our decision to only return a single key from the SDK. 

Although it is more limiting in terms of functionality, the main benefits are that it's easier for developers to ""verify"" the user without having to loop through a list of valid accounts, and also in the future the user may even choose to only expose a single account, which might not even be a Torus-key, but might even be some other abstraction (eg. tKey). 

if you have a specific use case in mind we can probably work together with you to find the best solution that fits it :)"
"yep we saw it, we'll review it soon, thanks for the PR btw"
Please let me know if you need anything else
"Great thank you, I'll check this out."
"Hello guys , can you help me ? I  have need to find mnemonic key of my torus wallet to connect with zksync . If torus wallet don't  have mnemonic key in that case how can we conncet with zksync"
"Theres no mnemonic, mnemonics are used to generate private keys, and Torus wallet uses private keys directly"
You should be able to use zksync with wallet connect
With Torus
"alternatively i think zksync has a key generation protocol which is compatible with web3 providers (where they use determinsitic signatures to derive a key, compatible with their l2). if thats the case we should be compatible too"
"alternatively do look at directAuth for full control of keys on the front-end, be it for encryption/ wallet usage"
"Hi there,
Quick (naive) question üòÅ Would you recommend storing the pk in the local storage to persist the ""session"" ?"
"you can use localstorage, but preferably use sessionstorage since its less persistent"
"but yes, it should be kept in the browser for the session"
"thanks but sessionstorage survives a refresh but not closing/opening tab, right? which means, a user has to login again if he comes back.
On the other hand, localstorage doesn't expire but it sounds like a dangerous game to expose pk so openly :/"
"Torus wallet doesnt allow you to do that, since that key is used across dapps, but if you are on directauth, which has app scoped keys, you can access the private key via the SDK"
how long does it take to review the registration  and approve  ?
less than a day
thanks!
Hey mates - submitted the form to get a Discord verifier deployed for Flex Dapps
Keen to try out Torus ü§†
awesome!
"Hi,
Where can I find more information about the Torus network? (for e.g how many torus nodes are live?)"
"great, thanks"
"Hi, quick question about aggregation.\nLet\'s say i\'d like to offer Google, Twitter (auth0) and email/pw (auth0) as auth method. If the email is the same, I\'d like the user to retrieve the same key whatever auth method he uses.\nI sounds like this is what is explained under the section ""Aggregating Logins/Verifiers"" of the docs.\nI can find any example how this work and how do I have to register my verifier?\nDo I need to call ',  , ' instead of ',  , ' ?\nThe only piece of code I can find is here (',  , ') \nIs there any other resource to helm me out with this.\nThanks!'"
"there are many possible ways to implement this, but the best flow is usually what we call the ""user-initiated account linking"" flow"
"this is where the app, upon detecting that the same email is used (or perhaps if the user is accessing it from the same browser) decides to prompt the user to link accounts"
"trying to link accounts solely via email isn't a stable approach because a lot of federated authenticators (eg. Facebook, Discord) don't always verify the email, which means that the user can misreport his / her email"
"another popular way is to link it via Auth0's account linking feature, and using a separate user identity provided by Auth0 as the user ID"
are you using your verifier?
or the one in the examples?
"the most likely explanation is misconfigured settings, if you have a deployed testing site we can walk you through it"
what is the best way to integrate Torus to  chrome extension  app
any examples ?
Did you ever find a solution for this?
"Now I am getting this - I understand the Discord token is valid for 30 minutes and I have to revoke it, but what is not documented is where I find the Discord token, is anyone able to help me find this?"
"Seems like it was a rate limit from infura.
I think there is an infura endpoint hardcoded in the sdk. Would be nice to be able to override it with our own eth rpc endpoint."
Ah ok - good to know it's not my fault. Agree that custom RPC is a nice to have üëç
Did you get Discord Auth working?
Nop so far I've only used Google as well as github and email-password through auth0.
"Awesome, would love to check out what you are building some time"
we'd need to take a look at the rpc error that comes back resulting in the error
if you have it check out the network tab for the jrpc responses from the torus nodes
pm them to me i'll be able to help!
"as in, getting the discord token back to continue interacting with their API?"
Do you mean to integrate direct auth.?
"you can use a custom RPC.!\nJust pass in your own url into ',  , ' param of constructor (It accepts an enum usually but you can send in your own ethereum ropsten or ethereum mainnet endpoints to access torus testnet or mainnet respectively\n',  , ' ',  "

"Great, good to know!"
"Hello! quick question - with Torus wallet, how do I capture the event when a user logs out?"
"and another question: the web3.currentProvider.sendAsync for the eth_signTypedData_v4 method, this is not 100% compatible with metamask right? I am playing with it and the popup window shows the data to sign struct, but without the data"
which is not very user friendly...
Hey.. the data seems to be there but isn't visible because of dark mode. We'll fix it soon
"aah cool, let me try without dark mode - is it possible to have the ""message"" opened up by default? because that's what will give the user an idea of what they're signing"
"also, how do I capture the event when a user logs out (Torus wallet)?"
"seems like a potential problem with torus is that a malicious site can steal a user's private key just by getting a user to sign in, no?"
"did you mean, if a developer creates another Google login on their site and tricks a user into logging in there? 

No, this attack doesn't work because of the whitelisted redirect URLs in OAuth applications, that attack would only work if the application uses an open redirect (which is insecure)"
"Thanks, do you have any code sample of accountsChanged? I couldn't find it in the docs"
This is a web3 provider event
We emit that same event
Through our provider
"sorry got confused - great! what about the sendAsync popup ? is there any way to make it more like metamask, where it just displays the contents of the message property?"
"you mean, without the word ""permission""?"
"We can probably add support if it isn't too complicated, could you open an issue on Github?"
I'll Open an issue and be more specific
"Error: Unable to resolve enough promises, errors: null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null, responses:  ,""id"":10}, ,""id"":10}, ,""id"":10}, ,""id"":10}, ,""id"":10}, ,""id"":10}, ,""id"":10}, ,""id"":10}, ,""id"":10}, predicate: invalid

Hi Torus devs... I would like to find out if it is possible to use Torus DirectAuth for storage of users E2E encryption keys for a decentralised storage application.
Hello mates
"I am using Torus DirectAuth for Discord, but I would like to ask for more OAuth2 scopes in my app, is that possible? I assume that the OAuth URL is generated by Torus SDK internally?"
"you can, instead of using the triggerLogin, do the authentication flow by yourself first, and then pass the discord token as idtoken when calling getTorusKey"
"yes it is, but did you know.. we now support eth_getEncryptionPublicKey and eth_decrypt! that was recently added to Metamask's Ethereum provider spec and we have updated our wallet to also provide that functionality, you should definitely check it out, it's probably what you need"
"Hi Leonard, thanks for getting back to me. Could I possibly pick your brain around some of the key management challenges that we are trying to solve with Chainsafe Files?"
"For sure, DMed"
hi Maksim
saw you question in the official chat
"it's not possible to customise it right now since that's a standard eip 712 signing screen, but if you can open an issue, or even better submit a PR on our github, we can merge it into our upcoming releases"
Thanks
Perhaps whitelabelling the screens in your brand/projects style may also help it not be so jarring to your users
The torus wallet sdk allows you to input your logo/colors and other theming to edit those screens
"Hi all,
I registered for a DirectAuth verifieer the day before yesterday via the Google Form but didn't get anything back yet...any chance you could have a look at it? 
Many thanks!"
Awesome thanks!!
"You can find an example of whitelabeling here\n',  , '\n\n',  , '  - you can add a ',  , ' param on initializing torus object\n\n',  , ' - here is an example of whitelabel data which you can use'"
Thank you!

taking this to DM
Hi there! Are there any limitations when using auth0 which in its turn is connected to another OpenID IdP? Is this flow supported or not? I'm getting an exception raised while trying this out...
Hi. Are there any limitations for using direct-auth-sdk?
could you clarify? what kind of limitations are you referring to?
"Idk, any? Logins limit? Limitations related to using testnet instead of mainnet?"
"there's a predefined global rate limit for new user signup for testnet, but it's high enough that you probably won't run into issues during testing

directAuth has separate rate limits based on your plan for new user signups, but the default one is also high enough that you won't run into issues

logins have a much higher rate limit since that's just a series of normal server calls (doesnt do any heavy crypto operations like DKG),

testnet is , as the name suggests, a test network, so stability isn't guaranteed there, we deploy new features on the test network pretty often for prototyping. the testnet is run by Torus, so it's centralised. Please don't use this in production.

the mainnet is run by a network of nodes run by Etherscan, Cosmos, Binance, ENS, etc. and we run one of those nodes as well, you can verify this for yourself in the network tab in Chrome devtools when you're on a mainnet integrated application.  

I would say, there aren't many limitations since we just provide basic private keys, so you're only limited by what you can accomplish with native private keys. Perhaps one limitation is that directAuth does not come with pre-built UI, but that also allows developers to provide a better user experience by incorporating user interactions directly into their app."

"I'm returning to a project after a while that is using Torus. We seem to have this chunky popup box in our signin flow which we didn't have before.

Is this because they switched from DirectAuth back to Embed? Is this box necessary in order to sign a message?
Is there any way around it?
Would switching back to direct auth allow us to bypass this?"
I would add that the only reason we are signing this message is so that we can authenticate with our api and create a jwt
"Yes, directauth doesnt have this"
"Is this because in direct auth we have the private key which we can use to sign the message, and in embed we don't?"
And theres no way to allow arbitrary signing of messages or dapps would be able to sign transfers withour consent

Is there any document for new customPrefix eth_sign feature that we can read ??
not really but there's an example
"this allows you to sign messages prefixed with the domain name of the dapp, in a manner very similar to the ""Ethereum Signed Message"" spec"
thanks! it does not support other sign function like eth_signTypedData right ?
Its purpose is to allow dapps to verify the user without a popup
"Most dapps use personal sign or eth sign to do this, and that results in an unnecessary popup, using custom prefixes no popup is shown if the prefix is the same as the dapp domain"
yeah it sort of makes sesen in a way that eth_signTypedData aims to enhance UX by explicitly showing the data to sign for end users

I'm currently building a product with DirectAuth using two providers:

"Thanks, I'll take a look"
"I think the second option (common unique identifier) is the most straightforward solution as I believe in 99.9% of the case, the same email address will mean the same profile ans thus Ethereum account.

let me try to reproduce it
"ok thanks,please let me know."
"Hello, we are getting this error:"
Anyone know what can be happening?
yeah torus is down for me
3 devs for 3/4 hours each going crazy trying to figure this out
ughhh rate limits on infura and matic screw me up all the time
at least I can finally go to bed
I‚Äôm one of those devs üëÜhi guys!
"hey guys, just noticed the problem again with Infura, we hit the daily rate limits of Infura once again even though we recently upgraded to the highest publicly available plan, we're working out something custom with them, please be patient while this happens.

If you're in DirectAuth and this is mission critical to you, please consider adding your own Infura connection, DirectAuth doesn't make many API calls to Infura so it should comfortably fit within the free tier for most developers"
"Hi, do you have any estimation by how much time it get fixed? 
Actually we are in mid of hackathon üòÖ! After integration just realised that our application is breaking due to this issue? 
If it takes long time, we will go with latter solution!"
its already fixed
"it was fixed before this, we secured a 3x rate limit increase from Infura but we're working towards an even more scalable solution with their team"
do a hard reload
Yes! That was the problem with my cache.. i did it.. thanks!
How do I get involved in the project
build something with us!
that good
"Hi there, we're integrating Torus/DirectAuth and I have some questions. We would like to use directAuth to smoothen the UX, but does that mean the user gets an app-specific wallet instance? I.e. are the deposited funds only available to the logged-in app? Or could the user also easily access the wallet (for instance) via Torus in another app? Oh and kodus for the smooth dev experience, I had a PoC running in under like 15 minutes, which can not be said for all products üôÇ"
Thank you for your feedback too! We're always open to suggestions!
the user to NOT notice he/she is using Web3
Do you expect the user to make transactions to other applications often?
"No not often, but we want to prevent the user having to think about managing multiple wallets. For instance, in my case, I think about my non-technical friends. Maybe a detail, but there's also the implied challenge of ending up with 10 wallet each containing small amounts which cannot be withdrawn. Another point for having a single wallet instance available over multiple apps"
"Good morning, after a happy day of progress a second question. It's related to the docs and the SDK. We're building on Matic and 1) the modal shows ERC20 and 2) the transaction value in Wei. Is there an option to modify this? I could not find anything on GitHub or in your docs. Could you point me in the right direction?"
"Hello Folks, does anyone know how can I add the eth address (username) in the JWT(id token) payload?"
This is not going to be required anymore. Cheers
"We have a diffrent issue now:

verifier: xxx-auth0-twitter
verifierId: twitter|XXXXXX

Error: node results do not match at first lookup"
Would you know why we are getting this error?
"Hey, can you dm me"
"Unfortunately, there's no easy way to modify this. We'll look into what we can do. Pls raise an issue on GitHub"
"if you use Torus Wallet, it will only use a single wallet, and you'll get a unified experience across applications.

If you're on DirectAuth it's not possible to use the same private key since that would mean that a rogue dapp could get access to the user's key, which would be problematic for the user."
You're welcome üôÇ
"Great, I'll do that. Thank you!"
"Hi Chaitanya, need some help"
"At verifier's interface (where you obtain client id), please use baseUrl/redirect (eg: http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/redirect) as the redirect_uri where baseUrl is the one passed while instantiating DirectWebSdk"
I am not seeing a redirect url at verifiers interface...
Which verifier are you trying to use?
Using Google and testnet
Directauth verifier
"You should configure the redirect url, https://localhost:3000/service worker/redirect, in google‚Äôs developer dashboard."
"hi Krishna, are we already in a group chat? let's continue our discussion there"
Is there a support for phone number authentication available or in the works?
"Alright, thanks"
hello guys! could you please suggest any documentation on account resolver for Twitter identifier and Tezos blockchain? I am looking for a solution to retrieve the tezos public keys from twitter ids
"you mean, to get the user's private key from a backend..?"
"we don't have support for that, and it's also not recommended that it's done that way, but if you're on DirectAuth you can already do that today by forwarding the private key to your own servers"
What do you mean by forward private key to our servers? We want to be non-custodial as much as possible
"if you are able to directly access the private key on the backend, that would not be non-custodial unfortunately"
"What‚Äôs the rate limit for requests to a torusnode, to get the public keys?"
"Please hang on, our dev team will respond shortly"
"it really depends on a bunch of factors, there are no hard rate limits put in place. The bottleneck tends to be around the generation of the private keys via the DKG, as well as the consensus on assignments between the Torus nodes.

All Torus nodes also have a proxy server that manages incoming requests in a queue with an exponential backoff strategy, so if you query too quickly and no available keys have been generated, you're put into a queue and the request will take longer than usual, or eventually timeout."
"after a user has been assigned a key, retrieving shares (logging in) is very cheap since there's no communication across nodes for that. In production we've seen the system handle on the order of 10 key assigns per second and 1000 key retrieves per second"
on testnet (which is running on slower hardware) we've tested it to 5x of that and it eventually fulfills all the requests except at a slower rate
just do it at a rate of 1 a second that should be fine
Alright! Thanks!
"Can I do the same with Torus, and if so how? Do I just add it in Torus.init ?"
We currently don't support that feature
The user can check the status of the transaction in his/her activity page on torus wallet
"Also, the top up api is a promise representing the top up flow finish"
don't understand that part
ok thanks Chaitanya
Is it possible once a user has logged using torus to change the torus network from mainnet to xdaichain?
Yeah we're looking into it
Thanks for the update. Is there a management dashboard or status page in the works? Would be nice to see our verifier details and network status in one spot.
"Ah, thank you!"
but i think we deployed yours mannually
"Yes, I remember them being deployed manually."
Can I just sign in with my email? Or do we need to resubmit to use the new dashboard?
just sign in!
Great.
"Testnet is back up, but there are still issues in AWS ap-northeast-1 Tokyo region, there may still be intermittent downtime, we're monitoring the situation"
"Hi there, the screenshot above illustrated 2 issues we're facing. 1) we're on Mumbai but the token is ETH (is assume the 'native token symbol' is hardcoded somewhere?), for which I already kicked the GitHub issue and 2) where does the 0.01 value come from? The USD value suggests we're going to send MATIC, but 0.01ETH with ~0.0015USD is simple very confusing."
"Am I missing something that I should have configured, for instance? Or is this an issues with using different layers/network other than Ethereum (like, O.G. layer 1 Ethereum)"
can you raise this as an issue on our github.?
"Sure, and let me know if I can be of any support, this is a semi-blocker for us so if I can help speed this along I could budget some time"
Just a sanity check- I'm using Torus embed but you want the issue on Torus website?
Yes.. correct
we will fix this issue asap and release by Friday
"Wow, that's incredibly fast, kudos!"
Hello Torus team. We are using torus wallet for our application and have a lot of console logs after user registration. How we can turn them off?
"I do not know why, but this method does not work (Why so? Maybe there is another?"
Which build env are you targeting? Testing etc. have logs enabled by default. Only production has logs disabled
Hello can you help me
"Hi, What do you need assistance with?"
have you set your tkey account up?
Ok I will reach out to devs with your email and get back to you
Ok joined
did you use Google login or passwordless?
I want to run torus node
How can i start?
"We're not accepting Torus node operators at the moment, but do stay tuned for further updates"
Yes. Thk
Can i participate testnet node??
"Hey all, how is the ‚Äòusers / month‚Äô calculated for DirectAuth?"
"Also, what results a ‚Äònode results do not match‚Äô error?"
unique logins per month
What would be a good way to track that from our end?
"that's just a generic error, usually a more specific error can be found in the stack trace"
"you could just get the returned ethereumAddress and track that, we're working on an update to the developer dashboard which should give you this information in the dashboard"
"Any suggestions on how to find the stack trace within a browser?

One of our users logged in on a different computer and got the ‚Äònode results do not match‚Äô error."

DMed you
"Hi, 
i wants to get authentication token for user's authentication after login via Torus wallet, is there any way to do this?
I know this is possible in directAuth, but i am using Torus wallet."
just use a signature
"eth sign on somehting like ""logged in to app"""
timestamp perhaps
Hello. I'm trying since last night to login to opensea using my Torus wallet but it stays in loop waiting.
Please if someone could provide some insight over this problem.
Opensea has some troubles with Torus integration currently. We're talking to the team to get it resolved asap
Thank you
"Hi, Im encountering the same problem with ethers. Did you find any solution?"
Thanks a lot! üòäüëç
i think that is web3 equivalent for ethers signMessage
Does anyone know until when the login problem with opensea is going to be resolved?
"No eta but it should be sooner..

Devs are looking into this"
Thank you so much
I'm afraid of using my credentials in other sites
"Looks very fishy, dont fall for it 

at worst case contact trezor official support\"
Trezor is not torus?
It had the same symbol
You mentioned trezor
It said trezor on the chat member
"look further, I think it is a scam dont fall for it"
Trying to help me get to opensea
Because I can't login to opensea
It is scam
OK. Thank God I blocked.
awesome... thanks for confirming!!!
They had Trezor Support instead of Torus support.
I didn't even remember the Trezor wallets
didn'0t associate since the symbol for the account was the same.
no problem.. glad you are safe!!!
I'm very noob
do you know the status of the login to opensea? if it's solved?
that's a twitter handler?
Ok. Sorry. I didn't know if it was a problem with development.
thank you.
I'm looking at using DirectAuth and would like to integrate it with AWS Cognito
"Would someone please ‚Äî if you wouldn't mind üòÖ ‚Äî clarify for me what ""provide us"" means exactly?"
"Ok, thanks Elisha üôÇ Is there an API that would enable me to programmatically register a new clientID?"
You'll get your API key/verifier ID once you set up your client ID
"Ok, well I was more wondering whether or not DirectAuth was capable of supporting my use case. I'm building a platform, where I have an organisation model, and I'm looking to implement a multi-tenancy architecture. With Cognito, I then would like to either: programmatically create new application clients, in a single Cognito User Pool; or, programmatically create entirely new Cognito User Pools; for every user that signs up and creates a new organisation."
"From what I can gather though, it appears as if I would need to register a new verifier for every new application client, regardless of whether it belongs to the same user pool or not. Is that right?"
"the way the verifier works, it just needs to be signed by the same JWKs key"
"so if you need a multitenancy model, you can manage it yourself, as long as they're all using the same JWKs key"
"the most common way is to prefix the userid field with some kind of app-specific prefix (Auth0 does this, via something like AppName|1234567)"
"Ok cool, that sounds promising then"
Thank you
"nope, not at the moment"
"Ok, no worries, thanks üëç"

"Hello, so I am trying to log in with discord and see the ""Duplicate token"" error. I see that I have to revoke the token, but if I do not have it stored, is there some easy way to grab the token?"
Direct Auth sdk returns the token. You can use it to revoke it
"Ok sure, right now I am using for registerLogin, but how can I get the token if register login returns an error?"
triggerLogin
"A technical question. Can I store any type of key material in the torus network? We have built an app(non-blockchain), where we generate keys on the device, and we would like to store these split keys(Shamir) on the torus network."
you can use the Torus key to encrypt your key material and store that encrypted data on some kind of distributed filesystem like IPFS
"such a setup has very similar guarantees, we currently store metadata about the user in this way to ensure that even peripheral information about the user's wallet is distributed"
"PMed, it's probably just a config error"
"its encrypted tho, so its not at risk, you can use your own storage layer if you want"
one which allows you to delete
This would be perfect
We would go for a distributed storage layer. How can we achieve this with Torus?
"Hey all, does anyone know of any public examples where Torus Direct Auth has been combined with Firebase / Firestore auth?
I've got the basics working but it would be nice to compare notes
Mostly I'm considering the best way to link Firebase auth with Torus - currently in testing I'm just using the retrieved private key as the user's ID, but I imagine that's not great from a security standpoint..."
side note - what's the best way to check for Torus auth between routes? Is anything relevant stored in localStorage or sessionStorage?
You can derive public key from private key on frontend and use it as user id.
don't know how I missed those values...)
You can simply use eccrypto js npm library or torus/eccrypto library (getPublic function) to get the pub key in buffer format and from buffer you can get the hex string
X is generally better
But in general more ppl use cognito/auth0
Cognito cause the passowrdless feels a bit better
"so erm its cause of the way secp256k1 curve is shaped/works, the x value carries more information than y and actually can derive y"
take a look at compressed pub keys
ah interesting! Thanks - will look into it
"I attempted to transfer some REEF Finance tokens from Binance to my Torus wallet @ 11 hours ago.  It still hasn't shown up, - what should I do?"
"did you, maybe, use Google login instead of passwordless login?"
logging in with Google gives you a different wallet from the passwordless login
"yes, i used google login"

"hi all - curious what the best resource is for setting up custom login verifier? i've setup a google oauth verifier (which was very simple), but docs for custom seem slim."
is auth0 a strict prereq? i have a meteor app that i'd like to integrate. i understand sapien network did same thing.
Like firebase or auth0? Yes you would need to register that as well
"So no auth0 is not strict. Really anything that complies with the jwt spec works with torus, all you need is a jwk endpoint"
You can opt to use the OIDC spec too
That just works
i have looked at this. are there more docs for supporting ‚ÄúUsing your own custom login provider‚Äù?
sure. i‚Äôm familiar with the spec. it‚Äôs more a question of integrating with torus as a verifier. proxy domain is just a dedicated jwt endpoint?
"Yeaps, with torus you define the jwk endpoint, the specific fields in the jwt you want to validate and the unique user identifier (often ""sub"")"
excellent! i‚Äôll give this a try tomorrow. thanks
Nice you meet you guy
"Using your own custom login provider => In my case, I've already have an auth server that response jwt token for user after he/she login => Is able to integrate our existing auth server with torus direct auth?"
haha to all three
setup a jwt verifier
"wrt to this, you can use the .getTorusKey() API on the sdk"
stuff in your jwt that you've retrieved in your login process and it should just work
"Please be aware of a ',  , ' link going around, ',  , ' enter your seedphrase anywhere, including this link: ',  , '\nThere is no Torus token.'"
"several types resolve to jwt - ',  , "". as long as you're directly calling getTorusKey (so manually providing user info), any of those should be good. "",  , ' can you confirm that?'"
because i'm also not seeing a direct JWT verifier type
"Hello,
In the Verifier type drop-down, everything starting from Twitter are JWT verifiers"
Thanks. I'll look into it.
right now the dashboard doesnt support custom JWT verifiers
shoot me a pm and i'll get it setup for you if yours is custom
"I will. I do wonder, however, if Torus provides a token; or an API that retrieves token from the original IDP? We're trying to maintain a session for APIs using Torus for authentication."
"I am using TORUS wallet to make transactions over Quorum network. The requirement is to make a private transaction, for which we need to sign a raw transaction. TORUS does not allow to sign a transaction for security purposes. Is there any way to sign a raw transaction with TORUS wallet?"
i was able to use email/password verifier without problems directly calling getTorusKey
would custom jwt be simpler?
"If it works, it works!"
Custom is really just a edited jwt verifier to suit your jwt/login
The interface that we return is a crypto key
You can treat it as a token? But it doesn't have an expiry
"One way to achieve the sessions that you might want is to use the key to sign on a timestamp/json, authenticating them with your server side stuffs for the duration"
You probably wanna use directAuth instead of the torus wallet
"yes!
1) for your google,facebook ad other oauth verifiers just use localhost as your redirect
2) for passwordless, and other jwt verifiers you simply edit the jwt url to be localhost. That server does have to be hosted tho"
"Hi I'm getting a rate limiter error. Is this something with on Torus side or client-side? As in, are you overloaded or did I make to many requests?"
"On your status page everything seems online, but I wasn't making that many request, just testing the signing flow for Biconomy integration. What are the rate limits for Torus?"
This is related to our error reporting service. Shouldn't affect integration/wallet experience. We'll work on fixing it
"Awesome, thank you"
The error occurs after clicking the approve button in Torus embed to sign a transaction
"Pls log the issue on GitHub with a simple way to reproduce it.
We'll quickly fix it"

That's great. We'll fix it quickly and get back to you
any info on listening to disconnect? 'accountsChanged' doesn't seem to fire. When people leave tabs open over night they get signed out but our app doesn't know so it seems broken.
I should also say: torus is awesome - using torus as a piece of our infrastructure really lets our app have a web2 feel as promised üôÇ
please add an issue on github. we'll fix this. Should be easy
It looks like the issue I mentioned above was temporary - I was eventually able to login
"hello, is there a private sale open?"
There is no information on that right now

Hey yall. I'm trying to integrate torus into my nextjs application but I keep getting this navigator not found error
I have since upgraded to the v4.11.1 version and am now getting a window not found error
this is on custom/direct auth im assuming?
can you create an issue on the repo
we'll check it out
Yes I'm trying to integrate Google login  the direct web sdk.
it's a frontend sdk. Only runs in browser context
Yea I get that
The torussdk is only invoked in componentDidMount as per your example
BTW are there any security pitfalls to look out for when using Torus?
Hey! I have a question from the presentation
Please feel free to drop your questions here üôÇ
So I like the idea of openlogin a lot. I definitely think improving the UX of crypto without sacrificing any security is very important. I however am curious of where you would want to implement openlogin. Would this be for a wallet that implements it or would projects choose to implement them as a login sort of screen?
"The OpenLogin implementation is flexible, and you can implement it both on your own wallet, or your own application project, say if your app requires user account creation"
Very cool! I like this a lot. Very slick. :)
My team and I are picking out which sponsor integrations we like the most and I will definitely have this one on the list!
I‚Äôd love to do them all but for a 3 week hackathon we can probably only choose one or two :)
Thank you!
"The Torus integration should not take more than 10-15 min of developer time, and they should sit in quite seamlessly in your application."
Hey guys why is the openlogin npm package not found?
thanks
is the documentation site open source?
Happy to help change it and PR
getting this error
got it thanks!
got it to work. Thanks for helping üòÇ
"oh yea btw, is there a documentation around how to customise a login modal?"
you can create your own modal using openlogin.
here is an example of a combo of openlogin passwordless and web3 modal.
with custom UI.
Default openlogin modal is not customizable yet but you can bypass it by creating your own onboarding screen and connecting it with openlogin sdk.
"yep, all of the modal functionality can be invoked via the SDK"

Will be solved?
Or when?
"hello, yes sure, we will look into this

let me inquire and get back to you"
Is any update?
"stay put, still looking into it"
Hi all - are there any more detailed guides that cover Auth0 / Torus integration? Specifically for Passwordless login
I think I'm good on the Torus side of things but there are a lot of settings on the Auth0 side and I haven't been able to get passwordless to work fully yet. I have gotten as far as getting the magic link email to send but then when I click the link the user is still asked to create an account.
even better if the user can just type in their email on our front end and get the email automatically
You can do this too
You can pass in login_hint with the email input from the user. You need to edit universal login in auth0 with custom design to make it work. We can schedule a call where I can help you with the changes required
"cool - I appreciate that! I've got the login_hint set up, but haven't looked into Universal login yet. I'll mess with that for a bit and let you know if / when I need to chat. Thank you!"
"hi there, had anybody succesfully integrated Torus with Biconomy to enable gasless transactions? Maybe I could have a peek at your code to see a full working example?"
We're pushing a new update. Apologies for the inconvenience. It should be fixed within the next 15 mins
"Thank you, I'll have a look! Maybe tomorrow, it's late here but I'm soooo close üòõ"
we do something a bit different though where we use a gnosis safe for each user
"Ok, can I ask why? I see that you use NFT, but that is also something Torus support if I remember correctly. Just curious"
you can either enable meta TXs in each contract you write or do a smart contract wallet that supports all contracts
"this lets us do things like interact on quickswap for the user, etc"
we're also on polygon so it's cheap
this also lets them swap out torus for a ledger or whatever in the future
no offsense torus team!) üôÇ
this is fixed now. You should be able to use the wallet normally
"Oh interesting, thanks! Just like you, we're building on Polygon and will offer Torus and probably also good old MetaMask. Btw, the project looks cool so I'll play around with it tomorrow and also check out the codebase."
"sweet - we're not completely OSS yet, but that kasumah repo is pretty much our entire TX infrastucture - if you're on ethersjs you might want to take a look - it's not well (ummm at all) documented yet though."
heyo - seems down again?
"we also had a user complain about a ""reset"" account meaning that torus probably returned a different address for them"
but I can't login at all
should be working? though sometimes it takes time to propergate

"Hello Torus team - was just messing around with OpenLogin. Seems to work great - very easy to integrate.
I'm just curious - at the moment, is it at all possible to modify the appearance of the login modal?"
that is coming next
soon(tm)
"actually today, you don't have to use the modal at all and can build the login modal yourself using the underlying API 

customization for the rest of the UI screens is the thing thats coming soon"
"ahh ok cool, nice to hear"
"so by the rest of the screens do you mean recovery email, etc?"
yeaps! the loader and the setup too
"nice - ok great - appreciate that, would definitely be interested to see the boilerplate - thanks!"

Anyone have any good ideas for sybil protection? We've been handing out free tokens to signups but now people figured that out and are automating so we've had to shut it down. I'd love to actually give tokens to folks though.
I was testing out BambooRelay as another website that uses Torus auth for mobile web but noticed it doesn't seem to work unless you enable cookies.
Any idea why that's required? We'd like to avoid that requirement for our website.
Are you saying it's down for you? Because I can just login to cryptogladiators
no no sorry - we had to turn off new user rewards because there were bots
you can still login - you were one of the last people to get $1k PTG
stupid bots tho)

hi - I'm trying to integrate Torus custom auth with Firebase auth and securely associate the user's Torus email with their Firebase account
"All login etc... is working, but I'm trying to figure out a way that I can verify that the email that gets sent to Firebase to login is indeed the same one associated with the Torus account they used to login"
is there a way I could check do something on the back end like checking a Torus key against an email or something?
also curious to know if Auth0 is the only option for passwordless login with Torus - given the number of users we're expecting it could be very expensive
"You can use AWS Cognito, Okta or firebase too for passwordless login."
for passwordless
"Yes you can.
Let me do a quick write up on how to check this"

Hello. My organization is using TorusWallet as a simple and straigtforward way of onboarding individuals into the Ethereum space without needing a in depth understanding of the way Ethereum wallets work. The OpenLogin update that took place a few days back is causing issues for our customers. Many of these individuals are retired and not very tech savvy so when they see touch id they are doing this without thinking twice. Meanwhile the wallet address changes and they are under the impression that their balances are 0. Is there a way to disable this option from popping up when using TorusWallet? OpenLogin seems like a very useful feature but it is causing confusion for our users in this case
You'll need a custom verifier... let me create a group
"You can pin the torus wallet to an older version. 

torus.init( })"
so hopefully you see less of a problem there

hey so I have another user that thinks their address changed from their torus wallet using gmail
they took a screenshot of their wallet and there was no tkey set - only the gmail on the accounts and that was set to default
default was gmail
"I asked if they thought they might have used ""sign in with email"" before and they said definitely not"
we do have some evidence that there was actually a change to their address (from an earlier conversation) but I'm unsure how to continue diagnosing
it's possible they didn't login for 2 months if that makes any difference... and we are still using a locked version of torus before openlogin
could you shooot them over

hello do you have bitcoin integration?
I am the Syscoin Core developer
and BCFN:CSE CTO
I would like to integrate Syscoin which is a Bitcoin fork
can you give me an estimate should you wish to do it what the cost of something like that would be? Its for one of our clients
we actually need our token platform layer which is based on UTXO assets to integrate as they are going to be a Syscoin token
lets hop on a call
actually before we do that.. they are actually on Matic and use Arcane API I dont know if you know that one
but very similar social login.. one of the reasons they like that one is the pay to email functionality..
you guys can offer such a feature?
so yes on some of our setups
its a bit nuanced
I dont know the security details how they keep it secure.. because that sounds scary to me without a custodial seed they store or some 2fa strategy.. where trust is on the 2fa then.. but they like the convenience
"then on top of that.. these Arcane guys actually have a simple service where if you dump them a CSV of email addresses and amounts, send them the assets they can distribute it via email in CSV .. I know it sounds rudementary but these are the main reasons they stay loyal to this brand"
so if you can keep that in mind as we chat would be great

Firstly, congrats on a great project, seems like really needed thing for blockchain/crypto mass adoption

So my technical question might be silly. I'm looking to integrate your solution with another chain with pretty much basic auth - public token, private token & seed phrase. 
So it's not very clear for me from your docs how user should sign up/register, providing these tokens and connect it to torus for further sign in/login. Looking for any help on that, thx"

which means I can manage key generation?

"We have a list of supported chains when you navigate to settings>network>select network on our wallet

We support Ethereum mainnet, BSC, Xdai, Matic among others 

(Developers on the other hand are able to use customAuth for integrating with any blockchain of their choice)"
so customAuth is the only option then
What exactly are you looking for?
I'm familiar with zillet. But to my understanding users can't buy within the wallet like they can on torus
most our users are/will not be big crypto folks
"However, with regards to the FIAT On-ramps, you might need to find a partner that offers ZIL to integrate."
Is this the place to ask for help?
you can add custom network from network section under settings tab as decribed by documentation link you have shared above.

Hey so what is this group about
Heys were you able to log into your Torus Wallet?
"Yes, I can log in"
Where are you connecting from?
And are you using an adblocker or vpn?
I'm using VPN.
Is there a way to test against Rinkeby or Ropsten nets? I guess I'm just confused how your testnet interacts with other testnets out there
"Our testnet is used only for DKG. It's interaction with other testnets shouldn't affect you in any way. 

You are free to test your Dapp in any testnet you'd like!"
Which service of Torus are you interested in?
"We are looking at using CustomAuth. So right now on ethereum and their testnets, I have the same Public address across mainnet as well as all the testnets. Should that be the case with torus as well?"
"No. You'll have to use different verifiers for Torus testnet and mainnet. So, the public address will be different"
"No, it will be different in this scenario as well!"
"Ahhh interesting. So, if we went down this path, we'd have to build out an entire UI for the wallet presentation as well. Interesting. CustomAuth may not be what we want then... hmm"
"If you use openlogin, you get an app scoped key which is different from the torus wallet key."
"What's the product that you're developing.? Maybe I can help more in that case..
Are you looking for interoperability between dapps.?"
"Yes, we are trying to make it incredibly easy for users to get into crypto via our Dapp, but we want them to be able to easily move to other Dapps without the need of transferring funds, importing wallets, etc.  We want them to just login via Torus on other sites using the same provider they did on our dapp..

We want our user's wallets to be interoperable with other marketplaces and dapps, but like the security and customiability that OpenLogin and CustomAuth provide"
"With regards to customizability, what kind of customizations are you looking at?"

"Hello, what do you mean by restrict all addresses?"
Are you looking to whitelist addresses that come to your site first before they can log into Torus?
Hello Torus team. We want to implement Custom Auth with the same verifier ID described below for getting the same private key from users who register with the same email but with different login throw a social network. But Torus registration verifier does not allow that. Any idea what I do wrong? Very appreciated.
"Hey, the dashboard currently doesn't support aggregate verifiers. We can set up a group and deploy the verifier for you manually."
"Yes, I done that.

when creating a TORUS verifier for Apple
"Hey, it's the auth0 domain!"
Thank you K - So I need to create an auth0 account to have the Login w Apple feature?
This is interesting - Why do some logins require an Auth0 domain? (Google does not for example)
"Auth0 makes it very easy to integrate certain verifiers ( twitter onwards in the developer dashboard list ). So, we've kept it as the default option"
"But, you are free to choose any login providers as long as it follows the JWT spec. We call it custom verifier"
Thank you K - do you know if there is some kind of documentation on how to create a torus verifier along with auth0 setup?
"For Google, facebook, reddit and discord; we interact directly with their servers to verify the auth tokens. So, they are separated from JWT verifiers"
Got you!
"Last question - when we get a verifier wrong in the Torus dashboard, we can‚Äôt delete it? üò¨"
No. It will be stored on an Ethereum contract!
"But, it is possible to edit it. Just not it's name and type!"
Yes and not the proxy domain as well)
You can edit the proxy domain!

not sure am I missing something to open up in popup
"it does try to open in a popup.

Macs disallow opening popups when full screen.. so it opens as a tab. It's a default behavior. It works normally it you aren't full screen

not sure what format youre refering to being the jwk
if what youre talking about is formats

or alternatively use OpenLogin or customauth with tkey for the threshold redundency featuers

3. Can anyome can send me a link to see how i can connect my App with google facebook, reddit or twitter account using DirectAuth ?"
Thanks in advance
It can!
"You can use it as a seed to BIP44 it has, slightly less but still more than plenty enough entropy"
I see that‚Äôs very interesting thank you
"I noticed your wallet implementations uses the same private key and wallet address for BNB, ETH, DAI, etc."
"Does it mean, that in theory, that private key could be used across all blockchains?"
"All those chains use the same secp256k1 curve, thus same key (same as bitcoin too) format that we give back"
You can use the key as a seed tho
"To derive keys for other elliptic curve types, and we provide those libraries"
Take a look at our solana boiler plate
"Nope, we don't charge any fees actually"

"Got you, ok - so out of curiosity, let‚Äôs say for example, one would want to get a Cardano PK from a OpenLogin PK. As Cardano is using Ed-25519-extended, one would have to create a similar bridge as the one above specifically for Ed-25519-extended?"
guys any idea why this happens when trying to login with reddit? (I'm using torus-embed)
"Nvm it was a noob thing, I figured I was missing the client_id under jwtParameters. Sorry for bothering!"
The repo is public now. the link would work
"Thank you Chaitanya - if I build a util that uses the Torus private key as a seed for an HD wallet, is that of interest to you? Should I give it a crack in that repo?"
Yes. That would be great

you can just left pad it!
Ok super useful - thank you for clarifying this

Can the threshold on the Tkey library be set or is it always deterministic based on the amount of total shares? i.e If I have 5 shares can I set 2/3/4 as being the threshold required for regenerating the key?
I assume its based on the degree of the polynomial but its all a bit beyond me unfortunately. :)
"if you use the tkey library directly, you can set it to 3/4 and so on

if you're using our products like OpenLogin or Torus Wallet (which use tkey), it's set to 2/3 because user flows beyond 3/4 aren't that intuitive, but we're working on adding it"
"so yes, you can use a higher threshold if you want!"
Am using the library directly. Unfortunately the current state of documentation leaves a lot to be desired but assuming you guys are still working on it. It's fantastic by the way! Any hints on where I can set this? Is it part of initializing a new key or can it be set after?
I'm fairly sure this is the future of wallets so I wanted to dev early.
Thank you very much!

"Good morning everyone, I hope my message finds you well. I have one question for the benefits of paid torus packages. We are interested in fully customize torus to fit our website needs. Can we achieve that with the paid packages (developer/pro)? Are these options providing us with the capability to fully control torus iframe and integrate it in our website according to our needs? This include styling, full control of iframe css,etc.. Thank you for your time !"
"Hey Paris, yes we have one standard pricing across all our products. You would be able to whitelabel your Torus integration"
"Hi Elisha and thanks for your answer. So this basically means that we can fully customise torus in any way we want? That means placing the iframe inside our page and have full control over it, change iframe children css, create custom torus button, etc?"
"Yeap, ideally, if you‚Äôre looking for more control over the UI, you might want to take a look a CustomAuth instead"
Happy to hop on a call to walk you through our products
"sorry it‚Äôs not English but basically what it‚Äôs trying to say is torus popup is blocked by Anti virus web shield like Avast.
it‚Äôs regarded as phishing site. 

is there any workaround for that ?"

"Apple login doesn't provide email of the user always. it's not really recommended to auto associate using aggregate verifiers in such cases.
You can use a proxy such as Cognito/Auth0 etc.. and configure the account linking there"
what logins do you want to aggregate.?
thanks for response. ‚Äúlogin again through torus wallet‚Äù meaning we can‚Äôt interact directly with getTorusKey and provide to wallet? we instead need to use full customauth wherein they login through embed?
"what's your usecase for a wallet?
CustomAuth gives you the required private key right.?!"
ya it‚Äôs not required but would be a simplifier i think. looking to integrate with 3id dids
"we can sign of course but i imagined the ceramic library interfaces with an eth compatible wallet. presume there‚Äôs a standard, interop spec."
if i have the spec i could but figured i‚Äôd check if it were easy to just use torus wallet first
"I‚Äôm interested in solution 3, how would I do that?"
"A handful of the common ones. Google, Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, discord. I think all of which have an email, which sounds like the important key to aggregating them"
"We are about to add the documentation for this.
 
There‚Äôre limitations to which verfiers you can combine. You can combine multiple google verifers, but not apple verifiers (because of the privacy layer). 

You can also explore auth0 to combine verifiers."
we will add the documentation soon
"Not really. You should use OpenLogin directly if you want your users to have the recovery benefits.

Alternatively, users should also setup 2fa with the OAuth providers"
"This is the reason I am asking about identity aggregators. I need to use CustomAuth but also want to provide recovery. I am assuming if I can aggregate Torus logins then this will provide users with a similar recovery experience. For example, if I can aggregate google and Twitter and Reddit and if the user loses access to one of those logins, then they can still get their private key through another one 

Is the above scenario accurate?"
That works
"cool! that's great to hear. So last I saw, Torus team is adding documentation on how to add validator aggregation, right? That's not something I can do yet?"
"Never found a solution for this. The Torus code injects the Torus iframe into the DOM using Window.postMessage I think. However, iframes have their own DOM, so that Torus iframe gets injected into any iframe on the page, as well as the main DOM"
is the binance extension using openlogin or customauth?
The base under openlogin which includes CustomAuth
"would this or customAuth be the best solution for me.
i'm also building an extension.

I was trying to use openlogin but the google window doesn't popup (it does on a react web app, same code)."
"Openlogin definitely works best on web based apps, i think for chrome extensions customauth is probably the easiest way to start

we'd be happy to support/accomdate features that help you with the endeavour
"right now yeah, the keys/sub HD keys are constructed and plugged in. are you talking about
1) the wallet web3 style where a provider is used? the torus wallet currently doesnt support solana just yet (its in the works).
2) or the TSS/MPC, style where the key isnt reconstructed? this also not in production yet"
"Ah yeah, I was thinking of 1) but that makes sense."
"openlogin should work quite well at this point! users use the same account, each application gets a HD key"
will keep you updated with torus-wallet for solana

should I be able to use TorusDirectSdk via nodejs using require?
"no, it relies on browser capabilities so will not work on backend and it is also not meant to be used on backend."

Is there some rate limiting to that or any limitations I should be aware of? Like if I wanted to calculate hundreds of addresses in a short time span?"
Yes. We do have rate limits. It's for new key generation. It's around 2-3/s

We see a Proxy object returned, with a null value for selectedAddress, but when inspecting the target, selectedAddress is provided and the expected address. I've added a screenshot to clarify. 

The question: how can we get the selectedAddress from the returned provider? By the way, this behavior is found when connecting to Torus, but not when connecting to MetaMask."

"Hello there, I am setting up Auth0 passwordless with flutter and I am getting the following error:

I think you are passing incorrect verifier_id value while fetching torus key.
Value of your verifier_id param should be the value of field which you defined as jwt verifier id while creating verifier.
"it is in wei units, simply convert it to ether using web3 utils"
"const etherValue = Web3.utils.fromWei(WEI_VALUE, 'ether')"

how to bind any data to the torus when you went through google and get it back (in the terra context)
It's up to the dapp developer to store the data & reuse it in case of CustomAuth
"_initializeNewKey() is an internal method (use only if you know what you are doing)

The error means that you don‚Äôt have enough shares to reconstruct the key. After you call .initialize(), you will get 2 shares in the response."
"Hi everyone, I had a very basic doubt regarding Torus Custom Auth.

Torus Custom auth says full control over UI. What exactly does that mean? Because let's say we're logging in using Google, then the login page will be served by google only, and we don't have any control. 

Sorry if it's a very basic question üòÖ"
"It means that you can control your login screen ui, in case of google you can control ui of google login button. You may also want to accomodate multiple login methods like passwordless , facebook etc in your login screen. Meaning You can built and control fully customised ui of your login screen accomodating all custom auth supported login methods of your choice similar to web2 apps."

"Hi, is there an easy way to retreive a new token from auth0, i'm not getting the data needed to get a new one when logging in with Torus.."
Or maybe a silent re-login / re-authenticate function for the torus customauth api
"Or do i need to also use the auth0 package to double login or something, it's getting pretty frustrating"
"Hello everyone :) 

I have a theoretical question about torus direct sdk:

It uses open id to login user by Google or Auth0. And success result from torus contains jwt access token from these services. 

Live time of this jwt token from Google or Auth0 is about 1 hour. 

But open id additionally has a refresh token mechanism. 

Does torus direct sdk support this refresh token mechanism? 
Or may be it will be supported in future plans?"
how can buy Torus?
Torus sdk doesn't support refresh tokens. You can query with the OAuth provider and get refresh tokens directly. Torus sdk requires you to use a new token in each call.
"Got it üëç
Thank you for response!"
It is saying that the user failed to verify him/herself
Aka the token is invalid or has a different verifierId with provided verifier id value
Thanks for this help! üëç
If you need any help I just finished the implementation that you are referring to with auth0
Hello! Are you able to buy crypto with a credit or debit card on Torus?

"hello, had a quick question -- we're using triggerLogin and noticing a lot of jrpc calls to various chains other than just ethereum (cosmos, binance etc etc)

this process seems to take 10-30 seconds for new users to login

is getTorusKey sufficient? how do we avoid all of the calls to the other chains?"
Those aren't other chains. They are torus node providers.

"Hey team! I have a customauth verifier and I run my own OAuth2 provider. I was wondering a few things: 

1. Will I be able to let my users change their password without them having to change to a different private key? 

2. Will I be able to rotate the keys I used for encryption? Since I guess that will result in a different JWT signature.."
I've updated the validations. You should be able to create it now. Thank you for reporting the issue!
"1. Yes
2. Preferably not if you use the key in raw. But it's possible to use a defined endpoint instead of a key, and in that case you can rotate as much as you want"
You should use same verifier id field value which you specified while creating custom verifier.
I guess you are passing email in getToruskey and you have used ‚Äúsub‚Äù field while creating verifier or may be vice versa.
Make sure you use same fields at both places.
Could you share the console logs?

Facebook doesn't allow redirecting to localhost. Just add a https localhost in Facebook settings and manually edit it while testing

on the facebook dev dashboard
you have to set your redirect url
set that to localhost while in dev and your domain vice versa in prod

I'm trying to replace firebase in my app with torus to auth to solana wallets. It looks like this is possible. I was wondering if this supports cdn instead of npm?
"So basically adding in <script type=""module""> instead of just starting with import."
looks like that was my answer
"looks to have a jsdelivr, thanks for building that guys."
Hi! We currently have a custom Torus verifier set up for our custom authorization provider but we might move to Auth0. Is there a way to migrate to Auth0 while distributing the same private keys for existing users?
So I'm trying to connect Solana via cdn for auth. It looks like the docs are written for npm. Any of the team online to help maybe?
Will that work with Solana or say a sollet wallet extension?
"checking it out now, I was mainly using this guide and for cdn it was confusing me"
"Yes, custom auth is designed to work with any blockchain"
So this works based on class rather than ID?>
Can you send me a dm so I put you in touch with our devs?
"hey there, ah potentially"
can you pm me your verfierID
"So question. I was able to auth with google via the OpenLogin in my app, but it's not placed a user with a key for me to see like it typically would in Firebase. Am I missing something or does this not allow the dev to see a list of users and uid's?"
Does custom auth need to relate back to a firestore like environment outside of torus or do you guys managed an internal key database we see with custom auth?
"it depends on the method of authentication youre using, but generally on our side you can see user count and MAUs and you'd use the google/apple/firestore dashboard for the rest"
gotcha. So Torus integration is more of just handling the signing from the wallet and everything else needs to go to firestore or something.
Sorry I'm somewhat new to dev work.
hey no worries

"I'm testing OpenLogin on mobile, and I'm curious where I can find more documentation about this 2FA."
"My understanding is OpenLogin (like other Torus products) requires 2/3 shares to authenticate, where the shares are 1) device, 2) social, 3) security question."
"But this 2FA flow is asking me to ""Use the current browser to approve access from new devices/browsers."" Does that mean it wants to store a share on 1)? Since 2FA is not enabled currently, where are the other shares being stored?"
Thanks.
Or does it mean I just haven't finished setting up the 2/3 shares on that OpenLogin account?
"If so, I'm not sure why I'm allowed to select ""maybe next time"" if I don't have 2+ shares..."
"What you're seeing on the beta site is our latest updated flow for OpenLogin that focuses on a initial 2/2 flow with the end user instead of 2/3. The aim here is to get a seamless onboarding with solely OAuth that users in our UX tests have been asking for. The second share in this case is a revokable and very redundant share stored on the device + made more redudant with us, torus via IPaddress and more traditional identification techniques."
Applications can still prompt a default 2/3 flow for your users through the API if you wish
If you're looking for docs
Thank you for the response!
"just to clarify, is this second ""on device"" share just a temporary one that is replaced when the user clicks ""Set up 2FA"" with their device?"
"which is a more permanent, long-term, secure share?"
I took a look at this but didnt see any information about this new 2/2 flow
I'm wondering what the best way to explain this to users is haha
Hi i do torus wallet have wordpress plugin?
"Is there a way of getting the correct key for a token?‚Ä¶ instead of ETH. I‚Äôm trying to send XLM from my Coinbase, but I can only find my ETH address"
"It's a new flow, so docs are still being worked on"
Sorry for the lack of clarity here
"Yes, local storage isn't as permanent a store as preferred in a 2/2. So the share is given extra redundancy through our servers that return it on traditional auth checks"
When you setup the 2fa or 2/3 you then see the share on device + with ever chosen backup method
There is one but it's a tad outdated at this point
is the on-device share for 2fa also backed up on your servers?
"in both 2/2 or 2/3, isnt the key share stored the same way, i.e. locally on the device"

So you supply the new token to getTorusKey each time user login your game? This is another possible way to di it
"Can you provide more details on this one? Like which verifier you use, what token did you guve. One of the reasons to these kind of problems could be that the our nodes has already seen this token, hence rejecting a duplicated token. But there are many other reasons for this to happen as well."

"why you simply don't pack the website into an app and add support for walletconnect on mobile so apps could login using Torus on mobile, that would be very nice."
Wallet connect works on mobile browser
"you can do this by logging in on mobile, theres a wallet connect scanner"
"Hmm, I will try it, üôè"
"Hello Group. Is it possible now or it could be possible in the future transfer the credentials from one user to another, with his permission, obviously"
It's technically feasible for sure in the future
We're working on a social recovery flow that's not exactly the same but similar
Thank you!
Are we expecting any governence token by Torus
What does that mean?
related to that: I don't see any API method in CustomAuth for _creating_ a Torus account for a user. How is that done?
I will dm you to help resolving this error.
Accounts are automatically created with getTorusKey function for new users.
"Alternatively, we could make one request to our server which generates the JWT and then makes the call to torusSdk.getTorusKey() on the server side, and then sends the keys to the client."
The downside is that the user's key is now exposed to the server
"That's true, and you think that's still a concern even if we're not persisting it on the server?"
"It would be a concern for me as a user, since it is nearly impossible for me to determine that it is not being persisted/intercepted somewhere. Much safer to have the key reconstructed only client side."
"fair points, we'll stick to client-side reconstruction"
"Is there a fix for this issue in the latest release? ```Brendan Wanlass, Nov 1, 2021 at 9:51:16 AM:\n...',  , '\n\n',  , '```'"
Yes. pls update
I can‚Äôt log in. Trying to get on the phone with a human. ASAP please.
the latest for android sdk is 1.5.1
Can I update that independently of the flutter sdk?
pls update to the latest flutter sdk v2.1.0. We'll also be releasing newer versions by friday
The issue seems to be that the BuildConfig.class included in the flutter SDK is in the wrong package.
Thanks üëç
Seeing this error on our staging environment site on mobile web only when the browser redirects to the testing (beta) Open Login site. Everything works as expected on desktop web
Could I get some help on this? Thanks!
Which platform is this?
Also what params was passed to the openlogin sdk?üßê
This is using React and Next.js on Firebase Cloud Functions
This is all we pass to the SDK
When we login
Ok let me have a look
Did this work previously or have never worked?
It's never worked. I just deployed today to test on mobile web
It doesn't work on either mobile Safari or Brave
Can you give me or pm me the staging link so I can experience that myself?
I‚Äôll DM you
Hi plz update to latest version
"Upgraded, but still seeing the issue"
Did you whitlisted your domain on developer dashboard ?
"I don't have access to the dashboard, but I don't believe we have. Let me contact the developer that does and I'll get back to you. Thanks!"
It‚Äôs strange that you don‚Äôt need to whitelist for desktop web but you do for mobile web‚Ä¶
You need to whitelist for both unless you are using localhost.
I was able to login properly on desktop web without whitelisting
"But now that I whitelisted the domain, it works now"
Thank you Himanshu!
"hey all ! i'm researching a torus ios sdk. are there any released applications to appstore ? if yes, could you provide links to their ? i want to check the authorization flow on the ios apps. thanks !"
oh great thanks !
is there a cost associated with deploying a verifier to mainnet?
hi here
is Torus compatible with addresses on fantom network?
Thanks
"While testing with Facebook and email login password less

Does it auto create that
"hey guys! we're using Torus to authenticate people with twitter through our app, there is an edge case where sometimes a login attempt fails but I don't think our app is responding to it correctly.

"hello, I am neeraj. my Torus openlogin not working. Even I don't get any error in console.

Which version and sdk are you using ?
Also share a minimal code snippet to reproduce. Thanks

phle mera code chl rha tha
but ab ni chl rha
samj ni aa rha kya dikkat aa rhi
"Okay no worries, i will DM you to help"
ok thanku
"any help from my message the other day, guys?"
"Hi here,
the torus customAuth seem to be implemented from the frontend (react/vue) alone"
can anyone point me to using it with a node backend?
"customauth isnt designed to run server side, because thats custodial"
"Repost: hey guys! we're using Torus to authenticate people with twitter through our app, there is an edge case where sometimes a login attempt fails but I don't think our app is responding to it correctly.

is there a way for me to emulate a login failure so I can replicate the scenario?"
which sdk is this.?
torus-direct-web-sdk: 4.2.0
Was wondering whether there was a param or something simple that can be passed to force the auth failure response
"Hello, 

Ropsten seems to be congested at the moment, cause of which new customauth verifier deployments on our testnet is being delayed. 
Thank you for your patience and we will keep you posted!"
"UPDATE: We've fixed the underlying issue, and all new testnet customauth verifiers will be processed now"

"Hi All,
We were trying to integrate Torus cust auth in to our application. 
We are using IdentityServer4 as our Auth provider. But the token generated by IdentityServer4 is not showing the ""iat"" claim because of which the Torus integration is not working.
Has anyone worked before with IdentityServer4 and faced any similar issue?
Any help is much appreciated."
Rfc for jwt suggests that iat is necessary. Can you add that claim.?
We had tried to add it explicitly but still it didn't appear in the token.
"really odd, and not conventional for the spec"
whats the unique identifier field you have instead of iat
"instead of iat, there is auth_time which shows the time at which the token was issued"
ah hmmm
"unfortuately the nodes depend on iat, can't change that at the moment"
OK. Thanks for the info. Meanwhile we are also planning to use a different Auth Provider. Can you suggest some which has worked for you?
Cognito
Ok. Thanks for your help.
Has anyone else been having issues with the stability of Open Login in production?
"Today I've been experiencting it fail silently with the following message ""already initialized, removing previous modal iframe"""
and the login workflow simply doesn't start
sdk-modal relies on some state which is passed from openloginSdk in url. Can you share some code snippet of your openlogin integration part.
Hi can you share some steps to reproduce this issue. Is it happening frequently for you ?
"We're both working on the same project, so these issues are related"
"For context, we're using Web3React, and implemented a custom provider"
"is this code public, can you share your branch on web3React?"
It's not public
But I can share the code with your privately in a Gist
"that would be nice, i will DM you."
also plz update to 1.3.2
"Sure, let me do that first"
"Thanks for the quick response, updating the version fixed the issue"
awesome
I do find it problematic though that there's a lack of backwards compatibility from older package versions
We're actively working to improve stability of openlogin. Apologies for the inconvenience. Third party cookie support is the reason there was a problem with backward compatibility.
"Hi All,

When calling the getTorusKey function, we are getting below error
""Error: data ethAddress does not match response address""
We are using the CustomAuth Verifier.
Anyone knows what this error means?"
Which sdk is this!?
TorusSdk
"Is this Android, iOS , web, react native or flutter?"
I am trying to call the getTorusKey function from the Login function of the sample code with the JWT token received from our Auth Server
"I guess you are connected on support chat regarding this issue, i just looked at the your code snippet and jwt token: use this: ',  ,\nYOUR_JWT_TOKEN); ', 'language': ''}, '\ninstead of: \n\n',  ,\n"""");', 'language': ''}, '\nnotice ""email"" is replaced with ""',  , '"" and you need to pass your jwt token'"
Do I need to give the email id at both places?
Thanks for your assistance. It workedüëç
"so in a case where I want to save my user details to a database, how does it work if its not designed to run server side"
can someone possibly clarfy this for me
"My abstract: User password should be hashed when stored in db, so it‚Äôs value only known to the user. An authentication token should derive from a successful signin and is used together with your jwks endpoint to request your private key from Torus. Not the user details itself."
But correct me where I‚Äôm wrong please
"i see your point here,only thing is if a user wants to sign in with oauth, they will not need a password
but I understand, I can request something to be sent from the client during authentication, this is what i'll verify on the server"
After a successfull signin you generally receive a user identitifier and an access token when redirected to your client app.
"In my case I pass the ',  , ' and ',  , ' I obtain from my own authorization provider in the ',  , ' method and get a private key in return'"
hi there could anyone help me to implement identity verification functionality also into my site where i have also used openlogin. is there any thing that needs to be enabled to get that feature (Identity verification).
i will be very thankful to you.
thank you very much himanshu.
himanshu i found this page there did you mean enable 2FA?
i see there is no webauthn enabling options can you help me?
can anyone just guide me?
Enable 2fa and thn you should get option to enable webauthn on the same page.
thank again himanshu!
Himanhu i got this page after enable 2fa. and found nothing like webauthn enabling function. i just want to integrate identity varification feature enable for all the users who will come to my site and try to login through torus openlogin. is it possible!
"It is integrated by default, however currently as a developer you cannot ask user to enable it. The process remains same for every user (i.e) they need to enable it from accounts page."
i have do this also and nothing heppend by making fastlogin true
This option is useful only if webauthn is enabled by user.
so is there no any automatic way
"Not as of now, it is in our development pipeline"
ok thanks hianshu for helping
"Hello everyone, I want to display the login form as page instead of popup. I tried the following code but it stills opens as a pop up. Any ideas?"
"async function login() {
      const   = await openlogin.login({
    BaseLoginOptions: {
      display: ""page"",
    }
});"
Hey in the constructor pass uxMode:  ‚Äúredirect‚Äù
Thank you Himanshu
it actually is uxMode: redirect
"window.openlogin = new Openlogin.default({
        clientId: ""...."",
        network: ""testnet"",
        redirectUrl: ""..."",
        uxMode: ""redirect"",
   
      });"
I just removed id and url for readibility
Is it still showing you popup?
Ohh... i will check and get back to u
Thank you
"Also, one quick question: Can I add logo to the login form? It can be popup or page. no any extra styling, just adding the logo. Is it possible? Thank you so much."
"fyi... if you use the Android SDK, note that there was a breaking change recently"
"they upgraded to Android 12, which completely broke my (react native) mobile app"
"just make sure you explicitly pin the maven dep in your build.gradle like this:

dependencies {
  ...
  implementation 'com.github.torusresearch:openlogin-android-sdk:56a987b9c8'
}"
if you want to continue using older versions of Android
Any updates Himanshu? Thank you.
"Hi, i checked it , it is working perfectly as intended. Setting uxMode as ""redirect"" will open oauth provider (ex: google) login page on same tab rather than a window popup. is it something you want to do?"
"currently you cannot add logo in openlogin modal, however in openlogin you can build you own UI and connect it with login functions from openloginSdk"
I am working on a simple Web/HTML integration.
Wordpress User system. Thanks
"okay thanks for reporting this, i will check and get back to u. Which login method are using ? (Google, facebook etc)"
Google
"Hi team, do you have plans to integrate your wallet with other projects so your users can interact with the wider DeFi space directly via Torus? Such as Ledger Live, imToken Dapp browser, MEW Explore etc..."

Does anyone have encountered this problem ?

Is this related to enabling touch and face id option at this this page? Thank you
It means that your account currently has 4 security factors enabled and you need atleast 2 of them to login in to your account
Does your device has touch id or face id ?
"Yes it has touch Face ID and we need it to prompt like below, we saw this on another app using open login this is aloud last step and everything else is working perfectly"
Below is an app where it is enabled and we want to show it as the top option instead of the bottom options so position 1 instead of position 3

Any chance u can run the build in xcode? It produce much better build errors
Any professional devs
Please dm i have to create a complicated smartcontract on solidity
Please dm if you are an expert
This is the error
Can you select an ios version > 12 in ur xcode?
Can anyone help me with this?
"I believe i am running on ios 15 , but this is an error"
You have to set the ios deploykent target in your xcode build target
"I think i am running on ios 15 but, as shown in the above image"
"Can you verify that your deployment target in ur xcode target is correct? Your simulator/os version does not matter here, it is talking about which version of ios sdk are u building for"
please verify that u have the correct ios version in these 3 places
Anyone here use Torus/Web3Auth with web3-react? Their docs are terrible and I can't figure out how to pass arguments to Torus/Web3Auth when instantiating
Did u run pod install after changing the version things in the podfile?
"Yes done everything possible, pod update / install."
Strange
Let's have a call at like mon or Tues and i can help u debugging that
"Sure, thanks a lot buddy üôèüèª"
We want the flexibility to work with injected providers and Gnosis Safe and whatnot - I don‚Äôt think Web3Auth supports that?
Hello Developers üôÇ
Popup is stuck on this path domain/servicesworker/redirect. Any idea how to fix it?
Using custom-auth btw.
"What‚Äôs up! I‚Äôm looking for a WEB3 Developer to create a script that is no harder than a timed liquidity lock.

Lets connect today at 9am utc ?
Guys ?
For your case it should be a variable like kotlinVersion
I guess this time is already passed right?
"How about tmr? I am in gmt+8, where u are?ü§î"
Gmt + 5
Today if possible please. I can be available at any time convenient to you.
"Let say 2000 for gmt +8, looks good? Which is 1500 for you"
"Sure, looks good to me. Please share your mail, will organize a gmeet"
Pmed you
Yes.. let's connect..
Tomorrow would work better as I am still working on the react native side of this sdk
The problem I am guessing is old gradle version. Update the project gradle to latest and see if this resolves the issue
We will need to publish the updated react native sdk with docs... the current implementation won't work
hey all - I've noticed that some of my older verifiers don't seem to appear in my dasboard (although they seem to work fine) - any way I can get those to appear? thanks
as long as the JWK endpoint isnt affected it should be fine!
will do - thanks again
we will do this
Yes... send me the join link

"How can someone buy MATIC tokens on the Polygon network, not the Ethereum network, to have in their Torus wallet.

Gotcha!
"Hi team, Torus open login works great but I tested it on Device 1, and using Google SSO, it logs me into dApp website. By disconnecting Device 1 from internet, I logged into the dApp website from a new device Device 2. I thought Torus required 2/3 quorum and not just a SSO?"
"On Device 2, I only ever had to satisfy Google SSO challenge. What am I missing?"
"so in the 2/2 setup at the very beginning, as its more likely a user would lose their device/share on the setup without a backup, we optimize on redundancy.

 we use common identifiers + social login verification (i.e. vicinity IP address etc.) in addition to the device share for extra redundancy and a smooth initial experience across devices"
if you login 3 or so times
or as an application toggle the 2/3 setup initially on the API
it'll trigger the setup/onboarding and you can see the inbetween device flow
"I see! So for the initial few logins, am I right in understanding that the wallet private key re-generation and signing is purely Social SSO challenge based?"
"its not purely SSO based, but SSO is a big part"
so kinda

Thank you for the update
I will ping u to help
I am using next js which does server side rendering
I just imported ur module and its giving this error
"hey, i just joined precisely to ask about that same issue. I've tried every way to ensure that when calling 'new Web3Auth()' it's done client side and it still doesn't work."
weird thing is that when running it inside a useEffect hook and making sure that typeof window is not undefined other code that access 'window' in the same hook does run but 'new Web3Auth()' still triggers the error.
"use dynamic imports in next, i had same issue"
"will look into that thanks,"

Hi guys is there any way for me to write a custom client with your oauth flow? I need web3Auth support in Unity app and probably have to make custom requests to your sdk url and parse the claims returned. I'm interested if there's some references of how your sdk url works and what kind of data it returns after successful authentication redirect link. also in what format are private keys returned for me to be able to sign transactions.
I'm not really sure if I'm explaining this clearly but would really appreciate some help :D. if anybody will be able to help me I can provide more details of what I need.
one idea I have is to look through the android sdk code and try to reconstruct the same functionality in unity
"Do you have any example or guide on how to create a verifier? Our objective is to validate a login made from torus in a Vue environment, where we need to validate on our backend through the torus public key, and extract it's user ID (email).

Any help here pls? Tks
best to work off this
Wow It seems like I missed this repo. Will look into it thanks üôè
Also do you guys know if Skyweaver game is made with unity?
getUserInfo method should return you the info
It returns everything except the handle? I think there's a specific scope that you need to pass in order to get the handle. Any clue?

their own engine

"HelloÔºåI integrated customauth-swift-sdk and created create verifier, setting up OAuth 2.0, created IOS OAuth client ID, and filled in the ClientID in the IOS project, but Google reported an error and failed to authorize."
"Guys, I have a question. I If I use Web3Auth to develop the DApp, once the end user login my DApp through their email account, is a Torus wallet be created and bundled with this email account automatically? Thanks"
Where is the Google API console browserredirecturl? I can't find it. Do you have any documents
When you create the web3auth clientId you need to register a clientid given by google right? You need to register the https started browserRedirectURL in your google api console
I can't find the location of setting the browserredirect URL in google api console. There is no such option
"What i meant is that you should set the redirecturl in the google api console as the https scheme browserRedirectURL you provided in the torus sdk, instead of the custom scheme redirect url"
Where to set up in Google API console
"I created OAuth client ID according to the document, but I can't find the redirect URL you said to modify in Google API console"
I guess you should create a new clientid for the web application instead
"Thanks mate, my next question is how I can read end user wallet account information (eg: token balance, etc.) after they sign in? Should I look for ""Provider"" or ""OpenLogin"" section inside the documentation? Thanks"
Hello! Friends! does web3auth not support evm-compatible chains other than those specified in Docs such as binance and ethereum?

"Hi guys, I'm integrating a Plug&Play module. While trying to login it fails, and the console says I need to whitelist my domain. How do I whitelist it?"
Do we have a chat setup with you.?
Hey looking into using torus/web3auth and have some questions regarding security. It seems like if someone were to intercept an OAuth access token or a user's JWT then they'd be able access a user's private key. I'm sure you have it figured out but I'm trying to wrap my head around it
Yes and they told me to come  here
"Although it looks like I've lost my chatbox now too and I can't get it back (clicking on ""support"" doesn't do anything on the UI, and console reports that the websocket to ...crisp.chat closed before connection established"

Dear Torus/web3auth team,
We consider your products and would like to know for which products/features we will be locked-in to using it (""vendor lock-in"").

Will it be possible to migrate a Web3Auth userbase to something else (e.g. self-hosted) ?
Is it possible to use the open source components of torus/openlogin without buying web3auth product? (also for > 1000 MAU) ?"
yeah but I dug through the code and it looks like in most places it's only the OAuth that's used to generate their key
"at the start, where its a 2/2 the device share is made super redundant with the OAuth + ipaddress, and regional identification as at this point its more likely a user would lose a key due to device loss than anything"
"after they login 3 or so times, or do a top up, or dapps indicating more value on their account, they're prompted with the 2/3 2fa setup"
bump this
Yes this is correct - Torus wouldn't want to expose a user's private key to a malicious app using openLogin - basically each app gets its own keypair
"got it. but the private key is stable as long as you're using the same client ID ? it seems like the client ID becomes as sensitive as a private key then, right? there's no other authentication to get access"
"i guess a user still has to auth, so a  malicious app would have to get a user to auth (eg google auth or whatever) using the client ID and then it could get the private key. is that right?"
"yeah, so in the event of using oauth, the malicious app would also need to somehow land up on the allowed list of oauth urls before having any access to the oauth token and consequently private key."
"oh right, the redirect is limited to whitelist, is that what yhou're getting at ?"
yup exactly that...
and is the private key stable for the lifetime of a client ID? eg as long as i don't change client ID my users will have the same private key?
yes the private key is stable for the same credential (google ID + Torus client Id)
"cool. and if the startup dies, does the user have a way to access it?"
or is that something we'd have to solve
"i.e. if Torus disappears tomorrow? The torus network nodes are run by some of the biggest names in the web3 business, so it is quite unlikely that there would not be enough nodes in the network to retrieve a user's keys"
i mean if my startup dies
ahhh I see... the user would still be able to reconstruct their key by presenting a valid credential to the torus network
if the oauth app were deleted from google for example then this would definitely cause users keys to become irreecoverable
Looking for web3developer
I want to build a P2E game for web3 version because of security
Please I need the contribution of someone with experience
would they be able to reconstruct their key without the client-id being present ? how does that work
"Should I hire a unity game developer first to build the game for me, then turn it to run on web3 or how please?"
"Which client id are you referring to? If the oauth app were deleted from the Google console or the domain to which the oauth tokens are issued were to stop working, the user would not have a valid token to present to torus to retrieve their keys from the torus network, and would be unable to reconstruct their key."
"The client-id my startup gets from Torus that is used in calls to Torus. My question is just, if my startup were to die, what does the user need to still have access to the funds held by their private key?"
"if the startup were to die but the user still has the ability to get a valid oauth token from the oauth provider (domain still valid, oauth app not deleted from oauth provider dashboard) then the token can always be presented to Torus network to retrieve the key parts and reconstruct. Once the verifier is deployed to the Torus network I would assume that it will be there for ever."
"basically it means there may need to be a minimal app still present at the domain for the user to sign in and transition out, right?"
"yes thats exactly right... basically just the whole auth flow, and a way to display the private key in plain text - this can then be imported into another wallet for instance"
"It would also be a pretty big security risk if it were true, because any app that gets you to connect via Web3Auth would then have full control over your wallet. It has to be an individual wallet per app"
"Yes, it's individual per app"
"Although we're working on exportability between applications, so in the future (on user prompt and permission), you'd be able to use the torus wallet UI with your app specific key pair"
This is scheduled for q2 this year
"yeah it would have to be a privileged app by you guys, one that makes it clear to users that these wallets are associated with their login. I'm not sure you could do it with a custom auth provider but you could do it with oauth, email/password, etc, right?"
"Even if the torus network is down, user can recover the key as long as he sets up 2/3.. he can just have the other 2 factors to reconstruct"
Via a redirect flow we could do it with a custom auth provider
Clientids generally are okay to be public
They're always on front ends in general
k thank you
hey guys does anyone knows any honeypot checker smart contract example?
"Hello, everyone"
I have one question.
"After user gets wallet address from login with email, how will he control his wallet? He doesn't have private key."
"Hello everyone, I have a similar question to Guru - I was using Web3Auth OpenLogin and everything worked fine until a couple of days ago when the OpenLogin SDK suddenly stopped returning a private key on successful login"
anyone knows what's going on?
"Hi guys, I am a bit confuse. How can I read end user wallet account information (eg: token balance, etc.) after they sign in? I looked for ""provider"" API. However, it needs to pass user's private key. How will I know the end user's private key? Thanks"
"Pass the provider to web3.js or ethers.js constructor. Then you can use that object to access user's balance, address etc."
Does user need to install Torus or Metamask wallet by themselves? Thanks
Yep. They need a wallet in order to connect. Either they can use the MetaMask extension or they can use their torus wallet.
"For web3.js:

const web3 = new Web3(web3authprovider);

const address = (await web3.eth.getAccounts())0"
"Sorry mate, I still got confuse. Then how Web3Auth help end user to streamline the login process. User need to login through their email and also need to install the wallet by themselves?"
"Web3Auth gives you options. You can either use socials to login or if you already possess a wallet, you can use that.

So if a person is new to Web3 and don't understand wallets, they can just use their twitter/google to login and Web3Auth will create a wallet for them in the background.

But if a person is not new to Web3 and already possesses a wallet, they can use that to login."
"That's why I thought. Actually my question is ""if a person is new to Web3 and don't understand wallets, they can just use their twitter/google to login and Web3Auth will create a wallet for them in the background."", by following this scenario, I can still use web3.js to get end user's wallet balance, right? Thanks"
"Yes. Absolutely. No matter what the user uses to login, you will always get a provider that you can pass to web3.js and access their address, balance etc."
"Got it, thanks mate, let me keep try then, thanks for your explanation very much :)"
No worries man. Are you getting stuck on the code level? Can probably help you there too.
"Thanks mate, let me try first. I want to understand the logic of Web3Auth more, cheers"
Sounds good!
Is it possible to store information different than the wallet in the torus network?
"Question, is it possible to create multiple accounts (public/private keys) that are associated with a login ?"
"Hey, for the 'torus-embed' plugin how can I do some sort of eager-connect? I'm noticing on my app that even if there's a session stored from OpenLogin the user still has to initiate torus.login() each time they visit the app."
"Guys, I encountered this error when I tried to get the provider with user's account, anyone know how to fix this? Thanks"
"Just use:
as unknown as ...

This worked for me"
"here is the hook I created, it gets called both on the page that initiates the login and on the page that's on the 'redirectUrl'"
"Resolved the above issue. \nSolution:\nTo successfully read the private key from ',  , ', the method needs to be called on the same page onto which the loginProvider redirects the user after a successful login (defined in the ',  , ' field in ',  , ' method)'"
My issue was caused by trying to read this data from a different page after the redirect
Thanks for sharing
"Hi all, is there any sample code for calling the provider? I keep encountered the error like attached? Anyone can give me a hand? Many thanks"
Pls use provider as any
"Finally it works, many thanks"
"hello everyone, Zulfikar here"
congratulations to Torus for pioneering the web3 revolution by addressing many pain points
"we are exploring the uses of Torus for a custom authentication flow where we would like to ""force"" users to (1)authenticate themselves via more than one social login and we would like to (2) capture the email id/profile id used in the process
We have explored the product/application OpenLogin but it allows only one social authentication at a time and we have also read the documents for product/application CustomAuth, but it is not something we want right now, therefore my question is how can we achieve the goal#1 and #2 as mentioned above? Thanks for any insight shared."
"I have another query regarding OpenLogin: After entering Gmail id on the login page, the end result of the OpenLogin function is a ""Privatekey"". what is this key? Is this related to some wallet generated behind the scene?"
"Guys, I have a question. Currently I can let end user login and I can get their wallet address and balance. However, Web3Auth will create a new wallet (should be Torus) when the end user login during the first time. Can I let user to use their own Metamask wallet? Is it possible? Thanks"
"Wondering the same about the privKey field. Is this key generated and held by Torus or is it generated locally at login? If generated locally, is it different depending on device the user logs in from?"
This private key is regenerated on frontend only and this key is scoped to dapps (clientId) and not devices. User will get same key across devices on same dapp.
"No keys are held by torus , all the key reconstruction happens on frontend."
Can be stored any other information different than private key in torus?
"Hello, I have a problem with torus lib.  We are using it in our Flutter mobile app and have run into a build issue in release mode. Who had this problem?"
Looking into this. Will send you details in private chat.
We set up a meeting with web3auth crew Zhen Yu Yong but no one was in the google meet. What happened?
really upset about no showing at meeting and your communications
Hey... Zhen is currently travelling from denver and hence might not be available
Are you from krust?
Hello  I use  openlogin.  I try login with google on Safari iOS  after reload why I disconnect.  Pk is lost after reload
"Thank you for the link, Chaitanya!"
Looks to be a third party cookies issue. You might need to enable them in settings to allow session persisting
What should I do ?    Use no3pc ?
"Hey y‚Äôall love the project, currently building dApp atm and would love to chat through some questions I had"
Amazing job team! Does anyone know when Solana is going to be ready to deposit fiat?
Pls enable third party cookies in safari settings
I try . and now is not work
"we also experiecnced this issue before, this issue appears almost randomly, your best bet is to generate your react-native project again and install the openlogin-react-native-sdk again"
"Ohh , any specific updates to pod file which we should be looking out for?"
Sure let me try that as well
Thanks for quick reply.Will post an update soon
"Amazing, thanks!!"
no. the previous experience dealing with this problem is to recreate the project from scratch
I tried with a new project as well but still same issue although android login works fine
Expo bare minimum openlogin is working though the react native ask is still not working even with new setup. Let me know if anyone is able to figure out this issue
you created the project again still broken?
Do we have similar sample repo for react native just like expo bare minimum?
it is in the github repo
of react native sdk
Hi guys! I saw in the documentation a description of the process of using the web3auth private key to convert it to the ED25519 private key for solana. Is it possible to use multiple solana keys using one web3auth account? Any ideas?
I enable cookies but not work.
Getting a unsupported method type error when running my dApp on a Firefox browser and I try to connect to my torus wallet.  Had this problem a month ago and it was fixed.  But now it is happening again.
Same here it was working fine till yesterday is something wrong at torus end v
"Thanks for reporting, i need your help to debug this issue. Let me dm you."
We are using custom-react-native-sdk with google as verifier.After setting up the verifier and redirect urls on triggering login now we are able to login to google and redirect back to the app but the triggerLogin promise never resolves. Any idea what could be the issue?
Can you send me the logs or something?
You may need to set the redirect url scheme in ur AndroidManifest or Info plist
I have added the scheme therefore it‚Äôs redirecting the app correctly just the promise is not resolving
Do you got xcode logs?
Lemme check
hmm can u also give safari logs? you can get it with the developer tools of safari
Finally got it working with openlogin-expo-sdk üôÇ.
"Hey! Happy to be here.
Is there anyway to sign requests and validate them on the backend using web3auth? I saw no guides for this"
will there be a torus token?  and where to read about it?
Could you please advice I try to enable third party and I test is not work .
Hi all. Does anyone know how Binance implements their wallet (the tkey) system? Do they store the second key share on their server (encrypted with password input from user)? Or the password-encrypted key is also stored in torus network?
"since thurs my expo react native app doesn't return after redirecting to openlogin and gets stuck on the splashscreen after logging in with my google account, might the callback url have changed?"
"This may happen on Android if u are using testnet, make sure you are using mainnet and have registered your redirecturl on android manifest"
Hi! I take it this is not possible?
"Hey! Yes, I mean to derive multiple solana keys on one Web3Auth login. Can you suggest how we can implement this? I didn't find any examples in the documentation"
"Hey all. I'm running into an issue attempting to create a verifier on mainnet, I get the error ""Please create the verifier on testnet first"". There doesn't seem to be an option to transfer an existing verifier from testnet -> mainnet. Any ideas, or am I missing how to upgrade an existing verifier?"
"Hey, quick question about the 'torus-embed', is there any way to EagerConnect to the existing session? It's kind of annoying that for every page refresh torus logs out."
which browser are you using ?
"Hi, has anyone experience with integrating torus (customauth) with a hasura backend?"
Hi guys. Cant seem to find in the api docs the ability to get NFT graphics from the wallet. Yet it seems to be possible in opensea however. Am i missing something? Tks
I'm talking about anrdoid and ios sdk
You can use the private key as a seed to create a HD wallet.
"Yes, I understand that, but what if we need to have more than one solana key?"
are there experts of .htaccess
"Hi, you can only create  verifier on mainnet if there was a testnet verifier"
"hey y'all, hope your day is going well!

I'm trying to follow the plug n play react app guide, but I'm not sure what to do after running the npm install. Any ideas on how to move forward? Thanks!"

"Hey, I am setting up Custom Auth and have understood to connect all the native Social Login Providers and also Proxy Providers with Auth0. Now everything going well but except passwordless Email field like in Openlogin as shown in the attached image. From Auth0 all the Connections working fine but is just confusing to get to know to pass the user email by query parameters and also how the email passwordless login connection trigger. And found not any documentation on Email-Passwordless."
You can pass it as login_hint

Hello active people
I'm searching for guidelines about integrating external metamask wallet with my app using web3auth.
Anyone here to help
It's an iOS app written in swift
hello! is there any way to integrate coinbase wallet?
"with mobile right now, its a little harder"
youre going to have to go thorugh wallet connect + deep linking
we don't have an adapter for that just yet
"but its in the pipeline, or you can also feel free to try writing the bindings yourself too"
Do you have any guide to create one?
Thanks a bunch!
I need some help with the react app guide for Web3Auth. Does anyone know what to do after running npm install? Most of the tutorial code isn't working
Anyone esle experiencing issues logging into the web3auth dashboard
Which tutorial are you following ?
It looks good on my side. I can access to several of my accounts
Thank you I'll try again now
"Weird it worked once I connected to my VPN and would load, in now and thank you."
it used to work for the old torus developer dashboard..
"for example when i click on the Google Icon, it opens a pop-up but it keeps saying ""Redirecting"" and never completes"
i think it might be related to Webauthn
Hi. How is metadata stored? Are they also in a distributed network? Is it safe to store private keys there?
could be brave shields
"awesome, i turned it off and that fixed it!"
you an leave it on at low/medium
just not high
IPFS + caching server
there are no keys stored on metadata server
only encrypted data blobs
"strange situation, but when i log into my web3auth developer dashboard using Brave, i can see my project under Plug and play"
"but when i log into that same dashboard using my exact same OpenLogin credentials (Google login) but this time on Chrome macOS, i am able to login successfully, but i dont see my project anymore under Plug and play"
"same exact account, but different device, but now my project disappears"
that is strange
do you have logs
can you take a look at this further
not sure what kind of logs you mean but happy to send over my account details
liek is there any error that pops up on chrome macos
Let me try to reproduce it
Could you open Chrome DevTools by right-click and select Inspect then see if there are any errors in Console tab?
"I couldn't reproduce it, it worked for me both in Chrome and Brave (MacOS)"
did you click on skip for now or always skip button in any of the browsers?
"Hi. I asked the question earlier but didn't get an answer. Can we use web3auth in the following case - a user comes to our application with his private key (ed25519), logs in via web3auth and we save his key in web3auth so that when user log in on another device, we can get his key from web3auth?"
How safe is it to store his private key in metadata?
"Hi, 
I need a help regarding verifiers
I would like remove some of the default verifiers and add new one. How can I do that. I can change the order of the verifiers by using method ""loginMethodsOrder"" but I can't add or remove the verifiers from this"
You'll also need to edit the loginConfig inside openloginAdapter
can someone explain the 2/2 auth flow for mobile OpenLogin?
are there any docs on it
"for example i used OpenLogin to log into my dapp using my Facebook account, and it showed me this screen on mobile:"
"is that page only shown when it's the 2/2 flow, and it wants me to add a third factor to make it 2/3?"
that would mean that every new user to my dapp would have to encounter this page and make a decision (which would probably confuse them)
"any help appreciated, thanks"
Thank you so much Tai. Let me try this and get back to you if still have doubts
"hello, I have this problem with openlogin and the sdk in flutter, with any action that I do after authorizing it leaves me on that final screen of the video, both google and the other options, could you help me please? even with the example client account it is also the same, and with my test account"
Can you pls use chrome inspect to check the logs.?
Thanks for this screenshot. We'll fix this üëç
Could you let me know when it's resolved? so you know when to try again
"Hi, I'm having problems with the integration. Is there anyone to have a technical meeting?"
"Hi all, sorry for the noob question, I understand how the login process works in the frontend. But i cannot find any documentation on how to verify the user login on the backend.

How can i verify the user login on the backend?"
Anything other than Dev related questions will be deleted
You can use a personal sign as a form of verification to tour backend server
We're actually in the midst of developing a library that would help with hat
"So a verification would be a signed message in the front, then in the backend, recover the public address from the signature and compare?"
identifier on your backed would be a public address
"Ok, i send the public address from the front, then recover the public address from the signature in the backend, if they are equal, the user is logged in correctly?"
issue a challenge from the back end* also
"so like sign on ""logging in to app - random str"""
so that ppl can't replay signatures as a login
just wanted to follow up on this - any resources i can read up on?
since its apparently pretty new
we're working on that
let me type somehting up and send it to you
thanks!
"i would rather new users not get shown the ""Set up 2FA"" flow the first time they create an account on my dapp"
even though by default it starts with 2/2 (and im assuming it prompts them for the 3rd factor immediately)
will definitely confuse them
"probably having an option to set that up later (for example from some Settings screen on my mobile app, which opens up the browser, asks user to log in again, and then asks for 2FA)... i feel like that would be more seamless"
just my thoughts
"Hello I use web3auth in my RN application. For some accounts I get privKey is 63 character length (no matter which method I use, via social or via custom email.) But for my needs I need correct bip39 key with 64 characters length. What determines that in some cases I get incorrect bip39 key?"
If there's a 0 in front
You need to leftpad
Before using the key
"const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(`0x$ `, ... right"
but problem with the length of private key
"Sometimes the length is 64 characters, sometimes 63."
"If the key is not 64 chars long, leftpad it with a 0"
So 01736... For example
Until it's 64 chars long
Noted.
Thanks for reporting.
"Hi, I am looking at the documentation of CustomAuth but I can't find a function to store a private key. So is it possible to store a private key ? Thank you"

"Hi,
after authenticating with social login(eg: Gmail), a wallet is getting created and I can get the wallet address/public key. So, is it possible to get the private key of the wallet also to do the transaction?"
Yes that key is scoped to your dapp.
How to get private key?
Which sdk are you using ?
"Same question here, how can i get the user info from backend?"
"I've already implemented torus on frontend and it's working fine, the problem is the signUp process, as the user already has an email verified by another verifier inside torus, i don't want to ask the user to verify the email in our platform.

In the frontend i can get the user data with: Torus.getUserInfo(''), that will return an object with many data, including the email.

What i'm needing is to ask the ""torus api"" for that information from the backend to confirm that the information that the frontend is sending is valid.

Is there any way of doing this?"
Web3auth SDK
"Yes.. you get an app-scoped private key in case of web3auth.
You can get it using provider.request( ) for ethereum and provider.request( ) for solana"
"You can sign on the data from the frontend. send the signature and data to the backend. 
ecrecover on the backend to verify it"
Yeah got it thank you so much
"I‚Äôve doing that to verify the public address, I‚Äôm looking for a way to verify the other data: email, name‚Ä¶"
"sign on the data too, send data + signature => ec-recover"

Please help this.
How can I limit login options to my preferences?

"it will hide google login option from modal, similarly you can hide others by passing other objects in loginMethods and even change the order of login methods in modals."
"Thanks, I would like to show only one of the options"
Does it mean I need to hide the rest
How can I know all the supported options?

Thanks!
Can u share your config in dm

any documentation I will find on the website about how does this whole flow work?
All calls from web3auth are made from the frontend. we don't have any backend server for web3auth
"You will need an aggregate verifier deployed for this.
the configuration for the aggregate verifier would tell you about what those fields would be"
we can setup a group and get the verifier deployed
"got it, thanks"
Hey guys
i was wondering how i can add more wallets than only metamask and taurus to the authentication process.
anyone know?
Currently you can add torus wallet and metamask. You can raise a PR for the wallet that you want to add.
Hi Daniel - any more details if possible on this and what exactly the length of presentation will be? Haven‚Äôt received any email comms on it üôè sorry this is the only part I‚Äôve seen so far
Hey Team on mobile devices when requested for signing a message more than 5 popups are opened up by torus is there anything we missed ?
Any example of using aggregated multiple OAuth providers? Like: Google + Twitter
hello all
how do i get and save the address of the connected wallet with my website
With the method getUserInfo()
Does Web3Auth keep private keys in a database ? Or store them in any way ?
It does not
"I was just confused because on the homepage it says ""remove seed phrases and reduce support tickets"" so I wasnt sure where the seed phrase goes if it's removed"
It looks good and very innovative üëç
"I am not sure why this behaviour but for some reasons, The query strings get removed after a page refresh. I would like to confirm if anyone has ever experienced it. I noticed that when I remove all the code to do with web3Auth, the issue is gone"
I think know why this is happening. Let me try to reproduce it and get back to u
Thanks
"Hi developer team.
We plan to use web3auth's CustomAuth.
So I have a few questions.
- Are there any rate limits or other access restrictions for torus node?
- Is there a page that describes SLAs, etc.?"
"Was wondering if someone could point me into the right direction on this
I want to be able to retrieve a public key based on an email, no login required.

How can we have this tool for help?"
How are u today?
"when login is completed , I am getting private key"
Who can help me?
Do specific questions.
I am using OpenloginAdapter
I am going to get private key
Hey can't you help me???
"Are there any rate limits or other access restrictions for torus node?
- so for nodes theres a 80 new users a sec limit on the scaled network

Is there a page that describes SLAs, etc.?
- there isnt a doc, but we've done SLA's for companies in the past would be happy to work that through with you"
ah this is a tad bit deprecated
we've since moved on to using other services instead
this is what i'd recommend for evm chians
for solana theres an opensource repo where you can spin up your own relayers
"Hi, this is fixed plz upgrade to version 0.6.3 of web3auth sdk"
You can do that with CustomAuth sdk which is what kukai uses
Thank you for your confirmation. It was very helpful.
"Also, is it correct to say that the private key paid out in the above case will be the same one issued the next time I log in?"
using customauth will result in just the SSO protecting the key/ 1 share
you'll need to either use Web3Auth or tkey to get the additional split
"you'll need to either use Web3Auth or tkey to get the additional split

Refer to this to hide other social logins
what's the difference between 'web3auth.initModal' and 'torus.init'? I am using 'torus.init'
"Hi everyone. I'm trying to create a new Custom Auth verifier on the admin panel using auth0, with google authentication type. I enter the client ID just fine but when I enter the domain of my auth0 application I get ""invalid auth0 domain"".

Any suggestions?"
Not at the moment
google can be used directly without auth0. Any reason you're using it with auth0?
torus.init is for wallet and web3auth.initModal is for web3auth sdk
"If you have any explanatory material regarding the following, could you please provide a link?
I would also be very happy to receive brief explanatory comments.
- About the consensus algorithm of TorusNode
- How to verify authentication information for OIDC linkage"
I am not very sure but web3auth is the new version
"Yes, another sdk Im using requires auth0 signed JWT‚Äôs so I was trying to consolidate"
"In that case, you need to use login type as jwt and not google"
I‚Äôm not at my computer until about an hour to look at this. My authentication type was google. The verifier was set to auth0. So you‚Äôre saying the authentication type should be jwt?
Issue resolved‚Ä¶ needed to add https:// in front of the domain. Now I actually remember having this same issue with an auth0 implementation last year since auth0 doesn‚Äôt add the https:// in front the the domain they list associated with your application. Whoops
"after I hide all of the social logins, the words ""CONTIUNE WITH"" is still there, is there any way to hide this?"
"by the way, does ""Sign in"" and ""Select one of the following to continue"" can be customized?"
Hi! Is there any way to persist logins between page refreshes when using social logins? (I'm using web3auth modal right now)
It already persist by default
Which browser are you using
"Brave - shield disabled.
Web3auth currently doesn't work with privacy shield up and it doesn't work in Safari"
"initModal --> connect 
This is the order of calls I'm doing right now.
It Triggers a fresh modal after a page refresh. Is there another call I should make to make it recover from the persisted state?"
perpetually loading in safari)
"it looks fine, can you create a issue on web3auth github with your code snippet"
Just confirmed that it does work in Chrome.
"Hello, my team is implementing a fully customize UI for Web3Auth and I was wondering if there was anything we are required to include, such as your terms of service or privacy policy, etc..."

What‚Äôs the recommended webpack version? I seems to be getting a polyfill error when I use the latest version of react

"There is still no way to confirm anything on backend, only frontend"
"The only thing you can validate is the signature, nothing more"
I'm using auth0 with torus successfully so far. Is it possible to get the auth0 id token from the authentication process? I have another sdk in my project that requires an auth0 signed jwt and I'd like to use this

Also, is there an authentication URL by Torus, which after the auth would redirect back to the main application? (the SDK does that, but I need the endpoint separately)"
Trying this on vue right now but no success.
Hi everyone
"Hi, everyone, where will ""Openlogin Adapter"" config internationalization language?"
oh the uiConfig
It's the same company. We rebranded from torus to Web3Auth
"Hello, everyone, After we login success from web3auth by android, if we what to get address or balance through native android sdk, how could we match this requirments? we did not found the sdk lib."
"uiConfig only have 'appLogo', 'theme', 'loginMethodsOrder', the 'whiteLabel' props has 'defaultLanguage', but just the language name, we do not kown how to extend the language."
PrivKey'? so we need to use this private key to generate address and get balance by this address?
Does there has any cleaner way to call some SDK method directly?
"So, at that point, you can use web3j sdk to do the rest like getting balance etc"
Thanks for your advice.
"Hi developer team.\nI have a question about ',  , '  .\nIf I add ',  , ' in the following situation, can I fire the ',  , ' on either device-A or device-B?\n- Device-A (keyset completed)\n- Device-B (keyset completed)\n',  "

Alternatively, you can use web3auth without the modal"
Glad to hear that.
"Hi, I‚Äôm missing something, if someone logs in to my app using their gmail / username password, does web3auth provide them with a new wallet? As in, do they login with gmail and have a public address that my app can use?"

Thanks üôè! Will DM you regarding this
hi i have question with openlogin. yesterday i use openlogin and set Whitelist success. but popup not response Oauth signin. So what should I do get error message authorization?
No - they get different addresses because the verifier is different for gmail and twitter
Any pact developers here at all?
"Hi web3auth team! I have a few more questions: 1) Is it possible to display to the user a page or modal (ex. terms of agreement page) after the login in, but before a wallet address is actually created for them, and only after they click the chekcbox we proceed with the rest of the login flow? we're using web3auth core"
"2) Is it possible to merge accounts with the same email address attached to them, with the web3auth core library? (ex gmail + email)"
I created an account and I am having difficulty claiming a poap. Where do J find my Ethereum address?

can you guys update your website with this telegram channel? thanks
have you launched yet
"If you're using core, you're responsible for the entire UI. So, you can redirect to google after the user accepts terms etc"
Yes. It's possible if you use custom verifiers with the logins and not default ones

Was that integration ever tried? Does anyone knows an example of it?
thanks felipe
what's the difference between torus and web3auth?
is one sort of a legacy version of the other? could I use web3auth as authentication and then torus to allow users to get crypto using fiat?
thanks for answering
"almost, kinda there"
damn I knew something was wrong üòÜ
"the core difference is that torus wallet is a wallet

and web3auth is the underlying key management that supports that wallet and others"
so you can use torus wallet like you use metamask or any other wallet (and thats that integration)
"but with web3auth, you're actually building an app with a wallet internally or a wallet itself. this has advantages:
1. you own the whole experience yourself with your brand - users don't ahve to understand teh concept of a ""wallet"" to use your app
2. wrt to transaction screens you can manage that yourselves with a more seamless experience specific to your app

cons:
linking this to other dapps/apps is a bit harder, you have to go through the torus-ui-plugin so not as strong interopablilty"
"both web3auth and torus wallet work seamlessly with moonpay, they really just need the public address from us"
if youre building for 50+ over projects
you might wanna go for web3auth as you can share the same clientID/user base across all of them
web or mobile
"awesome. this projects are not from the same clients, however. users won't necessarily jump from one to another"
"these*

when you say linking to other apps, you mean like linking this authentication / use of the address to send a tx for instance, would require the torus plug-in?"
"these apps will be pretty similar. they're landing pages that allows for minting NFTs and the whole authentication is through an external wallet, or web3auth"
"once logged in, you should be able to buy crypto using moonpay, and mint. based on these information, do you think I'll have to implement the ui-plugin? Sorry, I'm a little bit confused with what you mean by ""web3auth itself is an app"" (not verbatim haha)"
Has anyone ever used the getED25519Key with react native? We seem to be running into an issue with the use of Buffer in the getED25519Key function call that we don't know how to resolve
Hi guys we are building a react native mobile app and wondering if we can customize the UI of the transaction screen (where customers sign) so that its not a fullscreen webview. Is that possible?
"Hey, just wanted to follow up on whether you guys were able to create docs about the 2/2 -> 2/3 flow (with ""Set up 2FA"" for first time users)"
"Hi there, I have CustomAuth implemented in my React application. I see that the user's private key is returned in the RedirectResult from the getRedirectResult call. If I want to access this private key later while logged in on the client side is there any way? I see there is a ""getTorusKey"" method however after tinkering with it it seems that this wants a different idToken than that returned by my initial login?"
"Please help. Anyone else have all their jest tests failing because of this error? No clue what to do, nothing is working:"
Hello guys
I am using Web3forauth for setting an enterprise project now
But found some weird problems
I cannot get detail user data from backend like user's email and wallet address
"Can you provide more context, which sdk are you using and how you are fetching user data from backend?"
You can use refresh token to get new id token for getTorusKey function
Or may be store key in browser in encrypted from
That package is intended for browser use only.
i want to get user info on backend. it seems like i need to run it on frontend .
"Yeah currently you can fetch it from frontend, in case you want it from backend you can set your custom verifiers with custom auth like auth0, firebase or your own auth server"
Also refer to this
ok i see. Could you give docs about how to integrate with auth0?
"I want to reconfirm, I want the user to log in with Web3Auth, I can get his wallet address in the backend, if the user uses social login, then I want to get his user information, I don't know if this is possible."
Will dm you
"Ok thank you. When testing the gettoruskey, I‚Äôm logging in with getRedirectResult and using the returned ID token returned immediately after to call gettoruskey. For some reason I‚Äôm getting ‚Äúduplicate token found‚Äù when making this call. Any ideas?"
"Is there any alternative that you would know for using this on react native, or what type of key is used for web3auth so that I could write this function myself?"
"Hi,

I was wondering what forms of 2FA Web3Auth offers, and whether it might integrate with a Yubikey.

Also, I wanted to point out that it was not super convenient trying to Google the answer to this question, or reach it from the Web3Auth home page."
"From the site, I have the impression that the main option is multi factor authentication using keys stored in multiple stores.

But I'm pretty sure I saw more options through Moralis' Web3Auth implementation at least."
"If you're using discord, you'll need to invalidate the token.
For others as well, you can only use the token you get once"
Starknet and starkex keys are only compatible with social logins
"Ok, thank you
In this case, how imx implemented this?
They also use metamask to make starkKey"
"I'm currently using this, but it doesn't have the getEd25519 function that I need"
You don't need that function. The ask returns ed25519 key directly
"Question: from an application's point of view, what is the difference between integrating with OpenLogin vs Torus Wallet"
It seems like Torus Wallet is simply another layer on top of the base authentication layer that OpenLogin provides
"but if my application already integrates with OpenLogin (i.e. uses it to get user private keys to sign them in with), then it seems like i could directly use those keys to make token transactions"
and no need to go through Torus Wallet
Is Torus Wallet more of a convenience in that case then?
Thanks!
Please tell me who is the administrator of this group. I am in need of assistance. Thanks
Do you mean that the private key returned after the user logs in is already an ed25519 key? Because what I'm getting seems to be a different format
"And also adding onto this, if I wanted to derive a Solana keypair from this, I could just use the key directly without having to convert it to anything?"
Anyone have any ideas?
Where might a find the info in how to integrate this into discord
"Hi team, when we implement customauth we found an issue with error:

web3auth different wallet from torus wallet
"guys, i'm really confused"
i use in my code a call to get the address of the connected wallet
but when i login to torus using the same email used to create the account
the address is different
web3.eth.getAccounts()
gives back a different address than logging in with the same wallet to torus
Looking into this. Will let you know soon.
Great thanks. Feel free to ping me if you need any further information. As the issue is happening on many kinds of devices (and Android versions).
"I found the solution to my issue, we had to use a different provider"
we were logging in with openlogin and not specifying the torus ways we were using
Which devices and api levels are crashing?
Anyone having issues with login using social for Torus? Im stuck in an infinite loop
"Hi I have issue with login 
Some email when login got error ‚ÄúSomething went wrong. Please reload and try again‚Äù"
Some use can login
I don‚Äôt know what happen ?
whats on your consoles?
things seem to be up
My pc  is working but I got report from many client and I can‚Äôt reproduce
Try to clear cache
Not working
sometimes slow connections are the problem
we can fix things if yall have console logs
Ok I will try
the priv key probably needs to be left padded
sometimes the str thats returned starts with a 0
in that case it isnt 64 char's long
left pad it to 64 chars
Thank. I got it and will try

"Hi. There is a problem on mobile browsers similar to the issue I've opened couple of days ago where the provider was set to null after a redirect. Previously this happened on mobile browsers and on desktop in responsive mode when set to an iphone. The problem is fixed for desktop chrome responsive mode, but now the provider is always null on the actual mobile browser. We've tested safari and we never get a non-null value for the provider which makes it impossible to retrieve the wallet key. This is the situation with an openlogin adapter (not a popup, we are using individual buttons for google, apple and email input). The situation is the same on your demo page."

hi i connect web3 with token contract. can use method call but not work in  method send. what should I do?
You cant use same jwt token more than once
Plz create a issue on github with your code snippet to reproduce the issue.
"So how would I ""persist"" logins then? I\'ve tried the ',  , ' & ',  , ' in ',  , ' from the ',  , ' object I get back from invoking the ',  , ' method on ',  "
You should either use getTorusKey or triggerLogin.
"requires an ',  , "" parameter that's either an "",  , ' or ',  , ' returned from the OAuth provider. Are either of those returned from ',  , '? Also, I tried automatically invoking ',  , "" without user interaction but it doesn't work. All I get back are log statements in the console from regarding the verifier and that the service worker has been registered. For context, I'm using the default "",  , ' as the ',  "
Yes getTorusKey requires idToken but you shouldn‚Äôt use idToken returned by triggerLogin function to input in getTorusKey. You should get idToken from your oauth provider directly without triggerLogin function.
"And if you are getting idToken in triggerLogin function then it must also be returning user‚Äôs privateKey, isn‚Äôt it?"
Both triggerLogin and getTorusKey functions are independent of each other and build to cater different user flows.
"If you are using standard oauth providers like google,twitter etc you can use triggerLogin function directly to get user‚Äôs key"
So my use case is I want the user to not have to login every time our web app reloads
On the other hand if you are using something custom like firebase or auth0 etc or some oauth code grant flow thn you can use getTorusKey function
I'm currently using a Google verifier
"How would you recommend I create an UX in which the user needs to sign in with their Gmail once, and their login will persist until they logout?"
If your oauth code flow supports refresh tokens thn you can pass unique refresh token in getTorusKey function everytime you require key
If you are using implicit oauth flow where refresh tokens are not supported thn you can store the key somewhere in browser during session. May be you can add some level of timeout or encryption on storage
"That would work, but it's probably not a good idea to persist private keys anywhere for security reasons"
"Based on what you've told me so far, I think the best solution is to use Google OAuth to generate a token id and persist a refresh token that I can use to regenerate a token id"
"I'm not well versed in OAuth, so does that sound like a reasonable approach?"
"Yeah it will work, just make sure the id token (that you will fetch using refresh token) is unique and not older than 1 minute before passing it to getTorusKey function."
Got it. Makes sense. Thanks for the help Himanshu!
hello! is there anything going on with rate limits right now? seeing a lot with our users without much load at all
where can we check rate limits?
"Exceeded request limit. You must wait before retrying"""
Which sdk are u using ?

seems fine on our dev verifier
just not prod

Can you share your app link here or in dm?
Curious if anyone knows of a more general web3 dev group
Let me check on this
"Nodes seem to be operating normally.
There are rate limits for new user generation though. It's 5 keys/sec on mainnet"
"i dont think we hit that limit -- seems related to something else, and seems to have blocked us completely now"
yeah we are looking in to it
"So, everything seems to be operating normally on our end. Pls check the infura/blockchain url you're using"
Ok. Maybe try upgrading to the latest version of the sdk

"Hey! Any best practices for using Web3Auth with a custom verifier during local development? 

Currently my test accounts all get the same test pkey from an env var and I only access the web3auth verifiers from remote environments, but due to this limition all my local accounts use the same private key which is not ideal.

others can find it in the future
hahaha
ill start an issue for it!
"Sure, we can get in touch regarding this"

customAuth constructor also supports passing network param
by default its mainnet
if your verifier is deployed on testnet you should change it to testnet in constructor.
you don't have to pay for this actually. This proxyAddress is used by web3auth SDK internally to read verifier details from smart contracts.
Web3auth is frontend or backend ?
frontend
How do I check on startup if a user is already connected without asking the wallet to connect?
How do you get the public address of a user once they have logged in?
Also has anybody ever gotten an error like this:
Does anyone have limit rate problems with Infura?
All the time üò•üò≠
You can pass your own infura url in chainConfig
is it possible to disable infura api calls altogether?  like setting the url as null/undefined?
If you dont want to use web3 provider( hence no infura call will be made) given by web3auth thn you can pass value of chainNamespace as ‚Äúother‚Äù. Doing that you will get a provider which will only be able to return private key and wont be able to make any blockchain interaction
"Thanks, very useful information."
How do I check if the user is already logged in on load?
"Hi, after the user has connected with the openlogin adapter, how can I extract a wallet private key for them?"
how can a user get their private key once they login?
You can get it using provider.request( ) for evm based chain and provider.request( ) for solana.
if you are using web3auth web sdk.
amazing thank you
"hey, is there any possibility of creating a combatible adapter which leverages web3auth to port to another chain? for example let's say a chain with the same key type (ed25519 like SOL)"

Can confirm that 3 out of 4 ios devices which are not working are iOS 15.4 (one yet to be confirmed). Personally I have iOS 15.3 which works fine as usual. Maybe those errs are misleading and it's the same version related issue. Any ETA on when are you expecting this 15.4 issue will be fixed?

is topup feature is available with web3auth sdk also. if yes where can i find tutorial or reference for integration
You can use torus wallet plugin with web3auth sdk which enables you to use topup

Confused about how to go about creating a Mainnet verifier after creating a Testnet verifier for Custom Auth. I ger a Verifier already exists on the network warning
"After doing some experimenting, it looks like you need a different verifier name, but keep the same client id. Is this the correct approach to deploying a Mainnet verifier?"
"If I pasted a JWKS Endpoint into the custom auth dashboard, and it says ‚Äúinvalid endpoint‚Äù how do you suppose I should go about fixing? Any reasons why the endpoint wouldn‚Äôt be valid?"
"1. No, it is not possible to get same key as torus wallet key in your app. Web3Auth Keys are app scoped."
for mainnet verifier you can submit a request from dev dashboard and some of our admin will process your request.
can you further explain your usecase with some example.
"Team, can you share more details for aggregate verifier, what exactly it is ? Is this some custom developed component from  Torus ?

ok thanks.
do you have also something with web3modal?

Oh thank you I will look at this
"Hi Guys!

Is there any way to skip the openlogin redirection when we use cognito as jwt provider?"
Oyopayo chochachi
"not sure, what is that means ""Oyopayo chochachi"" ?"
I think you can use CustomAuth and do everything programmatically without involving the OpenLogin UI/flow
"Is there anyway to control which login methods are available to users for the OpenLogin Modal for Web3Auth? I know you can control the order, but having trouble figuring out how to restrict login methods"
"Thanks for feedback, i will make sure to add it."
Our goal is we want to manage our users in Okta but can help them to create crypto wallet seamless through web3auth. Is it possible?
Yah to use this we should use openlogin adapter so it will redirect to openlogin and setup and account in openlogin as well since we manage our identities in cognito why should we setup another account in openlogin
Those sdks are under torus namespace even we use the custom auth use should use torus-embed sdk to get provider
Is there an event emitted when the Open Login Modal is closed that can be listened to when using Web3Auth?
You mean Web3Auth modal ?
"const subscribeModalEvents = (loginModal: any) => {
        loginModal.on(LOGIN_MODAL_EVENTS.MODAL_VISIBILITY, (value: boolean) => {
          setIsLoading(value);
        });
      };
     await web3Auth.initModal({
        // @ts-ignore
        modalConfig,
      });
    subscribeModalEvents(web3Auth.loginModal);"
this one also took me a while to figure out
basically you  can exploit  the MODAL_VISIBILITY boolean to know if the modal is visible or not
Do you have any example code how to integrate web3auth with Auth0?
we have a firebase one
should have auth0 too
"auth0 is pretty straightforward, and we used to have one but its a tad outdated"
"yeah, maybe the auth0 is straightforward but I‚Äôm pretty newbies about auth0 and web3auth for new project"
so it‚Äôs hard to connect everything at the moment
"this is the example shows we have to setup an account in openlogin as well since we manage identity in ourself why do we need to setup another account in openlogin

Is there any way to skip to setup an account in openlogin like torus custom auth 

Currently we have to use torus custom auth and torus embedded"
That would be really helpful. Thanks

none of this seems to be working. any suggestion?"
We even went into the github repo and followed the examples
You can implement this logic client side yourself by querying on-chain data or using an indexing service like Covalent or The Graph
You can get token price by querying an API or an oracle
"Also, Covalent & The Graph are 3rd party services and don‚Äôt require building a back end"
let me check..
thank you very much..
Any update on this? Still seeing the error
This must be fixed now. Please update to the latest sdk
"I believe I am currently using the newest version of the openlogin-expo-sdk (0.0.2) in my expo react native project, and am getting the Invalid login error sometimes. Does the expo sdk have the fix?"
so It will help us to prevent redirection to openlogin
thats actually basically using Custom authentication on web3auth
yah but it redirects to openlogin
openlogin IS web3auth lul
you mean just use the modal with customauth?
thats not really a supported flow
modal means web3 modal
"Nope, we want to use our custom UI"
"Using torus customauth private key to web3auth core, will allow you to own the modal and the UI - but the redirect will always be to openlogin. Needs to be that way so that the user can use the other factors like device."
"yah, I understand the flow, but currently we manage our identity in cognito so we just want to setup a wallet for them to reduce the clicks and extra steps we would to use web3auth so another steps in openlogin like recover email (which we already collected from them) give them the bad ux experience"
"sice we will can manage devices, mfa and etc in cognito if there any way to use cognito directly with web3auth would be awesome"
"identity management (MFA, password wtv) via cognito is custodial to cognito. Web3Auth is a non-custodial solution, that works with cognito - but NEEDS openlogin to function.

if you just want the wallet storage, without openlogin - then you already have that with Torus CustomAuth"
"okok, then can we submit all the required details like recover email from sdk so we can avoid it asking it again"
you get access to the firebase token and can use it after submitting it to web3auth
I will check this out thank you
can we add custom domain to view wallet ?
Yeah thats correct
"Sorry, can you explain more."
Does Web3Auth support IMX?
Hi! I looked for the answer in the documentation but couldn‚Äôt find any section regarding this
How can I have a social login without using OpenLogin adapter?
openlogin is the socials
is there a particular reason why you dont want to include the adapter?
"Yes, because it says web3auth, we want web3auth to be all backend and never in the front end"
have you considered web3auth-core
that comes without the modal
the only screen that exists is the one right after the login in that case
which you can brand completely
do you have a documentation link for that?
"Don't I still need to use openLogin with web3auth-core if I want social logins? And then that will open a window that says OpenLogin and ""Web3Auth is requesting info"""
"you can use your own ""logins"""
you still have to use openlogin
but the only screen taht exsits will be
this one
Is there a way to use social logins where that screen doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúsecured by web3auth‚Äù at the bottom?
"there is, using our non-ui SDKs but it takes a good 1-2 months to integrate"
Why does it take so long
cause then yall have to build the UI flows that go into this
after understanding the SDKs
between the login and your app there will be web3auth
for a redirect screen
This is from the web3auth custom authentication docs page... does this not include social login?
you can color the page
and customize it a bit
thats the whitelabel
"Hi when signing in with any provider with plug and play it says ""daily request count exceeded, request rate limited‚Äù from infura. It looks like Torus dont have enough API rate limit plan bought üòÑ"

"This is example is for react apps running on web browser only, for react native apps running on expo u need to use the openlogin-expo-sdk"

Use sign in with eth/solana
use this
"Basically you request a challenge, e.g. a random nonce to your server, along with your public key.
Then you sign it with your private key (see the sign method from a provider offered by web3auth), then you send the signature to your server. The server should be able to verify that you actually signed the challenge, hence that you are who you actually claim to be."
That's it.

"hei guys, im trying to do a contract call using web3auth provider but i get the following error ""intrinsic gas too low‚Äù, with Metamask everything works as expected. Anyone encountered this issue ?"
"Try allocating more gas, the intrinsect gas is the default before any code execution"
"i tried doing an estimateGas call and then pass it in the transaction call, but seems nothing changed"
"Try this in your transaction options 
gas : block.gasLimit when block is the latest block"
"Dming you, need your help to investigate and fix this issue."
"Hi Guys!

What is the different between web3auth and torus wallet?

torus sdks will be renamed under the web3auth?"
is it good to use torus custom auth ad torus embed with web3auth?
you can use torus-embed via torus-wallet-adapter and customAuth via openlogin-adapter available in web3auth.
what is the different torus-wallet-adapter and torus-embed ?
if we use openlogin adapter there is another redirection step to setup wallet
Sorry that's outdated
"torus-wallet-adapter is also using torus-embed under the hood, it just that it makes the interface standard with web3auth. So that you don't have to use different sdks if you are adding different wallets in your app."
"yes redirection will remain, but you can skip the openlogin setup page by passing mfaLevel: ""none"" in adapterSettings of openlogin-adapter constructor."
"okok, to avoid redirection can we use toruslabs/customauth right?"
toruslabs/customauth will be maintained or replaced ?
"Yeah, you can still use it we will still maintain it but most of our docs will be updated around web3auth sdk."
So could anyone help me with the session life problem? I'd really like to get conroll of session expiration
"Hey guys, trying to implement Custom UI login here and got this error somehow not sure what it means üôå but this is on Brave browser using web3auth/core v0.9.4"
ohh nevermind got it figured out üôå
You can ignore the sentry errors
We're working on adding support for this
"Hi Torus/Web3Auth team, We're considering adopting web3auth for a young platform and I'd love to know if one web3auth wallet can be using e.g. Google, email and or a wallet connected by metamask as multi-factors? We were considering allowing one account our platform to connect multiple web3auth wallets to be able to do this, but I saw some screenshots indicating there could be as many as 14 supported factors via web3auth, but I'd like to get confidence that something like this is actually possible and being done"
"Hey Thomas, would you be keen on hoping to a call to help us better understand what you‚Äôre trying to build?"
Hi All
I am trying to add Twitter as a verifier but it is not available in the list
is twitter not supported ?
Hello Torus admins? Anyone there ????
one more question about whitelisting url's
in mobile environment that whitelisting should be dynamic
when i try to login with expo/login example it is asking for whitelisting redirect url
for each mobile client the redirect url will be different therefore it can not be whitelisted
what is the solution or configuration for that?
for twitter is oauth2 supported or do we have to use oauth1 ?
for the custom verifier Twitter what needs to be added to the J
JWT Validation (field and value) ?
"about whitelisting, one of our developers will help you when they get online. I'm not exactly sure about the flow there."
"Basically, you need to add the fields that remain constant across your JWTs. This is to verify that the JWTs are valid."
thank you
do you happend to know if I have to use oauth1 or oauth2 for twitter?
"Hi Torus, I am there project owner of a project on Giveth. I have a wallet with you and account with them that I am unable to log into. It seems that multiple Torus wallets were created and now each time I try to log in, it does not take me to the correct wallet. How do I resolve this?"
As far as I can see we need to add custom verifier for Twitter.  Which oauth version is supported OAuth1 or Oauth2?
just realized that the my clientId passed in the code does not match with the clientId in the error screenshot
It would not be different if you have published your expo app publicly or exported it into standalone ipa or apk
"Hi Michel, so how can I whitelist the urls for the mobile devices?"
Please also check the error message in the screenshot. My clientId is different than the error message.
"Hi Michael, if I whitelist ""openloginexposdkexampleexpo://openlogin"" login process goes through. I assume expo's proxy service is utilized for the return URI ?"
they'll be able to hop on a call and help you out

anyone know how to initiate transaction with returned private key from the login session?
checkout web3.js
"Hi

We are doing an API integration
 
Is it possible to remove the opengin UI and 2FA request in the login ?"
trying to display the login option here on the modal
Ah‚Ä¶ for firebase you have to build custom ui.  Since firebase doesnt provide implicit oauth flow.
"you can skip the openlogin setup page by passing mfaLevel: ""none"" in adapterSettings of openlogin-adapter constructor."
"Ahh, I thought that might be the case. I don't need to use firebase necessarily.. I'm just tying to restrict the domain of google/email. Do you have a recommendation of the easiest way to do that with the plug&play option?"
"Hi Subham, I am looking specifically Solana. The private key returned from the login process does not seem a base58 address therefore I can't create a KeyPair object to initiate transactions"
You can use auth0 or aws cognito. Otherwise if you want this only for google thn you can directly create a google verifier with your google client id instead of using any proxy provider like auth0 or firebase.
Have you checked our examples in github repo ?
can you give me the link please?
Sure just a min
I was testing that provider. When i try to consume that provider I get following error:
"despite cleaning cache, removing node_modules and re-installing node_modules"
You are using mobile sdks?
Above provider is only compatible with web sdks.
"yes I am using ""openlogin-expo-sdk-example-expo"" github package"
ok where I can find the mobile providers ?
Specifically react-native
Our mobile sdks doesnt returns provider
You can sign it the standard way using private key.
yes but that private key I can't use it
this is how you derive KeyPair by using private key (this is from solana website)
"const keypair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(
  bs58.decode(
    ""5MaiiCavjCmn9Hs1o3eznqDEhRwxo7pXiAYez7keQUviUkauRiTMD8DrESdrNjN8zd9mTmVhRvBJeg5vhyvgrAhG""

"const keypair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(
  bs58.decode(
     when i put ""ed25519PrivKey"" or ""privKey"" here it does not create a KeyPair object <<<==
  )
);"
"try this:  Keypair.fromSecretKey(Buffer.from(privKey, ""hex""));"
thank you I will try now
Thank you Himansu how can i buy a beer?
"Haha, thanks man‚Ä¶"
Yeah coz web3auth accounts are app scoped. Web3auth provides sdks to build your in app wallet whereas solana wallet is a wallet built on top of web3auth hence different keys.
By app scoped i mean accounts are mapped to your client id and domain.
Does web3auth provides moonpay service for the scoped wallets?
There is a way for the web sdk
But cant be done for mobile sdks since solana wallet is a web wallet
can you provide the correct link of the websdk? Maybe from mobile app I can forward users to web to top up the scoped wallet
this would allow users to top up their wallets seemlessly.
"you will have to use this plugin, which plugs in features of solana wallet in web3auth."
is that mean it is integrated with Moonpay ?
once you add this plugin you can invoke functions to open moonpay popup from solana wallet directly from your app
above video explains usage of plugin for ethereum but process is same for solana as well.
excellent!
"We are doing it with JWT (Custom login) this options doestn seems to be available, any options ??"

"Hey, I have a doubt regarding skipping single factor auth, does it still remain non custodial wallet if I just use social sign in? As now even though a user needs to send access token to web3auth, you now have complete control over retrieving key from torus, is the backend code audited to check if access tokens are not misused?

And what happens when I use multiple factors with device being second factor? Key is reassembled on the frontend only? Is server also involved to fetch key from torus? 

Also is the client code audited to check if device share is not sent to web3auth backend?"
"Hi! Important question:

If I login into two different apps, do I have different public keys on both of them?"
1. JWT token is sent to different nodes which are hosted by different parties. No single one of them can reconstruct the private key. It requires at least 5 shares (5 nodes) to regenerate the key and each jwt token can only be used one time.
"But if both applications are using different client IDs, then yes the user would get two different wallets"
2. key is reconstructed on frontend only. Code is open source. I can share specific links if you need.
"Client side code is opensource, anyone can check it, report issues, contribute and code which is running on nodes is audited and opensource as well."
Ahhhh not really
Is there a plan on account linking?
Because as a user it really makes it hard to build and tie digital identity all across
Are you looking to build an interoperable wallet for your users?
We have a solution for that too
Oh that's amazing. Can I schedule a call perhaps with an SE to see get a deeper understanding please?
"Maybe this is confusing in the docs, says keys are reassembled on your portal then sent back to the app, so at certain point your portal do have access to the key.

Or am I reading it incorrectly?"
portal is running frontend code.
Ok.. portal is running frontend code..
"So it‚Äôs recommended to use atleast 3FA to maintain non custodial nature as login services have access to only one share? Share here means 
1. Device
2. Social account
3. Recovery password 
And in this case I can afford to loose only one share, else I loose my access to my keys

And if web3auth doesn‚Äôt have access to social auth share, this doc above adds to confusion: login services have access to only one share and thus it‚Äôs not possible for provider (openlogin?) to retrieve keys on their own? Why is it a concern if openlogin is running in browser context?

So if in case I just have social login, then the only share that I have is social share, which login service provider has access to?

That‚Äôs one last bit of confusion that I have.. can you please help?"
"provider, login provider and login services, all these terms are referring to your social login provider in above documentation context."
None of them are intended to refer to openlogin in above context. I think thats wht creating confusion.
"Yea had that doubt in mind, they are login providers.. makes sense nowüëçüèª. Yes that was causing confusion. Thanks it‚Äôs clear now. So none of the login providers can retrieve keys is what it means üëçüèª"
yes exactly.
we will try to make it more clear in the docs
thanks for pointing out.
"Yes, your users can connect straight to your app with their wallet, and with Web3Auth, we combine both user login/registration and wallet creation/connection into one step"
And they will have the same public key across the different apps?
Do you have a sample list of apps that you‚Äôre referring to?

"Hi 
Is it possible to use web3auth to store external privKeys?
I got an web application which is connected to blockchain test network.
When user creates account (providing username, email etc) app creates blockchain account. User doesn't even know about blockchain behind.
At this moment I need to securely store private key somewhere.
Can I use web3auth for this scenario?"
"hi lionell, thanks for the help, but it does not work"
do you have a working example with a modal configured to behaviour differently to the normal one?
"I ran into the issue, web3auth please share a working example for the modal configuration!"

"Hi everyone, we are very excited about using web3Auth, potentially switching from Magic Link, but we can't figure out how to do something very basic becuase we can't find it in the documentation. Teh very basic behavior is this: Our user need to be able to select and change the network/chainId without being forced to re-authenticate, just like you can do in Metamask and in the Torus wallet itself. We can select the network at login, but we can't find anything that says how to allow the user to change networks after login. I imagine it is something very basic for those more experienced with web3Auth, but any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
"Could you please help with custom auth setup (I'm trying to do Apple sign in)? I understand I need to create a verifier, the type is probably ""custom"" for Apple, but where do I get JWK endpoint and JWT validation fields with values?"

HiÔºåadmin
Will Web3auth have a node plan?
you can call wallet_switchEthereumChain rpc function on web3auth provider along with chainId in params
"Hello everyone, does anybody have an example of implementing custodial wallets on a React application with AWS Cognito user pools?"
I would love that too
we dont do custodial wallets here
but you can try adjusting this to cognito
Why not?
"I basically want my users to sign up to my application using Web2 AWS cognito, behind the scenes I want a wallet to be created for them so as when they purchase an ERC721, they can pay through PayPal/Stripe and the NFT is tied to their Web2 account"
It's important for adoption that these things are abstracted away for non tech savvy users
You're able to do that with our non custodial solutions as well. Our key management is setup to emulate flows that non tech savvy users are familiar with: logging into a Web 2 account on a trusted device.
"Thank you, my question is tough, can I integrate this into my existing custom UI that uses cognito and AWS amplify for Auth?"
Yes you can
Yes you can

I want to build a dapp with Archway and have an authentication that allows Keplr and social logins together with Gmail wallet creation.

I could go the route of integrating just Keplr but that would not allow social logins.

Which would be the best way to do it for Flutter? I see there is support for multichain, but I dont see exactly how this could be done, taking into account that Keplr itself was using web3auth."

hello -- having some issues with getting google auth setup properly. we have twitter setup via the auth0 provider successfully and attempting to do the same thing for google but running into:
we are using customauth)
"also noticed that in one of the examples the clientid being used for a google verifier was the clientid provided by google and not auth0...seemed strange

is it possible to get the flow to work w/ auth0 -- primarily to help manage the refresh tokens since google auth has a 1 hour expiration?"
There is also one more option none which removes the 2fa
"So it is not currently possible to configure it from the dashboard, right? Is a planned option or it will always be required to connect you directelly to deploy an aggregatec verifier. Asking, because I‚Äôm currently doing research (PoC) and if everything goes well we are going to integrate the auth and the wallet into several our products and for that we would need to configure several different verifiers (including aggregate ones)‚Ä¶
Could you plese tell what details should I provide to get a test aggregate verifier deployed for me.
Thanks for the advice."

"Hi, what is the best way to handle web3auth sessions? I am using custom auth with firebase. After logging in with firebase, I pass the jwt token to web3auth and everything is fine. However, if the user closes the window without logging out, when the user visits the website again, firebase auth remembers the user, but web3auth seems to be logged out/buggy? Is there an official docs somewhere explaining how to handle web3auth sessions? Or can someone explain it here?"
We're having active sessions api coming out tomorrow
I see. Is there an eta for this?

or maybe the move is just use ethers to generate random keys?
"yeah u are correct these are unsigned tokens so our nodes will reject it. Yeah you can use ethers to generate random keys for testing , depends on your testing scenario."
