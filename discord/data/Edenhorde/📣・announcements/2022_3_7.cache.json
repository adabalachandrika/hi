On that note, I would like to welcome two new Guardians. \n\n**Larriks**\nWe have received various applications for the Larrik tribe. <@!362813371864842240> did some fun stuff and created a good start for the Larriks, but let's be honest, he could use some help. After the current Guardians were all really excited about these guardians and their applications, the decision was an easy one. \n\nPlease all welcome <@!543414592366444574> & <@!662059078796967946> as Larriks Guardians!",
