In this episode you have the opportunity to claim the treasures you found in episode 1. This is done through a smart contract that allows you to claim these expansive NFTs all at once. \n\nUpon launch we were met with a little hiccup where some people wrongfully claimed just the Necklace. This has been resolved in a matter of minutes, and eventually just 16 wallets wrongfully claimed their items. We have identified these wallets and want to offer them a solution.\n\n**What if I wrongfully claimed?**\n\nPlease head over to <#955751465354420254> explaining your situation. If you are among these wallets that wrongfully claimed, we will share the further instructions to swap your wrongfully claimed NFT with the one of your preference. \n\nThanks for understanding and apologies for any inconvenience caused!",
