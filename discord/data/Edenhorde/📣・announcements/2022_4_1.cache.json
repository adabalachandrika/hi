It took a while but the lovely team at Vulcan helped us tremendously to make it work! Perfect timing with the recent Discord breaches. \n\n**What is Vulcanbot?**\nWith Vulcanbot (vulcanbot.io) you can verify you're holding Edenhorde NFTs and thereby claim the roles for these assets! This is done without having to connect your wallet, you simply add a string of characters to your OpenSea bio. \n\nNo clicking suspicious links; no 3rd party signatures. Vulcan will never ask you to connect your wallet to a website.\n\n**How do I verify using Vulcanbot?**\nHead over to <#955404423016906792> and follow the steps provided there!\n\nMeanwhile, the issue with the wrongfully assigned roles has been fixed! Collab.Land's team helped out here as well and we have not seen anything going wrong there in the past two days. \n\n*Collab land will still work, we're simply offering a second option*\n\nThat said - What's currently going on for all the roles?\n\n**Holders** - Betwixt giveaway (Win 10 presale spots and 2 free NFTs)\n**Gadirans** - Recently added a new bot where they're racing to become the wealthiest Gadiran\n**Larriks** - Fishing, a lot of fishing happening here. \n**Oru & Babbumatta** - Contemplating what to bring their tribe-members next \ud83d\ude09",

                "content": "Hi @everyone \n\nAs you might have heard the official Captcha bot, Ticket Tool and possibly other bots have been compromised. This has caused both the BAYC and Doodles discord servers to be hacked and false mints are spread. \n\nLuckily we do NOT use the Captcha bot. We were using the 'Ticket Tool' which we have since then removed. We are double-checking all other bots that we are using to ensure our server is safe. \n\nHowever, we do once again ask you to run through your own digital security. Make sure you have 2FA installed and never click any random links you see, ALWAYS verify if it's legit with the official sources. \n\nAs an extra layer of security, head over to your personal settings in Discord and deauthorize the Captcha Bot as one of the trusted apps, shown in the image attached. \n\nStay safe frens \u2764\ufe0f",
