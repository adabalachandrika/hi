MetaMask is 100% fine, but the issues start with trust wallet and Coinbase wallet. Anyone that runs into issues can do two things;\n\n1. Migrate your wallet and import it to MetaMask. Try again and most likely the selecting will be fine.\n\n2. Fill in this form; (https://forms.gle/bwu4cdb7CdEVRr66A) and we will assist you manually! Please be as elaborate as possible when describing your issue. We will look at all each submission and cross-check with the snapshot that was taken on the 28th of February 14:00 CET.\n\nPlease note: If you DID NOT own an Edenhorde NFT before the 28th of February 14:00 CET - you CAN NOT claim your treasure. Only those who held an Edenhorde NFT before this date are eligible. \n\n*What will Allafred uncover when he returns to the surface of the water?*",
