Hi there üëã

Hope @everyone is doing well!

Last week we dropped the second episode of the Edenhorde story. In this episode you have the opportunity to claim the treasures you found in episode 1. This is done through a smart contract that allows you to claim these expansive NFTs all at once. 

Upon launch we were met with a little hiccup where some people wrongfully claimed just the Necklace. This has been resolved in a matter of minutes, and eventually just 16 wallets wrongfully claimed their items. We have identified these wallets and want to offer them a solution.

**What if I wrongfully claimed?**

Please head over to <#955751465354420254> explaining your situation. If you are among these wallets that wrongfully claimed, we will share the further instructions to swap your wrongfully claimed NFT with the one of your preference. 

Thanks for understanding and apologies for any inconvenience caused!

Hi @everyone!

By popular demand I've created this channel and separated the Twitter announcements in <#936583120776466562> - if you would like to stay up to date with all we do I suggest you either put this channel on notifications, or allow notifications on Twitter. 

All major announcements will also be shared in this channel. On that note, I would like to welcome two new Guardians. 

**Larriks**
We have received various applications for the Larrik tribe. <@!362813371864842240> did some fun stuff and created a good start for the Larriks, but let's be honest, he could use some help. After the current Guardians were all really excited about these guardians and their applications, the decision was an easy one. 

Please all welcome <@!543414592366444574> & <@!662059078796967946> as Larriks Guardians!

Hi @everyone 

Hope all is well!

In anticipation of the second chapter, we are still receiving quite some people who are having issues selecting their treasures. MetaMask is 100% fine, but the issues start with trust wallet and Coinbase wallet. Anyone that runs into issues can do two things;

1. Migrate your wallet and import it to MetaMask. Try again and most likely the selecting will be fine.

2. Fill in this form; (https://forms.gle/bwu4cdb7CdEVRr66A) and we will assist you manually! Please be as elaborate as possible when describing your issue. We will look at all each submission and cross-check with the snapshot that was taken on the 28th of February 14:00 CET.

Please note: If you DID NOT own an Edenhorde NFT before the 28th of February 14:00 CET - you CAN NOT claim your treasure. Only those who held an Edenhorde NFT before this date are eligible.
