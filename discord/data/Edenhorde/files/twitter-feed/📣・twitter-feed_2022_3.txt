Hi @everyone,

As we embarked on our journey through the worlds of Edenhorde through the release of the first chapter, we felt that it’s time to bring some more action to this Discord server.

We currently have a minimal amount of channels, we did so deliberately. Given the fact that we have four unique tribes all living in different places across Edenhorde, wouldn’t it make sense for each tribe to create their own environment?

**What does that mean?**
Each tribe will get their own category where they are allowed to create their own channels according to the needs and wants of their fellow tribe-members. Larriks might talk endlessly about fishing, while Babbumatta are more keen on discussing photosynthesis. We want to give each tribe the opportunity to create an environment they feel most comfortable in.

Naturally, there will be overarching channels where everyone can come together and chat with others, but the environments of the tribes will become a more dominant part of the server.

**How does this all start?**
To bring a bit of structure to this change, we suggest that each tribe brings forward up to four guardians who will lead this process. These guardians will be in touch with the administration on this server to add new channels, discuss events and anything in between.

**How do I apply to become a guardian?**
We have created a simple google form to collect applications for guardianship. You pick a tribe of your preference (you must own an NFT of this collection), and write a small motivation why you would be a good fit to become a guardian. After collecting the applications, we’ll crown the guardians for each tribe and changes will be made accordingly. 

Apply here → https://forms.gle/NJFAvJFEF9d8KRkG6

We are excited to have each one of you join us and help shape the future of Edenhorde in collaboration with you, our Edenhorde family.

Hi @everyone

Two days ago we have initiated a new structure for this Discord server, and therefore our entire community. Quick reminder;

> ***Each tribe will get their own category where they are allowed to create their own channels according to the needs and wants of their fellow tribe-members. Larriks might talk endlessly about fishing, while Babbumatta are more keen on discussing photosynthesis. We want to give each tribe the opportunity to create an environment they feel most comfortable in.
> 
> Naturally, there will be overarching channels where everyone can come together and chat with others, but the environments of the tribes will become a more dominant part of the server.***

Today, we are proud to present the very first Guardians!

**Gadirans**: <@!319584827797929984> & <@!947768446664474635> 
**Babbumatta**: <@!650591395366699021> <@!613837024755056691> <@!908880565908955147> <@!881230798144036925> 
**Oru**: <@!369186378270900235> & <@!643542755133620234> 
**Larriks**: <@!362813371864842240> 

We welcome each one of you to the guardianship of your respected tribe. Anyone else, expect some changes to your tribe’s environment happening soon!

If you were not selected, you can still apply, but applications go through the existing guardianship now too. Apply here → https://forms.gle/NJFAvJFEF9d8KRkG6
