The total amount stolen accounts for: 8.65 ETH (~$23,500).\n\nWe have reimbursed everyone who fell victim to this account (incl. TxFees).\nTxHash: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9f519e9b29ad51e52220980ea98ab315f3a1896cf8d9232319c9d844a875ad6d\n\nWith that, we close this dark chapter and look forward to further build this amazing community together. I would also like to give a brief reminder that we'd never ask the community to directly send funds or NFTs to a specific wallet address.\n\nOfficial website: https://edenhorde.world/\nOfficial Opensea link: https://opensea.io/collection/edenhorde-official\n\nThe Edenhorde Team",
