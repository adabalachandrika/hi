This compromised account was then used to post a scam link for transactions as an announcement. Members of this community have lost funds this evening due to this. \n\nWe have communicated and reacted quickly, removing the hacked account and removing the webhooks that were being used to send the messages.\n\nIt deeply saddens me to send this to you all. It's a shame to end what's been such an exciting and supportive week for us all as a community on such a sour note and we can only deeply apologise for what's happened.\n\nI hope it goes without saying we will *of course* refund those who fell victim to this hack and we will be implementing new measures to maintain security for this server going forward.\n\nChannels in the server may remain locked for a short period as we carefully open things back up.\n\nThe Edenhorde Team",
