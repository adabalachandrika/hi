Quick reminder;\n\n> ***Each tribe will get their own category where they are allowed to create their own channels according to the needs and wants of their fellow tribe-members. Larriks might talk endlessly about fishing, while Babbumatta are more keen on discussing photosynthesis. We want to give each tribe the opportunity to create an environment they feel most comfortable in.\n> \n> Naturally, there will be overarching channels where everyone can come together and chat with others, but the environments of the tribes will become a more dominant part of the server.***\n\nToday, we are proud to present the very first Guardians!\n\n**Gadirans**: <@!319584827797929984> & <@!947768446664474635> \n**Babbumatta**: <@!650591395366699021> <@!613837024755056691> <@!908880565908955147> <@!881230798144036925> \n**Oru**: <@!369186378270900235> & <@!643542755133620234> \n**Larriks**: <@!362813371864842240> \n\nWe welcome each one of you to the guardianship of your respected tribe. Anyone else, expect some changes to your tribe\u2019s environment happening soon!\n\nIf you were not selected, you can still apply, but applications go through the existing guardianship now too. Apply here \u2192 https://forms.gle/NJFAvJFEF9d8KRkG6",
