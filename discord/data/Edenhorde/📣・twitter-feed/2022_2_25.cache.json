                "content": "Hi @everyone\n\nHope you are all doing well. We would like to share an important update for the Merit Circle DAO, the DAO that created Edenhorde. This update indirectly affects Edenhorde. \n\nYesterday, the Merit Circle DAO has accepted MIP-10 'Framework around financial terms for games developed by Merit Circle DAO' with 100% support by the token holders. Given the fact that Edenhorde falls under this DAO, this framework has impact on the future of Edenhorde. To display this framework properly, we would love to share this visual representation of this framework.\n\nWe envision a future where another game (not directly affiliated with Edenhorde) will generate revenue that will flow to both the Merit Circle DAO and the game developers. The percentage that flows to the Merit Circle DAO is then distributed among $MC stakers, Edenhorde NFT holders and a percentage or the Merit Circle treasury. \n\nTo read the full proposal, please follow this link: https://gov.meritcircle.io/t/framework-around-financial-terms-for-games-developed-by-merit-circle-dao/294\n\nPlease note, this exact breakdown as shown in the visual is not confirmed yet. This proposal simply allows the Merit Circle DAO to create this framework in an upcoming proposal. Whenever this game will launch, and thereby create a link to Edenhorde, we will share an additional update.\n\nThanks everyone for being part of this journey! We are looking forward to next week's first chapter!",
