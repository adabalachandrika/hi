The launch of Edenhorde has been a blast so far and we are blown away by the response, you all made this possible!\n\nToday is an important day as the artwork will officially be revealed and we will find out who belongs to which tribe. In a couple of hours from now, the artwork attached to your NFT will be revealed. This could be an Oru, Larrik, Gadiran or a Babbumatta.\n\nAs we have mentioned over and over, we have tried really hard to make everything surrounding our launch as fair as possible. During the launch, bots and scripts didn\u2019t have the chance to do all the sweeping, this has been passionately done by you all. However, with the reveal coming up, we will not be able to control automated sniping.\n\nWhen we reveal the artwork, transactions can be sent directly to the smart contract to discover the rarity mechanics. This will be cross-checked with all the assets that are currently listed on several marketplaces, and you might sell a very rare asset for a price that you might regret later on.\n\nThe only solution to this is to simply delist your asset from the marketplace you listed on before the reveal (ie OpenSea, LooksRare etc.). We advise you to kindly check which asset you have received after the reveal and list it for a price you feel comfortable with at a later date. Of course, this is all up to you, we are merely trying to prevent any unwanted scenarios.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to the horde.",
