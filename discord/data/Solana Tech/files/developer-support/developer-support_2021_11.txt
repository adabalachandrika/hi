You can. It seems like a swap had occurred.
Not every action that changes balances is a "trade"
Anything that debits or credits an account. That does include trading. That also includes actions like paying fees, getting rewards, simple transfers, and more
Excuse me, could you please explain about it in more detail? üôÇ
great, ty
its been real backed up. the auto merge usually takes up to 2 weeks and checking error resolution around then.  i believe they are trying to come up with a more streamlined approach in the future.
Thanks, any idea on a response time from them?
bought/sold/transferred/taxed as fees/etc
Hey I have a question, is it possible to create a utility token that takes a *liquidity fee* with every transaction on a DEX? Similar to Safemoon, it will take a fee that gets put into the liquidity pool for the token. Currently Solana offers the simple spl-token program, so I'm thinking we need to build on top of that to do this? Also thinking about doing a *burn fee* to keep the token deflationary.
üëç
See above
Ok, here's a walkthrough:
1. I used `getTransaction` on the signature provided `4wjubwNgSsLd1j8XGSUpeSHaBGLMNVJvxNeVnvzG3Eg8ArcozsoTrJMrt6AYsEqHSXWCatw4aPCqgzZ8Ah9itT6q`
2. I checked the prebalances:
```
"preBalances": [
                87074337284,
                1562002120,
                1
            ]
```
3. I checked the postbalances:
```
"postBalances": [
                85574332284,
                3062002120,
                1
            ]
```
4. I subtracted the difference:
```
85574332284 - 87074337284 = -1500005000
3062002120 - 1562002120 = 1500000000
1 - 1 = 0
```
5. I mapped to the accounts:
```
"accountKeys": [
"5RJHbiaHvnRcLQs7S6xmHYC8nfAuXVt8PwGGrjRCaF6Z",
"FF8Sb1rFm8mhY9bTmi4GyHBdcd1Que9dCqNSyjFuysxN",
"11111111111111111111111111111111"
                ]```
6. Finished produce:
```
5RJHbiaHvnRcLQs7S6xmHYC8nfAuXVt8PwGGrjRCaF6Z lost 1500005000
FF8Sb1rFm8mhY9bTmi4GyHBdcd1Que9dCqNSyjFuysxN gained 1500000000
11111111111111111111111111111111 remained unchanged
```
I was directing towards the instructions. about posting a comment to get the attention of the github maintainers. Its usually the best way.
In response to a general question about pull request comment response times, I was asked for a PR link, I didn't think that was any violation, is that wrong too?
So steps to reproduce:
- Create SPL token mint account with symbol XYZ
- Revoke authority
- Use metaplex to upload metadata for NFT collection with symbol XYZ
so if I wanted to do this. How would I go about mapping the associated accountKey?

I have a similar problem I'm working through and while I see all the info I need on the scanner, I don't quite understand how to grab all the info I need
Yeah, could do.
<@!650324733921067008> maybe we could run a test on devnet to reproduce? mint a token, revoke auth, and then try to publish metaplex data on the same symbol/mint address from a new signature
same for me, loads the correct data and then load NFT over it
solscan goes right to the NFT
Does the same here.
and at least on my browser, when i search the token on explorer, it seems to begin loading the token info structure and then quickly pivots and displays the new "nft metadata" instead
our team has been practicing metaplex deployment on devnet but we don't believe this is related to our work, especially as it happened 6-7 hours ago when we were all asleep
It looks like the aggregation logic is iffy.
good grab.
but it's drawing the metaplex collection overtop of the token
the token authority is null
you can see it is seeing both the token and a metaplex collection
chiming in to share this pulled from the explorer:
not sure is it related https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/rust/token-metadata/program/src/utils.rs#L795
I have checked the code here https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/rust/token-metadata/program/src/utils.rs#L826-L837
not sure why it could pass because you guys seems have already revoked mint auth
what about when you do grabs with your own client or cli ? are the results what you expect?
And IF that is the case, this could be a pretty big vulnerability, as anyone could effectively deploy an SPL NFT for a genuine token, use the same symbol and mess up the Explorer Info for the original SPL token.
The issue to me seems to be that because some other account deployed an NFT with symbol 'SDOGE', the same as our SPL non-NFT 'SDOGE', the Explorer lookup sees two token addresses, returns them both, resulting in this behaviour.
We do not recognise that authority at all, no. And the authority was revoked from the original account that minted the tokens.
is it not supposed to be an NFT?  all tokens generally, are SPL-Tokens
hey y'all!

I'm trying to parse out the accounts that transferred a token.

https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3jA9HuoPW1qikiVuvKrHWfyXdaKAJsixDYPXCbXvaBTh6xVQC15JQh6aZRYqsrXXvPEzmt7ha3e8X1oeJfGmQoya

I can see the info in this transaction: under `instruction#3` it has the info that I'm looking for.

How would I get the info from there? it doesn't seem to be in the `innerInstructions` object like I thought it would
any idea who the new authority is?  
if the authority is not in your control, that might limit your options.
when you say rescinded,  what do you mean. ?
All explorers show it as NFT and holders data is messed up ever since
https://solscan.io/token/8ymi88q5DtmdNTn2sPRNFkvMkszMHuLJ1e3RVdWjPa3s
We haven't yet, no
did you query the metaplex team?
So yeah, this is an unintentional action. And not by any of the team.
Back in April or so.
The mint authority account was rescinded at launch
whose control was it supposed to be under?  and your saying this was not intentional?
Hard to say, as there have been a huge amount of transactions with 0 program data since.
We're trawling through a data dump of that now.
where is the transaction where the change happened?
yes
change in authority?
the changes were made 5h ago by a metaplex contract
I dont see any other address for token : 8ymi88q5DtmdNTn2sPRNFkvMkszMHuLJ1e3RVdWjPa3s
im not sure what your referring to. if 8ymi88q5DtmdNTn2sPRNFkvMkszMHuLJ1e3RVdWjPa3s is 'your' token address, the only authority listed, is the one in question.
SPL-Token addresses are unique.
Note, there is a 5000 fee as described as well
Looks like the following:
```
transferred 1500000000 from 5RJHbiaHvnRcLQs7S6xmHYC8nfAuXVt8PwGGrjRCaF6Z for 1500000000 in FF8Sb1rFm8mhY9bTmi4GyHBdcd1Que9dCqNSyjFuysxN```
You do this by subtracting each postBalance with the preBalance and mapping to the associated accountKey
The latter one ends up overwriting the first.
Resulting in two tokens coming back in the explorer, one SPL token, one NFT token.
this shows conflict: under files changed
https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/2484/files
also:
Which has now been associated with the SDOGE token.
It looks like some authority published Metaplex metadata for the same symbol
Token address is correct. We do not recognise the Authority account.
ok, thanks
Checked with diff checker and it seems like everything is in order. Try running the linter to format correctly, and end all be all try from start again. Maybe something is up with spacing
your token is 8ym..  ?  and auth in question is AqH ?

the error says I have 15, but I cannot find out why it is saying deletions, both mine and the main appear equal in the github files changed window
Does your mint grant authority to update to this account?
Could you give me the signature so I can lookup on my side?
You check the math to find differences between the pre and post balances, and reference the accounts they are mapped to. You can then use that to figure out what token(s) changes hands
1. https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-c
2. You can still use it, but it requires you to compile the programs
3. Try something like this. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/147851/rhel-6-4-openssl-1-0-0-27-libcrypto-and-libssl-missing
4. `cargo build-bpf` requires Rust + CLI
5. If you find an undocumented requirement, let us know or make a PR with it adding to the docs
It was showing up fine prior to this Update Authority account's activity
The authority account AqH29mZfQFgRpfwaPoTMWSKJ5kqauoc1FwVBRksZyQrt is not known to the team.
We will have an NFT collection coming out soon tho. And have previously deployed symbol 'SDOGE' NFT metadata to devnet via metaplex. But not on mainnet. And this recent activity is not ours.
No, the SDOGE token is not an NFT.
no
Is your token an NFT? Bit confused on the ask here.
https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/2484
<@!489206164270350337>
1. You said "You could also use C (to compile programs)". Is this documented anywhere?
2. The CLI method to deploy is too vague. I would rather use the Javascript API technique as described here:
<https://jamesbachini.com/solana-tutorial/#deploying-a-contract-with-nodejs>
3. In this discord channel, several other people have reported the "libssl" problem. Please provide a specific command for CentOS (and not just "I believe it is yum").
4. What other files will I have to install for the CLI to be installable, so I can use **cargo build-bpf**?
5. Does the Solana Javascript API also have undocumented requirements?
Authority in question: AqH29mZfQFgRpfwaPoTMWSKJ5kqauoc1FwVBRksZyQrt - with tons of transactions about 5-6 hours ago.
This is pretty urgent for us as we are in the process of being listed on GK and CMC.
Hi - we're seeing an issue where some (malicious) authority account seems to have published metaplex NFT metadata and associated that with our token, resulting in our Solana and SolScan listings messing up: https://explorer.solana.com/address/8ymi88q5DtmdNTn2sPRNFkvMkszMHuLJ1e3RVdWjPa3s
Link to PR?
Shows the transaction pre/post balances of each account
Is that a transfer transaction? Try this signature `24Qn1Uk1uN88vzBsP3kPrcTXRzu3p5Zi2X8B6bHwwgaJo7ceM5Jbn9BkRFBdds6YoT9jzFfZrWkA1p3UshXLErUJ`
what is anyone's guess on a response time in github from a question posted in comments to a failing pull request?
What you can do is check both, do some math, and see what debits/credits happened to the address
Try extending it with more custom instructions https://dev.to/cogoo/solana-how-to-send-custom-instructions-via-instruction-data-4g9g
I finished hello world , any recommendations on what I should do next ?
You can use a combination of `getSignaturesForAddress` https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress and `getTransaction` https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
I'll give it a go, thanks!
CLI commands are listed for create and mint here
Try following these https://spl.solana.com/token#example-creating-your-own-fungible-token
Yes, I'm running everything locally.
Are you creating everything from scratch in your local testnet?
Rust is usable in Solana programs. 
1. Windows has a bit of finicky support. It is recommended to use WSL
2. The current way for compiling programs is using Rust. You could also use C. Solana CLI provides a lot of things you do need working with programs, such as the `deploy` command for tests.
3-4. Sounds like you should install libssl. Install with whatever package manager you have, which I believe is `yum` for CentOS
The Solana CLI is just one of the aspects of installing Solana, there are SDK, testing tools, etc.
Yes, but in this case I have to create the accounts using the CLI, add tokens to them and then pass them in JS. It won't work with empty accounts. I'm really not sure how to create the accounts and mint to them using CLI.
Skip the `mintTo` since it already exists
Can you not just take the mint of each token and call `createTokenSwap` with them?
**Rust is not usable with Solana contracts**
Yesterday, I was informed of the following. Please reply if this is incorrect:
1. Rust does not work on Windows, for Solana contracts.
2. To use Rust on Linux for Solana contracts, you must perform **cargo build-bpf**. This requires that you must also install the Solana CLI (even if you have no use for the Solana CLI).
3. The Solana CLI will not install on a new fully-loaded Linux-CentOS dedicated server. The following error is displayed:
**error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory**
4. No one has described how to install libssl, or what other files I would need to install for the CLI installation to work.

Here is why I do not want to use the Solana CLI: I can do everything I need with the Solana Javascript API, and I don't want to do most of the processes shown in the tutorial (including creating a CLI Keypair, and starting a Local Solana Cluster).

**I hope there is some other way to perform the "cargo build-bpf" command,** without installing the CLI. Otherwise, it is impossible to create a Solana contract on a new Linux server.
Hi all,

I'm trying to use the JS bindings for the token-swap program in order to create a simple liquidity pool GUI, but I've hit a couple of road blocks.

https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token-swap/js/cli/token-swap-test.ts#L128

How do I initialize the pool with an existing mint? How do I properly initialize everything I need, e.g. mints, accounts using the token program CLI and then pass it in JS? I try something like:

```
  mintA = new Token(connection, new PublicKey('3ftyrEZohLb1ZvBHZiyfVKEmjT
TQNbxNKd7uFseLGgic'), TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, payer);

  console.log('creating token A account');
  tokenAccountA = await mintA.createAccount(authority);
  console.log('minting token A to swap');
  await mintA.mintTo(tokenAccountA, owner, [], currentSwapTokenA);
```

which obviously doesn't work because you can't mint from a mint you don't
 own.

```

It is bidirectional
Isn't it only for tokens created in Ethereum to be bridged into Solana?
https://wormholebridge.com/#/transfer
There are some bridging platforms out there like Wormhole that allow you to bridge tokens back and forth between Ethereum and Solana
I see. Can it be bridged to Ethereum even if I create the token directly in Solana?
You can read about it more here https://spl.solana.com/token#creating-a-new-token-type
At least, that is the current way things are done. They're not each deployed smart contracts like you would expect on Ethereum
Tokens on Solana all are the same, using https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token
How can I view the smart contract code of a token?
Serum does some form of multisig, and this is here too https://github.com/GokiProtocol/goki

Don't know any other form at this time.
Checked on my end, looks like everything is working as expected. Are token balances just not showing up for you?
Hello everyone. Is there a Delegated Multisig Wallet service working with Solana ?

Try `getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner` https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner
We are seeing a strange issue with the Solana Explorer, it looks like it's retrieving data from dev/testnet which messes up the token mint lookup.
Hi - any devs from Solana team in here please?
submitting pull request for uploading new token, but the error comes back the same and it won't automerge, trying various ways to submit, but same error comes back.
Hello!
I am trying to get the balance of a token, using `solana/web3.js`. In the response, I get `data` as binary encoded. On the Solana docs ( https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountsbyowner ) , it says that we can pass an optional `encoding: "jsonParsed"` and that does indeed decode the binary data. 
But `solana/web3.js` does not support this. So how do I decode the binary `data` then?
as well as make in-game purchases with Solana

Best for now is to wrap around the existing programs, especially for token.  Others, like end-user dapps, you may want to deploy your own version of the program,
There's a few options I believe: Jet, Port, Solend.  You'll have to look more into each project to see how they've open-sourced things to build your script.  Otherwise, there's the solana-program-library version at https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token-lending
Hi there, certainly, you can use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenlargestaccounts , but unfortunately this doesn't seem to be exposed in the rpc client at the moment. If you have the time, a PR would be much appreciated!  You'd have to add some bindings similar to https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/ef6f40eae0ba1ef8ab36fba1aec38ee74556c3be/client/src/rpc_client.rs#L4470 and https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/ef6f40eae0ba1ef8ab36fba1aec38ee74556c3be/client/src/rpc_request.rs#L101
the sending part would be the blocked part, but that seems to be going through, so seems like you're ok on that
what from my connection could cause this? blocked ports?
bah, might be connection related then
you should be able to do `solana-install init 1.8.2`

if i burn a token from this account using spl-token cli it works. but the close and transfer commands aren't working, what does this error mean to tell me?
it should be ok in this case.  either way, can you use 1.8.2?
Is there a command to upgrade or should I uninstall then reinstall?
I'm deploying over 4G can it be a problem?
on the machine I use now I installed the CLI sth like 5 days ago
Hm, that one never had problems... either way, I'd recommend upgrading the CLI to the newest version
devnet
You may need to update your version of the CLI, we had this issue in older versions.  What network are you deploying to?
You'll have to get a dedicated node and thread your application, NFTs have amount = 1 you can get that by tokenLargestOwners
Use the language-specific SDK which will interact with mainnet programs (I think through RPC calls, but not sure). i.e. be the same as CLI, rather than wrap it.

Hello, all.
Could you tell me how can I get an holder of certain NFT in rust program?
I hope to get holder in rust side, in api side I can get by using client.get_program_accounts_with_config.
But have less experience in rust.
üòí found it, `new_with_payer`
because `new_unsigned` wants a `Message`
Without going through crazy indirect stuff
I don't see a way to create a non signed `Transaction` in rust with `solana-sdk`
In python how would you decode the instruction data returned from the getTransaction RPC Call?
do you know the intended token spl usage? we should use source code as the base for our programs or we should use spl-cli or whatever to interact with mainnet programs and then wrap around it?
can some one let me know how to do this
Need Help, want to develop my own mobile wallet, user who downloads the app will get my SPL wallet
For NFTs: given a list of token mint hashes, there isn't any easy way to check for holder account addresses? Right now I'm checking each token mint hash for top 20 holders (and getting rate limited if i do it quicker than 500ms per token). If the collection is 10,000 tokens, that takes 2.7 hours to check for all holders...
I guess this channel is mostly about developing with the SPL and SDKs for it. Is there a better channel for questions about how the network itself works?

Hi Everyone, I am new to solana . I am confused between the address and public key. Are they both the same?
you have low SOL balance
Anyone come across insufficient lamports error?
yes I was looking for point number 2. I passed the filter argument i.e mint address, and it gave me the token account for the person X. thanks
did you mean this? https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/advanced/token/get-all-token-account-by-owner/main.en.ts#L25-L36
it can fetch token account by owner.
you can
1. fetch all token accounts which owned by owner
or
2. fetch specific mint's token account which owned by owner
sorry wdym? I may have phrased it wrong. I just want to know whether a token account for person X exists (for that particular mint). is there a fn for it
AFAIK you have to do it by yourself.
thanks. on that note. is there a way to getAccount if it exists. I could only find `getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo`. the problem with this is it will create one if it doesn't exist
when you call `getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo` you also pass a owner pubkey into it.
the owner is the account owner.
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L537
I see. when I do `getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo` for someone else. by default am I the account owner or the someone else
you can use https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L762 or custom your own token account parser.
if close authority haven't set, it will use token account owner as default.
how does one check a account owner and close account authority for some token, I'm using js sdk
https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/2414#issuecomment-955919250  Any idea what is going on here ?
Hai, im trying to create a solana wallet in react native using solana/web3 and got an error " [TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Transform.call')] " in this line ed25519.derivePath(path44Change, Buffer.from(seed, "hex")).key , can anyone pls help me to solve this ?
Hi, any Core Contributor or Community Support I may reach directly? I prefer to DM them first instead of me getting DMed. Thank you.
there are two situations.
1. WSOL: you can just close it directly. and all SOL will transfer to destination which you specify
2. other token: you need to transfer its token out (make its balance to 0) by yourself then you can use close account.
Hi, when I use CloseAccount, what will happen?
I think:
1. Transfer all Solana to the owner account
2. Transfer all tokens to the owner account
3. Close Account
Is it right?
awesome ty!
youll probably have better luck in <#560174212967432193>  or related channels. and id suggest copying the smallest part of error that makes sense in text.  tiny pics like that dont translate well.
PoH question: Having read the primer on shinobi systems site, and thinking about it, it seems that the network clock must run at the slowest validators speed, so that they can all keep up with each other... so a faster machine (than the slowest validator) could calculate future hashes ahead of time... so how does it prove history? How do we know any node spent a slot calculating that history rather than being told it in advance?
what is the context here? looks related to your environment, yarn, or installation/dependency issue
if your validator is not starting up you might have a validator already running, or another instance that has not been shut down, try closing any other instances and trying again. ` ps aux | grep solana or ps aux | grep solana-validator` to search for a validator instance.  you can try looking at logs or use verbose when you run the command to see if you get anymore info or errors  --help

üëã any web3 devs know what I'm missing with the issue here that shortvec encodeLength and decodeLength (https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/master/src/util/shortvec-encoding.ts) expect the length data at opposite ends of the array? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/21089 

I'm pretty sure this is not actually a bug (otherwise transaction serialize/deserialize wouldn't work, which people would probably notice), so just trying to figure out why it does work.
can someone explain where I can find what these errors are?  automerge is failing, not sure where to look
`getTokenLargestAccounts` only does top 20

Heyo is there an easy way to pull largest holders of a specific token but more than 20?
converting a PublicKey to string with json.stringify and getting `{"_bn":{"negative":0,"words":[22127744,7770787,46556922,61120705,33815569,32632618,19307227,5865125,41554856,1514719,0],"length":10,"red":null}}`. Any idea how I may convert it back to a PublicKey?
How do I install libssl? I'm using a new Linux-Centos machine, and I have CPanel. I have root access (I'm logged in as "su").
Isn't there some other way to install the bpf sdk? I have no use for the CLI tool, especially because it requires components that a new fully loaded dedicated server doesn't contain. Didn't the developers of the CLI tool foresee this problem?
Does this component solve the problem? <https://lib.rs/crates/cargo-bpf>
In the target directory by default. But let me reiterate: `cargo build` will build it for your machine, `cargo build-bpf` will build it for solana's bpf backend
I ran "cargo build" from the program-rust directory. It did a lot of processing, with no errors. 
In which directory did it place the compiled executable?
Yup, it has the bpf sdk that the subcommand `build-bpf` will use
https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools
Is the Solana CLI tool required for 'cargo build-bpf' to work?
You need libssl. Use your distro's package manager to install it.
Yes, I installed Rust first. And I just ran 'rustup update', it said " stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu unchanged - rustc 1.56.0".
I still get **no such subcommand: `build-bpf`**.
Is the Solana CLI tool required for 'cargo build-bpf' to work?
My previous message described the error I receive when I try to run **./solana-install-init**.
did you follow the install instructions and make sure to install rust  first? and update your distro packages if needed?
https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust#project-dependencies
I installed Rust on a linux machine. When I type "cargo build-bpf", it displays this error:
**no such subcommand: `build-bpf`**
Also, when I ran solana-install-init, I got this error:
**error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory**
thanks I will look into it
You're probably better off pulling an accounts snapshot from a validator, use the `solana-ledger-tool --help` CLI to dump the accounts as JSON, then do what you want with that
Hi guys, I don't know if this is appropriate for this channel but I want to pull a large list of Sol wallets preferably with some advance query, is there any public APIs available for this, my use case does not require real time account balance updates and such, a static list is good enough. Thank you!
literally been banging my head for like 4 hours on this...
wow... thankyou! Just changed the default & it's now working
Which key owns the source token account?
Yes.  If `--owner` is not passed, CLI will use the default keypair for the "owner" role
yeah, i must have done. Does that default keypair come into this command i'm running though?
So you've set a different default keypair path with `solana config set --keypair ...` at some point in the past?
which is a different wallet than the id.json i'm passing & the creator of the token mint
But what if its ownership was passed to a program?
just pure solana address returns '4RtqrZ2v6ZHmP9gqwUQMNASXbw8j1YqTNWbLxUAa3a61'

A signer?
Who can transfer sols from a general account?
kk cool that's what i thought thanks
Here is my PR https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/2369
it's gone
if i accidentally send some solana to an already rent exempt token mint account, and i am the update authority, is there a way for me to reclaim that or is it just lost?
what's the output of `solana --address` ?
thanks, but i'm not quite following what I would need to do to fix that?
`spl-token` uses ATAs throughout by default.  Presumably whatever the ATA for `--owner`'s `8MPyKtj9WDQJAcH3HHjawyvhQiTRN62L7cVAFu4yGWxU` account does not exist
Would like some help with my Token-List PR. It keeps on failing and was wondering if anyone can help
I can make the transfer in Phantom on the same wallet, but the CLI doesn't work
I'm doing this at the moment:

spl-token transfer 8MPyKtj9WDQJAcH3HHjawyvhQiTRN62L7cVAFu4yGWxU 20 HxiWkdyss4eeKWWy32omusQYMi4RJZSGcMYdhrCjmgFd --fee-payer ~/.config/solana/id.json --url https://api.devnet.solana.com --fund-recipient --allow-unfunded-recipient
so the fee payer needs to have a token account?
You need to use related `spl-token` command for it
because `solana-keygen` doesn't generate token accounts
Hi, does anyone know whey the 'spl-token transfer' command doesn't seem to work on any wallets generated using solana-keygen. I get the below error:

Account could not be parsed as token account: pubkey=7ZHMceMp4G951czXMx3U5pX4nb3u4msRZcRsMhuJmGWd
**How to compile the Solana Hello World app on Linux?**
I read this tutorial:
<https://blog.chain.link/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-solana-smart-contract/>

I will be using the Solana Javascript API (under Node.js). I will not be using the Solana CLI, since I am using the API to do all processes, and I don't wish to do most of the processes shown in that tutorial (including creating a CLI Keypair, and starting a Local Solana Cluster).

1. Is this the correct command to install Rust on Linux?
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

2. Is this the correct command to clone the Solana Hello World app?
git clone <https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld>
cd example-helloworld

3. That tutorial shows "npm run build:" to build the hello world program. However, that command is not referenced in the Rust documentation.
**What is the correct Rust command to compile the Solana Hello World app, after it is cloned?**
Please provide the entire command, and not just a part of it. Again, I am not using the Solana CLI.

4. Will I then be able to use the Solana Javascript API to deploy that executable file to the "programAccount", as described in this article?
<https://jamesbachini.com/solana-tutorial/#deploying-a-contract-with-nodejs>
<a:PU_PeepoLove:825149318448152587>
yeah i think so. thank you so much. i hope you got your answer too
Are you using Anchor? You can ask related questions in their own discord, but If I remember correctly it means that ownership of accounts didn't match
Hello. is there a page that way to know what  `custom program error: 0x12f` means? i see a lot of `custom program error` and maybe `0x12f` is a code for the error and make me think there is a page to explain this?
But if I were to deal with it, are there any other things I need to be aware of?
And with this possibly corrupting my own state. As can be done with `total_supply` for mint
Also are there any problems I should be aware of when instead of PDA using user supplied accounts for storing their data? It is just that I want to have more than a single storage for each person, which means I can't use PDA for this. But as the user will still have a private key to this account, it seems like he can mess with its data a bit, at least they would be able to transfer all tokens back by closing an account
It seems like it simply can't, but I want to be sure
Will `total_supply` come back to zero or not?
Good day. If I create a mint, an account with that mint, then mint some amount of tokens to it and close the account by transferring all funds from it
who knows what to send here
ty
<#560174212967432193>  and related channels.   otherwise runnodes, quicknode, figment, rpcpool, titan   may have nodes you find useful
for ata you can use the same like params to get the ata first, like find program address so you would do
`let ata = get_ata_find_program_address(params..) `
if it exists, you can just use it, if not you can create it.
`SPL token` may have a wrapper like `getOrCreateAssociatedAccount`
Cargo will default to `lib.rs` in this case. Look into this: https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust
`cargo build-bpf`. Which you won't be able to run. Because there is no bpf sdk included in the Windows distribution.
You need the bpf sdk to compile the program, otherwise you'll just compile _something_ for Windows.
Only if you get the bpf sdk running on it then
The BPF sdk isn't included in the Windows distribution.
anyone run a validator here? looking to get a low latency rpc node connection
how can I check if it already exists or not ?
I am getting an error -> Allocate: account Address { address: easdasdCP9KyFi9V2nqJqgjFA7qnQZGDobtA61DU, base: None } already in use .... while trying to createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction
You should get the toolchain set up on WSL instead and then follow on with those resources.
**How to compile the Solana Hello World app on Windows?**
I read this tutorial, which pertains to Linux:
<https://blog.chain.link/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-solana-smart-contract/>

I installed Rust on a Windows 10 machine, and compiled the Simple Hello World app that is described here:
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello.html>

I downloaded and extracted the Solana Hello World files from github: 
<https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld.git>

The Solana Hello World files are now on my local machine, at **C:\Temp\example-helloworld-master**.

1. What command do I enter from the command line, to compile the Solana Hello World app?
2. When I compiled the Simple Hello World app, it created an **.exe** file. Do I need to specify that it should now create an **.so** file instead?
3. Will I be able to deploy that executable file to the "programAccount", as described in this article?
<https://jamesbachini.com/solana-tutorial/#deploying-a-contract-with-nodejs>
Do we need to set custom RPC before we start using any of the commands on metaplex?
I'm trying to query **getTokenAccountsByOwner** and I'm receiving a CORs error. I'm querying from the browser. This has been completely fine until we deployed under a `.art` domain. Anyone familiar with an issue like this?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

hey guys, is there a preferred RPC node provider that's affordable for individual devs? Some of the options out there are really expensive
Are associated Token Account public keys in some way reserved? As in, what is the correct public key for an associated token program already has an account on it?
<@!483890519924277261> I myself am a bit hung up on how to Borsh serialize instruction data as enum variants from the nodeJS client. There's a PR out there pending review. https://github.com/near/borsh-js/pull/39. Tangentially related to your question. Mainly just commiserating with you üôÇ
and it is enormously faster than Solana Keygen Generate function in TS. Why is that?
Hey. I found this function. It generates random Ethereum wallet
Also one more question and I should be good :).

Good example here of how to send Solana without a custom instruction: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/record/program/src/processor.rs#L109

Is there a good example of showing how to send a custom SPL token instead?
I don't see anywhere where https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/record/program/src/instruction.rs#L54 is called.

In https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/record/program/src/processor.rs#L38 we get the instruction from the input data, then we match it against the RecordInstruction enum, and then just process the instruction... 

What am I missing?
Hi, i still don't understand it.
I'm reading the <https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/#building-the-escrow-program-alice-s-transaction> escrow tutorial, and the "escrow state account" is generated from the client.
Wich the pubkey need to be passed manualy to "bob" to make the trade happen. This "esrow state account" pubkey need to be stored somewhere or retrieve if "alice" and "bob" can't communicate to each other. How can i achieve that ?
Try metaplex discord https://discord.gg/metaplex
Hello, I need help with launching my NFT line on SOL
Those are processing the instructions. You can see it creates in the instruction.rs file, then there is a matcher that processes the instruction in processor.rs
Hmm, I thought that's in here? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/record/program/src/processor.rs
Those are the functions that are defining what happens when you run the instruction
like here: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/record/program/src/instruction.rs#L54
But what are the purposes of the functions below the enum declaration
<@!489206164270350337> Ok great that was helpful thanks
I believe js bindings are being created right now as well <@!785084693023424542>
You'll have to serialize the data and send to the correct instruction. You can find some examples here https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-api
As well as under the token/token-swap/token-lending
Say I have instructions that look like this: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/record/program/src/instruction.rs#L12

What do I send in JS under data, in order to select a specific instruction?
So first `getSignaturesForAddress`, then `getTransaction`
You would have to get all the signatures for an address, get the transaction data, and pick out what is a transfer https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress
Metaplex has some js libraries for decoding the mint data https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex
I would also check out metaplex discord if you want to get into specifics on their schema https://discord.gg/metaplex
What data?
What is the RPC call to list all transfers to a wallet?
You'll have to decode the data to get the metadata.
Ideally I'd be after the metadata json for the NFT
Next question üòõ Now I have all the Address's of the tokens for that account. How do I make a request for one of them to get the actual image?
I am! thanks üòÑ
https://github.com/cryptoplease/cryptoplease-dart
All good. I think there is a dart sdk if you want to use that
Think I'm making this extra hard by trying to do it all in dart :p
Your a hero ‚ù§Ô∏è thanks
`TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` is the current token program id
Sorry to be an absolute scrub but what is the "Pubkey of the Token program ID that owns the accounts"?
ahh that'll be the issue then!
One of them is required
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountsbyowner
You have to include either mint or programId
I'm not including the programId though do I need that?
[1] is empty because that's where the mint would go
The programId is the token program
Why is [1] empty?
What is the programId?
I would expect the request to look something like this:
```
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getTokenAccountsByOwner",
    "params": [
        "BeTs1yXy4JzLSmg674qkBzxoCNhp2KZFTn8qqDgi5mVJ",
        {
            "programId": "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"
        }
    ]
}
```
Do I need to provide a mint? I think that's optional?
Yeah, never used dart. Let me see
Sadly not I'm using dart code, I can provide it but not sure it'll be helpful üòõ
Is this js? Could you provide the code?
My request looks like this so I'm providing my wallets public key
Could you provide how you're using it?
any ideas?
Hi all trying to do a 'getTokensAccountsByOwner' but getting a 'Invalid params: invalid value: map, expected map with a single key.' back
Love to have you here. Metaplex has a lot of devs and discussion on what is possible, as well as the metaplex devs themselves. Try their discord https://discord.gg/metaplex
Its exactly as Facebook presented it in the Meta announcement, however we don‚Äôt wanna go to FacebooküòÇ
Hi all! I‚Äôm currently working on a NFT project together with a major event organizer from The Netherlands! I would like to get in touch with people who are able to help me out with what is possible and what not! We are aiming in the long for an metaverse festival with djs and their music anyone out here that could get me in touch with the right people
I would check in the Metaplex discord for questions on their contract https://discord.gg/metaplex
make sense but is it documented somewhere?
It looks like it is up to date. How are you calling it?
Is the solana python library up to date? the get_confirmed_transaction method is returning a null result for many transactions, which I can see info for on the explorer
From what I can tell, this function doesn't exist. I may be wrong though
Hi everyone, i'm noob in solana dev. I'm currently working on NFT collection using metaplex / candy machine. I was wondering how to update de nft prices after the initial upload on the main net ? i want to do presales with specific price, then update de price after the presales but i dont find any documentation about it. Someone can help me ?
Hi! Is there a version of https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/net scripts to run on existing servers? For example, how do I generate a config file if I have several servers with ssh access already available
In ethereum addresses we have a web3 function called "toChecksum" . It coverts it back the lower case address to its correct "uppercase" + "lowercase' address.  Does Solana or solana web3 has some kind of feature ?
Uppercase vs lowercase are different addresses. Unfortunately, there isn't a way to convert it back
thanks üôÇ
I am biased, but I think it would help long term before moving to Anchor.
Do you think it is worthwhile to attain some level of mastery over the plain Solana SDK first, before hopping into Anchor? I'm naturally a bit afraid of committing to a high-level framework before I have a more tangible grasp of the base SDK itself.
Hi,   I have multiple users wallet addresses stored in database . But by mistake  those are all converted to lower case . I want to ask that if there is any solana web3 function to convert them back to their original "lower" + "upper " case . Currently i am trying to use those lower case address , but my functions are saying that this address is not valid.
lower case address - drusqrpzjjdpt8aeczdwx2saaj92yuwwfvmq1ofxdfb7 ............ original address - DRUSqRpZJJdpT8aeczdwX2SAAJ92yuwWfvmq1ofxDfB7
You can also find programs using the anchor framework here. https://anchor.projectserum.com/
Anchor does use borsh under the hood though
Thank... I'll check it out
In regards to struct vs enums, I believe it is all a choice by the developer.
You can find a lot of good examples of programs here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library
Governance uses enums a lot, and you'll find them elsewhere too.
It seems like everyone and their mother has posted and rehashed the same "hello world" example, but it's really hard to find solid minimal examples of solana program architectures that are designed to scale beyond this by handling what one might call basic request routing, like you'd expect in a traditional web framework.
Is there a reason why most -- if not all -- of the example programs out there represent program data with structs instead of enums? It seems to me like enums were be the preferred method to represent different types of instructions handled by a single program. I'm just getting started, and since most examples out there use Borsh to serialize data as a struct, I'm wondering if it's a mistake to go down the road of trying to figure out how to serialize/deserialize enums instead. Do people typically just use structs with some kind of type code field to indicate what kind of instruction it is?
Let me give it a try, i still have to find a way to decode the instructions into.
You could use `Message.from()` https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Message.html#from
On the transaction buffer, which should give you all the instructions back. You can then decode each data object and do as you like with it
Im creating txs (which have different builders ex: nonceWalletBuilder, transferBuilder) but i have to extract the type based on the instructions to see which builder should use in case you want to rebuild the tx from the an unfinished/unsigned base64 encoded tx
You should probably check in metaplex discord https://discord.gg/metaplex
There is an update instruction if you have update authority. I don't know the technical details though
How are you getting the rpc call response? Or are you creating these transactions first on your own?
<@!788215642070581289> ?
How to can i update the metadata of NFT created by the splToken program ?
It needs to be offline
`getParsedConfirmedTransactions` will attempt to parse the details that it can. https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getParsedConfirmedTransactions
Any usable function that i can use from the SDK to parse TransactionIntructions objects? I need to be able to see the type like in the RPC calls response
Gave response on my end
Full code:
```
const connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com', 'confirmed');

  const block = await connection._rpcRequest(
    'getBlock',
    [
      106247556,
      {
        "commitment": "confirmed",
        "encoding": "base64",
        "transactionDetails": "full",
        "rewards": false
      }
    ]
  )
  console.log(JSON.stringify(block));
```
What do you mean non-trable indices?
```
{
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  result: null,
}
```
Huh that doesn't give me a rsponse
Hi, is there something like umaproject for Solana specifically to create tracking tokens for non-tradable indices?
Spoke with internal team. Looks like you can pull from the accountsdb and write a filter for the specific accounts you want.
Here's an example plugin for postgres https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/accountsdb-plugin-postgres
is solana created on substate node template?
It should fail as it needs to balance
Or how much sol I need to mint one nft?
I‚Äôm on mainnet and already replenished the balance
it is causing problem today itself üò¶
Thanks <@!788215642070581289>
but it worked other day
ok let me try
you have insufficient sol, try to airdrop if you are not on main net
`sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.8.2/install)"`
downgrade to 1.8.2 and try your origin action again. it should work
I sent you a friend request
Can anyone help me with this?
`solana-cli 1.9.0 (src:devbuild; feat:2420900513)`, every method return this, airdrop, deploy etc
maybe give me your phantom wallet address or dm me. I can take a look for it.
Now the wallet is in a broken state
I don't know what I did I posted the code I ran above
I tried restoring my wallet from seed phrase same error
```rust
    vault_info.lamports.borrow_mut() -= amount;
    destination_info.lamports.borrow_mut() += amount/2;
```
if both of this account are owned by a program and it only adds half amount of lamports to other account, will to the remaining `amount/2` lamport be burned or the transaction will fail
which method you are using? and also want to know what it prints when you `solana --version`
mint account also need to sign this tx because it was created. you can use partialSign to do
I want people to go to my website and lock up an nft for a few days. After that they will be recieving a reward for locking those nft's up. How would I go about making such a system so that they can lock and unlock their nft's on my website?
nft is a mint so you can use token transfer to send it.
https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/tour/token-transfer.html
So somehow I changed the state of my wallet
I get the same error
<@788215642070581289> when I try to do a basic operation now like send 1 sol using phantom wallet
https://docs.solana.com/offline-signing/durable-nonce
https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/advanced/durable-nonce/
Only system account can pay tx fee.
Guys ?
`Error: RPC response error -32601: Method not found`  Why am i getting this, and how to resolve it ?
My wallet seems to be corrupted now?
I can't do anything with it
I just get this error "This account may not be used to pay transaction fees"
Can't send money out of it
I was messing around with the SDK trying to send a transaction and somehow it got into this state
I ran this code
```    let keypair = Keypair.generate();

      });
      let keys = [{pubkey: wallet.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true}];
      let params = { space: 100 };

      let allocateStruct = {
        index: 8,
        layout: struct([
          u32('instruction'),
          ns64('space'),
        ])
      };

      let data = Buffer.alloc(allocateStruct.layout.span);
      let layoutFields = Object.assign({instruction: allocateStruct.index}, params);
      allocateStruct.layout.encode(layoutFields, data);

      allocateTransaction.add(new TransactionInstruction({
        keys,
        programId: SystemProgram.programId,
        data,
      }));

    allocateTransaction.feePayer = wallet.publicKey;
    const resp = await connection.getRecentBlockhash();
    const blockhash = resp.blockhash;
    allocateTransaction.recentBlockhash = blockhash;
    
    if (blockhash) {
      console.log({ allocateTransaction });
      let signed = await wallet.signTransaction(allocateTransaction);
      let signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(signed.serialize());
      //   console.log({ signed });
      //   console.log({ transaction });
      //   console.log("Transaction sent - " + signature);
    } else {
      console.log("Failed to get blockhash. Transaction not sent.");
    }```
How to fix this error?
// create a mint account
    let mint = Keypair.generate();
    console.log(`mint: ${mint.publicKey.toBase58()}`);

    let instructions = [

Are nft tokens different from normal tokens? Is it possible to transfer multiple nfts in one instruction?
What are nonce accounts?
Does Solana have Composable Tokens like ERC-998 in Ethereum ?
Executable accounts can't have their balance changed? Even if the changes increases the balance?
Somehow I corrupted my account by sending transactions
thank you all, hahaha üôÇ
Anyone gotten this error before "This account may not be used to pay transaction fees"?
oh... just found it in sources: type MintInfo -> decimals ! so... probably I need to use getMintInfo()
I made transaction for custom token and use 666 as amount but in transaction I got 0.000000666 (9 digits by default) so where can I get this value (9) for specific token?
hey, we are using constant LAMPORTS_PER_SOL to operate with SOL, but how we can get such multiplier for SPL Tokens? I guess I saw some structure that reflects that decimal digit but can not find/remember it
Can someone please help me with deployment on devnet. Getting this error when deploying (anchor deploy) the build code on devnet. And I keep getting the same error even after following the recover instructions -

This is how validators can handle many thousands of transactions per second. There's also a fixed limit (of computational units) that custom programs can use.
No, the computational usage is a very small fixed amount for the core programs.
It does not depend on the computation usage?
A regular `transfer` transaction will cost `0.000005 SOL` (5000 lamports). This fee is per-signature, so some types of transaction (for example creating a stake account) that require multiple signatures will cost some multiple of that value. You can see the fees with `solana fees` which gives:
```Blockhash: 2KX1sHJ21KZA7UcmFLDSDnmZMF5FYqCh7DhvWSHvTyXd
Lamports per signature: 5000
Last valid block height: 95688036```
How to know in advance from the client side how much a transaction will cost?
Everyone! Could you give me some way of publishing NFTs onto store ?? üòÆ with w3 library Thank you
you can take a look at how token account design.  https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/state.rs#L90
There is a site contains some examples for spl-token, you can take a look https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/tour/create-mint.html
yes. basically these two case can use the same account but I think you can use testnet to ensure it first
`invoke_signed` find the right account_info which matched instruction.

I solve it myself.

I think the order of account_info is not important.
Yep - so your program needs to make that decision... it could a) check the signature of your white-list account and go "that's good enough for me, I know only the real whitelist maintainer could have signed this" or it could b) Check the actual whitelist itself, directly, stored in a PDA, and know to continue or not based on that.
The minting process should continue if the address is whitelisted , end the program if not
There is a NFT Minting process on that so I cant implemt this solution ü§î
The second parameter is array of AccountInfo. 
I can't understand the order of accountInfo.
I mean calling `invoke()`

Do guys know why we should code like this?
No , https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/spl-token Documentation of this lib ?
Is this what you want? <https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-reference>?
No - on-chain programs must run quickly on the validators. All information must be passed in to them... but you could have an off-chain program that signs a transaction in addition to the user, and your off-chain program would only provide its signature if the address was white-listed. This is how you could implement an off-chain whitelist (if that's how you chose to do it).
Hi Guys

Where Can I find js version of @solana/spl-token documentation?
There is no Oracle required ?
So with solana its possible call an off-chain program from the on-chain program ?
you can lookat the record program in the solana program library github.  it has example of authority and constraint check to allow only auth to save data.
No - I just made this approach up in response to your question. Architecting appropriate solutions is something that comes with experience as a developer. I don't know if what I suggested is the *best* way, as I only have the information you supplied, depending on your use-case it might even be possible to do all the white-list operations off-chain (i.e. have an off-chain program that your on-chain program requires a signature from in order to succeed).
Thank you very much , do you have any link of somenthing that I can study on ?
(you probably want a bit more data than that so that you can store the authority address and change it too)
You can have a program account and store the data in there - give yourself authority to write to it so that you can change the whitelist via your program (similar to stake program). You'd need to keep about 0.14 SOL in that account to stay above rent-exemption and store 600*32-bytes.
That is, whoever the program assigned account represents
In the hello world example, it seems that anyone can run the transaction to say hello to an account. But what if my transaction is a game state, and only the account owner should be able to run the transaction?
Hi , guys I'm trying to implement a kind of WhiteList in my Solana Program.
What Im trying to do is hard coding a list of Addresses (600 addresses) into a Vector of Strings, when the user interact with the Porgram I comprare the Payer address with my address vector , everything its fine , and working , but only with a small whitelist , with the 600 addresses whitelist I'm getting this error `Access violation in stack frame 1 at address of size 8 by instruction solana` .
So I started to learn how the Solana Stack works and I know now that is 4KB only , doo you have any suggestion on how ti implement a whitelist based on Addresses ?
Thanks guys
Yes, but I suggest if you think the data-structure will ever change again, add versioning to it. Usually the first byte or two would be good, to indicate the version, but you could also use the size I think (for your first migration)
I have an account like this üëÜ and another question is - does rent get deducted *without* a transaction? I see the balance is less than the previous post-tx-deposit amount, but no additional tx.
What happens if a an account which is the stake-authority and withdraw-authority for a stake-account has less than the min-rent, and epoch-rent gets taken, and then eventually there isn't enough for the rent?
The answer is right there in your screenshot - 2nd line of the program log.
<@!788215642070581289> so in case of 1a & 2a, I can continue using same account, just add to/remove from end of struct and it should be fine?
There are some possible when you struct changed.
1. your struct bigger than before
    a) your origin account size can store the data you added
    b) your origin account size can't store it.
2. your struct smaller than before
    a) your struct's member's order not changed
    b) your struct's member order changed.
3. you adjust your struct's member order

for 1b, 2b and 3, you have to add a migration in your program to switch user's ori account to new account.
What happens if I need to update the data structure stored in a program. But there's already accounts with data stored. Can I just add variables to the end of my Borsh struct or not? Can I add a second Borsh struct?

nft metadata includes url are store in a metadata account data field, and the metadata account address is a pda address,  so you can get the address easy
Did not understood .From ethereums perspective we used to   pass metadataIUrl  to mintToken method & after tokenid was generated  _setTokenURI was invoked .How is it happening in token program .Where are we providing metadataURl .Thanks in advance .
is there smart contract for dao
the metadata account address is a pda address generated from mint address, so you can get it and parse and get the url
Hey guys ,
How do  i store nft created via token program to nft metadata .Is there some function in token program or i have to use a new account.data to store tokenid->metadata url relation ?

It takes too long to get all nfts by using 'getTokenAccountsByOwner' if  the owner get 100 nfts

So the wallet-adapter has everything you need to connect to multiple wallets. If you want pure vanilla js, you may need to do a little extra work. Check out the adapters though https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/blob/master/packages/wallets/phantom/src/adapter.ts
Hopefully going to change in the future
I've heard windows support on test validator isn't exactly there. Would recommend WSL for windows to run the test validator

So I believe this WS-based subscribers way is how they're doing it over at Metaplex right now, with tens of thousands of accounts. I'm not sure if their is a better way if you have your own non voting validator though. I'll ask internally.
is getting blocks out of order
My main concern
Also what is serum?
rn I'm using 'root'
Also what event do I need to listen to?
How can I take advantage of that?
Hello, my program has tens of thousands of accounts it owns and controls. What is the recommended way for querying their data for off-chain processing? I'm aware of the WS-based subscribers that get notified about changes, but for getting the initial state of those accounts I think that invoking a JSON-based RPC might not be a good idea. I'm in a position to have my own non-voting validator. Maybe some type of direct access to the underlying rocksdb? or maybe something else?
Looks like there may not be something better at this time. base64 encoded should be the quickest because it is the lowest response size though
?
that I can use
is there something better
Yes. I believe json should be pretty fast though
Os that what you mean by encoding?
when I could be getting it as something packed
am I getting it as json
wait
wiat
and the getblock method
I'm using @solana/web3.js

What encoding are you using?
Huh strange
Also, I used the private-but-free genesysgo node and was getting ~200ms avg responses for `getBlock`

I don't get limited
but at least
its still kinda slow
I just gained access to the private-but-free genesysgo node
Recommend getting your own rpc like genesysgo, quicknode, or triton
You can use a combination of slotSubscribe + getBlock. You're likely impacted by your rpc though if you're just using the mainnet-beta rpc.
but not be a validator
and get all of the transactions and blocks
Is there a way I can simply 'listen' to the network
Is there a way I can improve throughput?
Sorry what is serum?
The way you're doing it will work. It's a ton of data though. Serum alone generates something like 8gb every minute, which would explain why it takes so long depending on your internet connection
to get a block
to a second and a half
but it takes like a second
I've been using the rpc
What is the best way to get every block as it is confirmed onto the network?
üëã High everyone!
Ok, trying through the Git desktop now
I've heard others having similar issues because windows has different new line characters

Just a direct import without modules and exports. Something like this for the solana web3 library: https://unpkg.com/@solana/web3.js@latest/lib/index.iife.js
It should be compatible with most frameworks. What compatibility are you looking for?

I think I might be doing authority wrong, I'm adding a new account for that. But also debugging invoke _signed is pretty opaque

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

ah yes ofc, thanks <a:drunk:895069949314342974> üòÑ
Thanks Jon!
You'd have to do a `getProgramAccounts` with that user's pubkey as the withdraw authority.  Here's an example: https://github.com/solana-labs/stake-o-matic/blob/b46765d49d370c6d8c0fc96371f7ae5bac4fa44f/bot/src/rpc_client_utils.rs#L299
Ok, thank you !
I was doing on command line and had to pass blockhash and signer - the defaults would probably use a new blockhash I guess and it means it will use the same one that was in the signed tx
Hello there, is that possible to get all the stake accounts associated to an account? In my program, I create several stake accounts for a user, and I'd like to know if I can get this list of accounts from the user's account.
I don't think there's a particular best practice there, it's up to you.  If you do it with a pda, you can more easily derive the account address in your client / js code.  On the flip side, you'll be limited to 10kb of data in the pda account vs 10mb in the non-pda
Huh. It's weird, though. After I get the error, I pass the blockhash to $ solana block-time and I get a timestamp. Maybe I'm reserializing the transaction wrong. I'll check that.
You can dig further into the code -- `Account::unpack` does a check to make sure it's initialized
Ok, thank. But what's the best practice, use a pda or not ?
You can just create something like this: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/bf7ad18f41d5878050128c6c3f3412fb581d9e46/token/js/client/layout.js#L8
Hey -- I'm looking at https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L669 

if the account frozen has not been initialized this fails right?
That's exactly right, so you have two options:
* account == pda: you must do `create_account` with `invoke_signed` within your program
* account != pda: you must do `create_account` and sign with the private key. the standard way is to have one transaction that does `create_account` and then `initialize` in your program to actually write data
I think the error message is different (blockhash too old) if it's too old. so it's not that. Also I've successfully obtained a recent blockhash, written it to USB, changed the stick over to airgapped machine, signed, trnasferred back, and submitted the tx - so you should have enough time. I think you get about 12-16s
You'll need to have the owner of the USDT token account sign a transfer to move funds back
thanks!
Yep, it's `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` everywhere!
Hi. I'm trying to implement a payer server that adds the payer signature to a transaction and relays it to the network. I keep getting "Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found" when I broadcast the tx. I imagine this is because the recent blockhash is too old, but it can't be more than a second or so between getting the block hash and finally calling sendTransaction. Is there something else I might be missing?
If I need to pass a public key into an instruction, which type do I use from @solana/buffer-layout to create the instruction in JS?
of the spl-token program to be clear
hello, is the token program id the same on testnet, mainnet and devnet?
im trying to find a way whereby i can generate wallet addresses, and give it to each of my users to deposit USDT
however how do i transfer the funds back?
Hi, i generated public and secret key using Js, and sent some USDT and i can clearly see the token in solana explorer
So state account pubkey must be on curve or it should be a pda ? If it must be a pda it mean we can only create them from the SC right ? because we can't sign from client
Thank you, i couldn't sure about that. I hope it will be merged in asap. Before, we got merged easily but things can happen, thank you again.
Your latest commit already got tagged for automerge. Just wait
Looks like you already got merged https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/commit/6eeddc61cdc141fbbb760f08e7be9defc27eba3c
Yeah, doesn't look like you'll be able to do it with phantom. People did it back then when it was required to receive airdrops. Not sure if Phantom was available then
sorry for the mention but could you give me some advice <@!489206164270350337>?
I think with Sollet, when you add the SPL token it takes 0.00000X out of your balance to pay for the add. But with Phantom, as far as we know it doesn't üò¶
Not that I am aware of. You'd have to build it yourself
Hey <@!489206164270350337> thanks for the reply. Is there a script already out there that may do what we need?
token name is Sphinxel SPX. i didn't get any error before but i really exhausted maybe it can be easy thing but i'm missing that.
hello, i've just updated our coingeckoid. it's already passed all checks but it's still open, not merged. is there any advice guys? thanks!
Oh i got it, `createProgramAddress` throw an error if it's on the curve, `findProgramAddres` try again until it find one. Thank you !
yes good point , filecoin has a constant trx overhead for every i/o
Ok, it add a  nonce as a seed. I understand what it does but i don't understand the purpose of it
I believe solsea is also using metaplex for nfts. If this is the case, they're still using arweave
If they store everything in some config, I expect you may be able to. Check with metaplex https://discord.gg/metaplex
You can see the source of each here:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/master/src/publickey.ts#L142
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/master/src/publickey.ts#L173
Both must be off curve
nice , i was using Solsea as a study case , i assume all those nfts are stored on a local running ipfs node, locally run by solsea that is
Hello, is It possible to know before what token I am going to receive from  a candy machine? If not how do they randomize It?
I solved it by adding partialsign function
You can store information on accounts, however there is a 10MB account limit. You could also store references to things like Arweave, which is what I believe what metaplex does
And so, difference between `findProgramAddress` and `createProgramAddress`  when given the same params, they don't give the same off curve address ?
btw how do you handle backend DB stuff for solana ? is something like filecoin or ipfs used ?
lamports are the smallest unit of SOL. Like SATs to Bitcoin, or wei to ethereum
or share links
can you explain what are lamports (i am noob)
It is in lamports
or in sol?
it it balance in $?
guys i dont understand the balance value when using getBalance method
cheers , friend
A lot of people are using Anchor as a framework to write programs on solana. For integrating websites with wallets, you can use the wallet-adapter https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter
Looking for ways to read data on Solana, check out the json rpc https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api
You can also go through figment's learning path for Solana https://learn.figment.io/pathways/solana-pathway
thanks im sort of learning solana dev at the moment , thinking of a platform that makes it easy to integrate solana wallets , write rust contracts  ,etc , hope im more clear
Not too sure on moralis
infura is just a network provider, right?
user accounts vs program
Correct
Is there a development platform to build stuff on solana ? Im looking for something like infura or moralis ?
Oh, `createWithSeed` is on curve and not the other right ?
‚ö†Ô∏è  DISCLAIMER: I don't ask to merge my token üòÑ

Hi,

I did a PR for make some changes to our token: https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/4080
Is it possible to merge it or have any ETA? üôÇ

I also did an issue, I think you should provide `automerge` feature for edits, not only add: https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/issues/4081
Hi, what's the difference between `createProgramAddress` and `createWithSeed`, when do you use one or the other ? Thank you
The byte code is BPF which can be disassembled to BPF source using LLVM or gcc tools. If you read BPF source then you are in luck
Hey guys, I was wondering if I could have a program itself sign an invoked_signed.
thank you very much
I don't believe you can prevent the users from executing the original transfer function. However, you can create mechanics around your wrapper to incentivize using the wrapper
You can see how token-swap wraps the transfer function here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token-swap/program/src/processor.rs#L138
Program souce is here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/program
ohhh interesting
<@!785084693023424542>
You could create a contract wrapper to SPL, but you could still invoke the original spl instructions
thank you very much. Is there some sort of documentation / resource you can think of if I want to "use SPL as a base and create custom functionality"
custom functionality while possible is not currently supported by the SPL spec or for use in the general ecosystem.  you could create custom func based in SPL spec but it would not be supported out of the box for everyone.  otherwise you can use SPL as a base and create custom functionality. This is the current state and implementations are evolving.
Once it's deployed you can look at the bytecode and figure out what it does. I've never done this, so no idea if there are decompilation tools etc. but would be surprised if there wasn't already info on this available.
You can get the original receivers to initialize the spl token account in their wallet. It was done this way originally, however it may not be as successful now.

Another way you could do it is host a website that has a bunch of signed transactions already ready to execute, just with the payer as the receiver. The receivers could then visit the website, sign and execute the transaction and receive your airdrop.

Ultimately rent isn't that much for 2000 users, and going the convenient way may build a better community in the long run.
bump. I think this is likely an easy answer for one of yall - just lmk where to look.  thx
you can pay the initialization fee for the recipients
I get that, but users of some of my stuff want to skip pre-flight (they have good reasons, honest) and I'd like to be able to provide equivalent error-logging. Given a load-balanced RPC server, null from `getTransaction` can just mean it hasn't made it to that particular server yet (and 100ms later it has).

I'm stuck trying to find out what happened to a submitted transaction, that has returned a signature, that errors before it is added to the chain. Anyone know how?
for me, when I get null from `getTransaction` then I will do https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#simulatetransaction
to check my tx is health or not. if I can't pass the simulation, I will do error handle.
Yeah, it's the error-handling for that situation I'm trying to write though! How do I know I sent a stale blockhash if the signature never returns anything from `getTransaction` or `getSignatureStatuses`? How can I see an error in that situation other than watching a `null` response for 30 seconds?
great thanks this is a good start
here are the web3 calls you can use to get data and subscribe to events https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html
if you get `BlockhashNotFound` error, you should get a recent blockhash again or chain will reject your tx.
just linked to you for future reference if someone else asks

when you receive some sol you can get the data from chain.

Hello world: https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld
i have same issue...
Hi!
Is there a way to get Signer's `Pubkey` from `Signature` if i know message that was signed. There is `solana_sdk::secp256k1_recover`, but not for ed25519 that  used in Solana.
Hi, please suggest me some beginners tutorials to get started with Solana development. 
I tried escrow program, but I couldn't understand most of the stuff in there.
I also tried "Building Solana Smart-contracts and dApps with James Bachini" on SolHack, but this too was little too advance for me.

guys, how i sign a tx with sol-wallet-adapter?
cant get account info of newly generated wallets in mainnet-beta why?
Resolved: this was an Anchor version problem.
I need help with this please. The docs doesn‚Äôt have code snippets to show how this should be done.

Hi everyone, My name is Precious.
I'm currently having difficulties fetching tokens from a solana account.I need help please
I was hoping to move from evm dev to sealevel but this is all off-putting. Somebody please show me how I am mistaken
Crypto has thrived because it has monetized open source development. Afaict, Solana labs is the only player open sourcing their work
Also a huge issue for the ecosystem. No code sharing. I want sealevel to succeed as a runtime but can't see that happening if projects don't open source their code
its so confusing
honestly dont know why im having that issue
yep
It is a big security issue. Hard to trust a project with my found if the code is closed source and there is no audit
can someone please check <#694949720644124762>
Big security question there eh? One would hope they would all be open source but even that is not entirely trustable. I know of no reputable verifiable credential issuer for this
The only ones I see are in the doc reference I sent you
Do most Solana projects keep their contract code closed source?
So, we have a token called $DIRT. We need to airdrop 1000 of these tokens to 1000 people (wallets). This is simple... but it's costing 0.00204428 SOL for each transaction, which is ~$0.46.

Therefore, to send 1000 transactions will be about 2.04428 SOL.
Plus, every day we'll be sending about 2000 transactions - 1 token to every NFT holder, and 10 tokens to NFTs with certain traits.
 
The problem we have is that we _think_ the initial transaction costs 0.00204428 SOL because it costs SOL to add a SPL token to an address. Thereafter it's very cheap. So for example:

Transaction 1 - 0.00204428
Transaction 2 - 0.0000001
Transaction 3 - 0.0000001
etc

What we're trying to figure out is:

a) whether we can get airdroppers (the ones that are getting the tokens for free), to pay to initialize their wallet. i.e. they pay the 0.00204428

b) ... or if there is a cheaper way of doing it.

The NFT holders, we'll be paying for their 'initialization' because they minted an NFT. But for people that are getting free tokens, we'd like to get them to pay the initialization fee.

Again, sorry if this is the wrong channel.

what this error means:
```
Attempt to debit an account but found no record of a prior credit.
```
?
Is there a way to get sth like `logsSubscribe` but that returns the transaction instructions rather than the log? Or at least a transaction id? I wanna follow all transactions that involve a given account.
(`getSignatureStatuses` also just returns null for it.)
If I submit a transaction with a stale blockhash, I get a `BlockhashNotFound` error because preflight catches it. If I skip preflight though, I don't get that error (obviously) but nor does the returned transaction signature ever appear when I call `getTransaction`. Again that's not unexpected. But: how do I check on the returned signature to find out what happened to it?
any ideas?
also tried:
```
const { blockhash } = await connection.getRecentBlockhash('max');
        const txParam: TransactionInstruction[] = [SystemProgram.transfer({
            fromPubkey: publicKey,
            toPubkey: new PublicKey('CdoFMmSgkhKGKwunc7TusgsMZjxML6kpsvEmqpVYPjyP'),
            lamports: 10000,
          })]

        let transaction: Transaction = new Transaction({ feePayer: publicKey, recentBlockhash: blockhash }).add(...txParam);
        transaction = await signTransaction(transaction);

        const rawTransaction = transaction.serialize({ requireAllSignatures: false });
        const txid = await sendAndConfirmRawTransaction( connection, rawTransaction,{commitment:'max'});
```
```

        const transaction = new Transaction().add(
            SystemProgram.transfer({
                fromPubkey: publicKey,
                toPubkey: Keypair.generate().publicKey,
                lamports: 1,
            })
        );

        const signature = await sendTransaction(transaction, connection);

        await connection.confirmTransaction(signature, 'processed');
```
Hope this isn't too far off-topic. I'm having trouble with `anchor test`. Any ideas what's behind
```
FetchError: request to http://localhost:8899/ failed, reason: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:8899
```
It's possible to listen incoming transaction to address with websocket? 
I've search the docs but it's only available to subscribe on change slot, signature, program and account data/value
the thing is that I already have the structure for decoding, which is 
```
const structure = borsh.struct([
    borsh.publicKey("key")
]);
```
I'm just trying to revert the decode() function using the encode() function, but it doesn't seem to work
how are you constructing this?
but yep, I think you direct me in right way, I think this tweetnacl package is what I need, thanks
if you are taking borsh, maybe you can take a look how metaplex serialize their data
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/js/packages/cli/src/types.ts#L230-L241
so I want to store specific data using public key that will be available only for secret key holder. something like that
> it looks like some nodes are falling behind due to heavy network load right now.  Please check your node status
What is "my node" and how to check it's status?
hm.. not yet. we have ed25519 keypairs, right for every wallet, pair of public and secret keys which are proper asymmetric keys. normally they used for signing messages inside transaction, but we can encrypt and decrypt any data with asymmetric keys, isn't it?
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/web3.js/src/keypair.ts#L69 are you looking for this?
not sure what you really want to do but sounds like you need some ed25519 lib to help you to do
I've the following problem: 
I'm trying to understand how the borsh structure method "encode".
I'm decoding data from a hex string using a certain structure, but when I try to come back to the hex string using the "encode" method it returns just "32" intead of the hex string 

```
const dataBuffer = Buffer.from("3f82e912081de01dea18aa96d102ef37130e77252e115115d2f88c18f291a8e3","hex") 

const structure = borsh.struct([
    borsh.publicKey("key")
]);

const decodedKey = structure.decode(dataBuffer).key.toString()

console.log(structure.encode(decodedKey)) //prints "32", why?

// why it doesn't return 
//3f82e912081de01dea18aa96d102ef37130e77252e115115d2f88c18f291a8e3 ?
```
you can assign a PDA (not program) as a freeze authority of a mint. that is workable.
<@!788215642070581289> oh! good day. I am trying to implement data encryption/decription using ed25519 Keypair but can't get any examples, maybe you already know one? tho there're lot of samles with RSA
that's depends on how program deserialize it.
give you some examples
for token program https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/instruction.rs#L583-L586
for metaplex program https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/rust/token-metadata/program/src/processor.rs#L45-L47
so the main idea is how program serialize and deserialize
maybe you can dig into these functions then you will know how to do it
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/SystemInstruction.html#decodeTransfer
if you use set-authority, the account you can't use anymore after that.

Hello! What is the best way to monitor the transaction involving an account without spamming the endpoints? Something like push notifications when sth happens?
a signer?
does any 1 know how to setup a signer in https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter?
Hi, I am newbie in web developer. I never dev any website before but I wanna try dev on Solana chain. If I learn and follow on <#763249718339567626> .Is that enough? or anyone have resources that I should learn more? Please suggest me. Thanks!
ps. I have some basic programing languages  blockchain Defi and NFT.
hello! I'm building an app which involves temporarily not allowing users to trade their SPL tokens. is there a way for a mint's freeze authority to be set to another program? I basically want to freeze and unfreeze particular users' token accounts based on their interactions with my app's program
does anyone know how to build instruction data by knowing structure and input data?
How to parsing this data buffer? I use web3js but there's no a hint to do that

whats the difference betweem doing a spl-token transfer and set-authority (Account Owner) to the person u want to transfer to?
guys, does any 1 have a working example for integrating wallet on react like:
https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/
or any other wallet plugin?
btw, thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
well then it seems a bit strange task for me üôÇ blockchain means connection to Internet, this is dApp!
there're couple of examples for signing offline but in the end it still assume some final interaction with network, basically sending transaction, so...
or by Delegate
the app is restricted to run without the internet, so I am finding the solution that can run without the internet üò¶
I think you need: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountsbyowner
yes it is
oh you mean these auxiliary keypairs? few addresses for same token for single base account?
Meanwhile getAssociatedTokenAddress only returns one of them
Solana account may have more than one token account address for specify mint address.
I don't think so, associatedProgramId is ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
why not? in `getAssociatedTokenAddress()` you pass associatedProgramId (actually mint public key) so you will get derived wallet exactly for specific token
I know that I can generate token account address by using getAssociatedTokenAddress, but in case of the owner have many token accounts, it wouldn't work
hello, If I have an owner address, token account address and mint address, could I verify that owner is correct in offline?
ok, happy to help a bit üôÇ
ive lierally spent all day looking for this
cheers!
keypairs -- is ABC of the crypto world! üôÇ we MUST know where we save it, and MUST keep it safe and secure! it's like passport or... DNA idk üôÇ some very basic and super important little things!
thank you so much
just logged in and the addresses match
thank you so muhc!
but when i tried seraching with commands it said the files didnt exist
oh.. ok. so just check its content if is is sequence of numbers in square brackets than it's probably your key!
and file
i literally went 1 by 1 in every folder
the file was just named ~
hidden???
for some reason it was in a file ~
you know what, i think i got it
well. maybe you have changed this specific settings previously with something like `solana config set --keypair <\path\to\keypair.json>`
last thing you can try is to search all json files and check em all one by one manually (this will be headache, defo)
i ran it directly from windows
?
hm.. not yet. seems windows don't understand tilda (~) at all. did you run your command directly from Windows or its WSL subsystem (windows-linux)
hmm i get an error when i type that code
hm.. well you can try to run command `type ~/config/solana/devnet-test.json`
<@!641799492273963009>
i try to look up the keypair path but nothing is there
this is what i get when i run the command
Config File: C:\Users\David\.config\solana\cli\config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com 
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)

hi mates!
how can i get all exhibited nft on the all marketplaces?
then you will see something like:
```
blabla\solana>solana config get
Config File: C:\Users\SomeUser\.config\solana\cli\config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: \Tools\solana-wallet\keypair.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

Keypair Path -- is where your initial and default keypair is stored
When I sign into phantom
Weird. It doesn‚Äôt work for me it just generates a new address and the wallet is empty
as I mentioned before you can check your default config using `solana config get`

idk, I just created phantom wallet today from my generated keypair, all was good:
I‚Äôll try to view the hidden files and see if I can find the file if not I‚Äôll try and do it on a mac
Which is why I think it‚Äôs weird I cannot ever login to the correct wallet on chrome extension
Yeah I did use solana cli
well... have no idea what you did with vscode, normally people use official Solana tools like solana-cli + spl-token-cli if you generated keypair programmatically it's your responsibility to store all these keys somewhere
That‚Äôs about it tbh so when I login to a wallet through chrome extension and type in the seedphrase and password it shows a different address so I‚Äôm trying to login to a specific address on phantom or solflare wallet
Well I created the address with vscode and it generated a new public key and gave me a pass phrase and I entered the password I wanted
also keep in mind if you create wallet with passphrase+password it will be different than wallet created with only passphrase
don't forget that a lot of folders in %USERPROFILE% dir are hidden so if you use standard windows explorer with default settings it will never show you these files
And I need the correct address
So I‚Äôm stuck with logging into wallets w the seed phrase but the correct address is not coming up
I‚Äôve been trying to search my computer for the file and cannot find it at all
Well the thing is, when I try to use the seed phrase to login to a wallet it generates a different address and I wanna locate the json file to login through the codes numbers <@641799492273963009>
I've read it, but i can't find how to decode it
it's probably one of the key you already generated and only you know where is it
but devnet-test.json is something not related to default solana cli configs at all
~ is %USERPROFILE%
Can anyone tell me where ~/config/solana/devnet-test.json is located in windows? I cannot find that file for the life of me
<@!837895290723106836> https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/transactions#instruction-format
Is there any example for how to decode instruction in transaction like solscan did?

Hello folks, newbie to blockchains in general and Solana in particular. I had some very basic questions before I started digging into the Solana docs. Okay to ask here?
Hello, I am trying to make an SPL token with custom transfer function. Imagine a classic shitcoin - "1% of every transaction is burned". Can anyone direct me to some resources that can answer this question? Theres a ton of info about creating an SPL token - but none include how to add custom features to the transfer function, etc
ppl, I want to use some cryptography to encrypt/decrypt data and solana web3.js already has some cryptographic functions out of the box, but it would be even better if I can use user keypairs for that, is there any examples how to encrypt/decrupt some data using solana keypairs? should be simple code snippet I guess
check paths from `solana config get` and `where solana` I guess it should be enough to remove that and as well check your generated keys if you store them in specific places
Anyone?
ah yes, `MetadataDataData` üòÜ
okay sweet it worked! missing piece was the associated token account creation
thanks!
hmm okay
it will failed if you call for account already created.
so you will need to check is ATA exist or not
is creating a associated token account idempotent? Can I call the instruction when it already exists, or will it error?
https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/tour/create-token-account.html 
the method 2 is how to create an ATA.
and you can just append it before token transfer instruction.
token transfer: https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/tour/token-transfer.html
It's definitely possible for NPM packages to be malicious and read local data. Pre/post-install hooks can run arbitrary executables on your machine. A simple Docker container can help with sandboxing.
also seeing that the CLI is creating a associated token account if that doesn't exist yet, didn't know that has to be done explicitly as well üòÖ
actually when your use transfer, you have to pass token account into it (from and to).
you can use getAccountInfo to retrieve mint back. mint is stored in the token account.
how does the unchecked variant derive the mint? through associated token account source?
yup. transfer and transferChecked is the same thing but transferChecked make mint and decimals explicit.
ok the CLI is using both - https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/cli/src/main.rs#L706-L726
`createTransferCheckedInstruction` on the other hand has both source and owner which I had assumed would be the same
a bit confused why `createTransferInstruction` from spltoken doesn't take a token mint hash?
there is `createTransferCheckedInstruction` though
a quick question, I'm trying to find the token instruction in the spltoken javascript package, but `createTransferInstruction` in there doesn't take a mint
"the system cannont find the file specified"
yooo can anyone help me setup a file wallet
So, I've never really used npm/node much, but I know it relies on a huge library of packages - if any of these are sketchy would that only affect sites built with it, or could they potentially read your ssh keys from your local machine, and whatever else? Or does it always run in a jail automatically? Should it be installed in a VM?
any idea how to uninstall solana from my computer to wipe everything completely. On windows
Is the governance program deployed? It seems like Oyster/mvp-governance just lets you pass in a governance program as an ID. 

Is there a reason one might deploy their own copy of the governance program rather than use `GovER5Lthms3bLBqWub97yVrMmEogzX7xNjdXpPPCVZw` that seems to be the default in `mvp-governance` ?
Got it, thanks! Yes, I guess I will run it with EC2 in the end, I was thinking about using other available servers
Not sure what exact issue you are facing, in general, one use `gce.sh` to create cluster, and use `net.sh` to config/start/stop validators. For exmaple: 
```
cd net/
# create a gce cluster with 5 validators and one client
./gce.sh create -p testnet-dev-$(whoami) -n 5 -c 1 --self-destruct-hours 10
./init-metrics.sh $(whoami) 
# start the validators and the client
./net.sh start --allow-private-addr -c "bench-tps=1=--tx_count 5000 --thread-batch-sleep-ms 250"
# check validator status
./ssh.sh
# restart the whole cluster
./net.sh restart --allow-private-addr -c "bench-tps=1=--tx_count 5000 --thread-batch-sleep-ms 250"
# Stop running processes on all nodes
./net.sh stop 
# delete gce cluster
./gce.sh delete -p testnet-dev-$(whoami)
```
Not 100% sure how `colo.sh` works though
How can I depend on it?
I want to write a dApp that depends on `curve25519-dalek`. I tried putting it under `dependencies`, but when I run `anchor build`, I get
`error: target is not supported`
But then I saw that `solana-program` also depends on it:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/Cargo.toml#L41

What's going on here? What does `[target.'cfg(not(target_arch = "bpf"))'.dependencies]` mean?
hey, for associated token program, you take X + Y + Z = A.
I'm looking to swap this around to get X from A + Y + Z = X.
Currently I'm doing getprogramaccounts -> get largest token accounts -> get account info -> owner. Is there a more intelligent solution?
I wonder if <@!585868308419444749> or <@!830175075817750598> can provide any details, as they seem to have mentioned this script in the chat history
Does anyone know what's wrong with that?
```

okay cool, I'll check it out, thanks
https://spl.solana.com/memo this I assume
You could use the memo program to accomplish on chain messages
does anyone know if its possible to write or sign a custom message on-chain? Like somehow add the string "Hello World" somewhere in a transaction or in an on-chain signed message? In a way that it can be read later.
Not too sure on your specific request, as I've never run those scripts myself. I would expect you may have to update the `net/gce.sh` if you're running into issues. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be much docs surrounding them except for the scripts themselves
Thank you! Well, that's the thing, that gce can run for different providers, and the one for private servers, colo, seems to have peculiarities
Not sure on other chain's bridges. Likely there's a kusama->ethereum bridge you could use to hop to Solana
Not too sure how the servers are prepared. Looks like the `net/gce.sh` creates the nodes and `net/net.sh` will create the local clusters on those nodes. You can check how the nodes are prepared in `net/gce.sh`
Yeah.. I know about wormhole. But they don't support dot. Is there any development going on for such a bridge ? What about bridging Solana to some other chain and then to Kusama ??
Wormhole has a bunch of bridges. Doesn't look like they support DOT today
No way to get previous state to my knowledge
You could do something with Step's staking pool https://github.com/step-finance/reward-pool and update to reward holders with a different token. That's an idea
<@!489206164270350337> Do you know how the colo servers are expected to be prepared before the script is run? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/net Because on one hand, the script should create `solana` user on the server, but on the other hand the scripts connect to the servers as `solana` users initially
Thank you! I really appreciate it
You can use `getSIgnaturesForAddress` and `getTransaction` https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress
I'm not sure how you could restrict, but check out these examples of spl token wrappers for more info:
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/rust/token-metadata
https://github.com/neonlabsorg/solana-program-library/tree/evm_integration/metamask-wrapper/program/src
Is there a way to learn epoch info at a specific slot?
Where can I start ??
<@!489206164270350337> one thing you may consider as a bug: I am able to calculate the first slot of the current epoch with --> `absolute slot - slot index ` from this ep https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getepochinfo.

But i figured out some blocks are skipped so getEpochInfo may cause a problem if returned data is considered true. i just wanted to inform you. you can check the latest epoch, it has the same issue
Hello, need to build a bridge from solana to kusama-dot . Is there developments going on for this ??
Could anyone point me to any resources (or any advice) on creating a smart contract that can reward interest to NFT holders?
Forgive me for asking, but can someone help me find the tools to basically just track transactions between 2 wallet addresses I have the public keys?
Hi <@!489206164270350337>, thanks for your reply, if the only way to change that transfer behavior is to create a wrapper program for my token, how can I restrict transfer behavior to only come from that wrapper program?

Also, could I implement its code as a smart contract to be put on chain?
Check metaplex for candy machine support https://discord.gg/metaplex
Thank you, not sure this is what it was, but I think this will help
got timed out it seems
Here's the web3 typedocs https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html
can someone help me please? got an urgent topic üò¶ created 300 nfts and uploaded them to mainnet-beta, after 199 metaplex stopped and now I only got the authority but not the candymachineaddress... is there a way I can retrive it or is my money gone for uploading?
can anyone help me find a list of the JavaScript Solana methods? I swear I had one up yesterday but I lost the tab and can not find it.
Here is an example of invoking the spl transfer from within another program: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token-swap/program/src/processor.rs#L138
spl token program is different than erc20. What you would probably need to do is create a wrapper program for your token, and change your functionality in the wrapper program. You would then invoke internal to your program the `transfer` function.
Yeah 1 million lasts a few minutes anyway üëç
Ha yeah I saw that. The solana docs say no limit, but I assume the cli is more accurate
`--limit-ledger-size <SHRED_COUNT>            Keep this amount of shreds in root slots. [default: 10000]`
my help stated the default was 10000
Weird though, the default is no limit, so I would think I don't need it
You are a star
Hi <@!489206164270350337> , what exactly do you mean by "create a different program and create new tokens off of that"? What is the program you're referring to?

I want to make sure I understand what you're saying exactly‚Äì‚Äìare you saying that there's no way to modify the transaction logic for a specific SPL token as there is for a token that is ERC20 compliant?

Thanks again for your help
Looks like you can increase the test validator ledger size with `--limit-ledger-size`
A day or a few hours is fine for my purposes. Will need to figure out how to extend it locally, maybe there's a setting
Transfer is already defined here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L203
You could create a different program and create new tokens off of that, but I don't know what kind of support you'd get.
Hi <@!489206164270350337>, thanks for your reply, maybe I'm getting lost in the terminology but I'm not sure I understand your response. How would I actually go about implementing my own token standard? What does a token standard entail? If I implement this standard, is it possible to introduce custom transact code for this token?
I think on the local test validator there's a specific amount kept in memory. Some RPCs don't have all historical information either
I'm not exactly sure. Looks like there are some checks made during the associated token account creation to prevent that kind of attack https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/886e7e654036577b1d284884a08bd007dfda3361/associated-token-account/program/src/processor.rs#L40
However, if there is a program that changes authority of your token account, that is a possibility. But that's a separate discussion
Thanks a lot!
Does getSignaturesForAddress have a slot history limit or something? Locally if I use it after a transation I'll get one result, but if I wait a few minutes the results are empty. There are config options but I would expect the defaults to be ok?
But if they are not reserved I could do an "attack" by creating an account which is someone else's associated token account for let's say USDC, and then when that user tries to receive USDC first time he won't be able to because wallets won't be able to create his token account since address is taken?
<@456226577798135808> 
```rust
#[derive(BorshDeserialize)]
struct Foo {
  // fields
}

let result = Foo::try_from_vec(data).unwrap(); // Where data is a &[u8]
```
Most have just moved to using WSL
Is there possible solution while staying on windows?
Metaplex has some js packages. You could check if they already deserialize your specific data buffer here https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/js
That's data from candy machine so I do know. How would I deserialize it then?
Windows support is shakey at best. General recommendation is to use WSL
You can implement your own token standard, or separate program that uses changes in token accounts to do another action. The token program vs erc20 are two different things. For example, you do not have to deploy another contract to get a token, you create accounts and use `mint` from the token program instead
If you know the structure of the data as it was serialized inside the program itself, you could deserialize it in Rust (also knowing if they used borsh or serde)
How to resolve this issue on windows? error: failed to run custom build command for `ring v0.16.20`
I don't think it is done the way you think it is. Check out how chainlink is storing and retrieving data https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-solana-demo
They're not necessarily reserved, but all derived from a common pattern. Check out this code for implementation https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/cd63580b796319056edbbcca8690deb54c56581d/token/js/client/token.js#L2277
I am not sure what is the procedure for this
Hi everyone,

Can someone please help me review a quick PR? https://github.com/solana-labs/ecosystem/pull/761
They're two different standards, derived different ways. You can find how Solana keypairs are generated here https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/blob/master/nacl.js#L1097
<:pepemoneymaker:902223325344960512>
Nice - it's interesting that the seed phrase doesn't work though, I suspect phantom uses a slightly different scheme. Keep those keypair files safe! Also I'd try recovering into phantom from the seed phrase, so you know if that actually works or not - othereise you migth think you have a paper backup, but it doesn't work.
That's what I'm trying to do lol
does anyone know how to monitor the blockchain for candy machines?
How can I turn account data into usable data with the Rust APIs?
This is what it currently looks like:
```
data: 9b0caae01efacc82f135d30b4003666c03121483b01c86198bbeb76ffa2e7c5775b2830b8ee1e843060000004450346470480a00000046414c00000000000000
```
Sick yea got the correct public key in the CLI
Quick question, there is a maximum amount of lamports for a transfer?
lets see what happens
Just got the python script to work
YEah that looks like it says exactly what I said above - didn't you say that didn't work though?
Here's sending a custom spl token instead https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token-swap/program/src/processor.rs#L138
i know, im asking why generating Ethereum PK is way faster than generating Solana PK
I should probably experiment/learn a bit with phantom, as all my real keys are airgapped so it doesn't matter that I don't trust it üòÑ
Ethereum public key =/= Solana public key
found this
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69245982/import-phantom-wallet-private-key-into-solana-cli
Anyhow - that might not even be right, I could be remembering it wrong.
I think `prompt://?key=0/0` should give you the main phantom address, but there was someone before who had the issue as well and I think it turned out phantom used un-hardened paths whereas the CLI converts those `0/0` into hardened values `0'/0'` - I don't really know why, or what that means, just that it produces different addresses.
Under settings theres a option to export a private key for a wallet
Yea it didnt give me the correct pubkey key
You could write some code to import the base58 private key (where do you even get this from in phantom - do you have to go digging or does it provide it? I've never used phantom) and then export to the json format, which I think is just a byte array (again, not actually looked under the hood on this one). If not you can probably easily found out the format üôÇ
Hrm- try typing it in again, carefully. That message means it's not a valid BIP44 seed phrase - I thought phantom uses those though. You can try with `--skip-seed-phrase-validation` but I suspect you'll get the wrong/new addresses if the seed phrase isn't valid.
Hi Solana team, I'm trying to set up a new fungible token and I'm wondering how to go about **changing the logic of the transfer method** for that token.

For context, I'm trying to recreate on Solana what I've created on Ethereum using Solidity. Using Solidity, I've created a standard contract that implements methods like transfer, approve, etc. to conform to ERC20 standards. Can I change the logic of these methods when working off of Solana? If so, are there standards I should conform to? 

Finally, when building/testing those contracts on Ethereum, I've found Remix IDE tremendously helpful. What is the recommended dev testing workflow for Solana?

Thanks so much in advance for your help!
Getting this error as well when trying to import the seed phrase : Can't get mnemonic from seed phrases
how do i make it the correct format
So the private key in phantom is in base58 and the id.json is different
Oh - you'll probably want to put each key into a separate file so your CLI will look something like this:
```solana-keygen recover prompt://?key=0/0 -o mainaddress.json
solana-keygen recover prompt://?key=1/0 -o derived1.json
...etc.
```
1. Post any screenshots of the scammers trying to "help" you into the <#812122623654887444> channel
2. Use your seed phrase on the CLI - do `solana-keygen recover --help` to see how. It will prompt you. You will need to use `prompt://?key=0/0` and repeat with `1/0` `2/0` etc for each derived address.
Any suggestions to help ?
Question trying to import a wallet from Phantom to the Solana CLI but having issues with formating
Sorry for the late reply! I meant things like number of followers a Twitter account has, polling numbers for a politician, etc... just metrics that aren't tied to traded assets
anyone know the best way to get around this error? ` error: FetchError: request to https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/ failed, reason: read ECONNRESET` is the solution basically to use a paid RPC provider?

the execute of thos txIns is a tx for it self?

hey guys, i am trying to create a stake account and delegate it to my node with web3 API
there are a few things i don't understand.
1. if you look at the attached image you can see 3 tx (instead of 2(one for new stake account and 1 for delegate to node))
2. some of the tx have "unknown" titles - which does not look so good - how can i change it to "delegate" or something more "friendly" ?

yea useMemo is used for caching and update in React.  anything with 'use' in front is likely related to React and a quick google will help update you on usage.
Thanks, it seems clearer now. I'm not very good at React, thought the useMemo hook was something Solana-related. üòÖ  Much appreciated!
you can use this : to set up your custom RPC endpoint.  just use your localhost address instead. the default adapter network is shipped with the 3 public rpc end points for demoing usage. you can create or extend your enum or list of adapters as needed. remember this sets the network for the connection provider.  wallets network are set independently and are generally switched inside the wallet plugin itself. so the wallet network would be set manually in the browser/plugin, and your app maintains the connection provider ('network') your connecting to.
if needed you can just set it directly const endpoint = "<your local host addr>"  
`// You can also provide a custom RPC endpoint
    const endpoint = useMemo(() => clusterApiUrl(network), [network]);`
Thank Uhhh üôÇ
I built the image in `ci/docker-rust/Dockerfile` but it doesn't have `npm` for building the docs. I'll just create a custom Dockerfile I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
okay, thanks
Oh - thanks - seems odd to not have a shared/common build environment though.
should be the same with `wss` instead of https
many have been floating around, im not sure with all the changes if anything more official is in use atm. someone else may have more insight. the images ive seen have been created for various purposes, like this 1 geared at mac m1s a short while back.
https://github.com/metaspan/solana-docker-mac-m1
I have not used any of them.
createProgramAddress, may be geared more towards Program account use, and PDAs (off curve), so the program can also sign. 
createWithSeed similar but different, offers a derivation path with some built in help and param options like baseKey, which could be anything, but is common to be some wallet key or other 'base' address you want to use as a primary key reference. stake-pool may use something like this. it allows the program to own/write data to the account. this also makes looking up an account easier as long as you have the keys/seeds used and could be used to create an account for a user and store data in a program, for example, and having the keys to lookup you can easily reference the account in the future. a non pda account can also store more data, at present.
https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints 
what is the link for `RPC PubSub WebSocket Endpoint`?
But setting up the wallet requires me to pass a `WalletAdapterNetwork` Or am I missing something here?
Is there a docker image for the solana build environment?
yes you can just add in your localhost path or use it instead when setting up the wallet, pointing to the same path your local validator may be running on.
What is the difference between PublicKey.createWithSeed and PublicKey.createProgramAddress, isn't both returns the deterministic public key? 

I want to create deterministic account in which my program can store data, I'm going to use SystemProgram.createAccountWithSeed for creating deterministic account, so what is going to be my basePubkey? and what method should I use to find newAccountPubkey

Any help would be appreciatedüôÇ

Thank You!
Hi all, apologies if this has been asked before, but is there a way to use wallet adapters with `localhost`? It's not entirely obvious from the doc how to do that https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter#readme . The `WalletAdapterNetwork` enum only supports mainnet, devnet and testnet as far as I can tell.
when you run the install, at the end it may print the instructions about your path.  you would need to add the path to a profile  like zsh or bash or another profile that gets loaded when terminal starts. the docs will not tell you the exact path, because it can be unique to your setup. 
the docs mentions several lines down about `PATH` from the link sent. 
if your not as familiar with linux/mac, try running the install again and look for the path. you will need to add this to your terminal profile that gets loaded. to persist over more than the current terminal session.
i cant find it in the docs
Is there anything like EVM's `delegatecall` on Solana?
Where can I get paid to learn how to build on solana?

there are usually instructions after the install to make sure the necessary info is in the path obj for your environment variables. 
it may depend on how you installed and your path setup, os, etc, but if you follow the docs, and or instructions about the path variable before you close terminal, to put it in your path permanently and not only the existing sessions, it should work as expected.

where do ya'll stake your sol?
did you try the serum / wallet discord channels, they own the sollet domain. 
https://discord.gg/x7ZV8Gah
any idea how to solve this
i isntalled the solana tool suite but when i close terminal and reopen it, i cant use the solana command and dont have my wallet
and then you get a wallet object that has wallet.publicKey, wallet.signTransaction, etc on it
would go something like `const wallet = new Wallet(publicKey)`
does anyone know the js function to create a new wallet object from just the public address.. i think its in @projet-serum/anchor or maybe its in one of the @solana packages, but don't recall
(Lets try this again:)

I got a TX caught in the sollet solana<>ethereum bridge because my ledger acted up (sigh...).
Anyone know how I can generate this type of TX again, manually?
The first part of the TX is done in sollet/solana which is fine. But the remaining ETH TX is missing.

ie generate this: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb4768e005705f692527ca45bd94f3e44f9032c0fddd486b747d8e25ca5d17acb 
(this is only an example TX, not mine)

Any sollet devs in here? I sent sollet emails, but they all bounced back.
Yea that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do, thank you
Thanks  for ur advice,  do u have any idea where I can mesg them
Its supposedly open source, but IDK where repos are at. Maybe you can build a custom front end?

Is there a way to use wormhole to power my own custom bridge ?
I believe that's the cost of Arweave IPFS. Go ask in Metaplex.
you do
yes
Thanks, so no way of going round that? I HAVE TO pay?
but yes, sounds about right. 10k runs about 20SOL from what I've heard
Hahah might as well

Hey guys quick help, I am creating an NFT collection of 18k unique pieces, is it possible that it is asking me 30+ SOL to host the items on an ipfs server?
<@!445425471027544095> I want to make an update to the spl-token JS. Readme says to contact you about npm publish rights?
I'm not even sure if a mint owner can transfer SOL out of the account, I'm not sure spl-token is built for that.
Probably not the right place to ask this, but answer is probably no. You'd need to ask the oxs devs to see exactly what you sent it to. If it's a token mint address then the answer is likely no, but maybe you sent it to a program that they can upgrade.
Oxs is sol project
Hey , i was transferring 0.4 sol in phantom wallet to buy oxs and while doing so , By mistakenly transferred the sol to oxs coins address mentioned on the coinmatketcap.
just wanted to know now if there is any way out to recover lost cryptocoin.it will be great favour if any of u know anything abt this u and can help.

Regards
Anand
Hi
really saved my bacon
thank you guys
0x24
I think the x25 is hex so 37 if looking at source
If you are not running locally (i.e. `solana-test-validator`) then, yes... everbodies logs
You can subscribe to log messages with filters (see the RPC/Web3 apis)
otherwise you have to dig into the source for the program tx and figure out which error is the 25th in the array
is there a way to filter?
is this everybodies logs?
For the most straightforward answer you can start the log monitor in a terminal: `solana logs`
`    RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x24 [5 log messages]`
where can I see the log messages?
this probably been asked million times but can't see an answer on search

hey
It looks like I can add a parameter to the function signature without breaking anything, would I need to write a unit test first?
Hey I have a question for core devs: 

Would it be acceptable for me to submit a PR to change the spl-token createMint function which adds a mintAccountPubkey parameter? This will allow one to create mints in JS tests with static addresses and will assist with front end development that requires the mints to be explicitly defined (serum-ts, swap markets, &c..)
thank u so much! it works
solved. ty
wow, if this works, u are my savior
yes.
system program being 111111111... ?
in you client, you need to pack system program into account meta.
then on chain you get it and pass it into the array which used by invoke
system_program.clone() ?
been stuck on this all day
how sir.
you should pass system program in the invoke
i need to do it in the program
this is failing too, it say i need to pass in the accounts even though i already did
`let pay_lender_ix = solana_program::system_instruction::transfer (
            borrower.key,
            lender_account.key,
            5,  
        );

        msg!("Paying lender interest");
        invoke(
            &pay_lender_ix,
            &[
                borrower.clone(),
                lender_account.clone(),
            ],

        )?;`
or you can try something like quickNode or rpcPool. there are some rpc endpoint solutions.
if not, how do i do invoke system_instruction::transfer from me to another account
how to transfer ownership to program?
there are some account's don't belong to the current program.
program can only modify account which it owned
FYI findProgramAddress will use sha256(seed + program_id + a bump seed) then check it is on curve
so your all questions can replace to is it possible to generate two same hash if I give different seeds.
and AFAIK it is very very very hard.
i am signer of borrower, both accounts are writable
Error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: instruction spent from the balance of an account it does not own

        **lender_account.lamports.borrow_mut() = lender_account.lamports()
        .checked_add(escrow_info.expected_amount)
        .ok_or(EscrowError::InvalidInstruction)?;`
nft is just a mint, just use `spl-token trasnfer --help`
token supply is stored in u64. in the other words
your total supply should less or equals then u64 max or you got overflow error
`supply * 10^decimal <= u64's max (approx, 1.84e19)`
for now. if you want to emit event, you can use `msg!` to print log and use getTransaction to retrieve it back.
anyone?
trying to see some examples of what it would look like

Hello, I‚Äôm looking to hire a dev for my NFT project. Which channel here is the right one to post in?
Could you tell if staking affects the validation process? Do all the nodes still participate in consensus if some nodes don't have any stake? Because running a multinode setup with scripts from `multinode-demo` will result in validators having 0 stake, and bootstrap having 100%, and running `net` example will distribute stake differently. Thank you!
can someone point me to a doc or example of a solana program emitting an event that can be picked up by an external client? Please.
if i vanity my own mint keypair, do i need to keep mint secret securely (or throw away) after minted?
no. accounts are a list you passed which needed in this instruciton.
Try looking through this: https://spl.solana.com/

is solana working on polkadot ?
Is there a generic word for the "small" integer variant of a coin, like "lamports" or "satoshis"?
how are we meant to replace the deprecated `setSigners` method? I have this: 
```transaction.setSigners(

      ...signers.map((s) => s.publicKey)
    )```
I'm not sure what it should look like without `setSigners`
https://tenor.com/view/meryl-streep-yes-yeah-cheer-cheering-gif-5163144
you have to save the seed phrase somewhere otherwise its lost forever, I use these:
```
    const seeds = {
        'testA': [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], // random numbers that you have to remember to access, you can generate these using whatever.
    };

    // Generate or load wallet using seed
    async function generateWalletUsingSeed(seedString) {
        let seed = Uint8Array.from(seeds[seedString]);
        let wallet = web3.Keypair.fromSeed(seed);

        return wallet;
    }

    (async () => {
        var walletA = await generateWalletUsingSeed('testA');

        console.log({
            pubKey: walletA.publicKey.toBase58(),
            secret: walletA.secretKey,
        });
    });

```
Hello everyone, I am trying to port one of my Solidity Smart Contract To Solana. When i run a local test validators, it runs, but i am unable to deploy my smart contract to it. It gets stuck at finalizing transaction (I have an M1 Machine btw) . Any solutions for that?
hey, does anyone know how to transfer nft via command line to another wallet address ?
I have some question about PDAs (maybe some don't make sense, please clarify me). 
1) Given two different programs, it is possible that `findProgramAddress` generates two equal PDA for the two (each could use any seed)? 
2) Assuming that `findProgramAddress` does not probe the blockchain when generating the address (it just verifies whether is it on the curve), how reliable is that the address it generates is not already in use by other program? (This question only makes sense if the answer to the first is true) 
3) If it is not possible that the PDA of two different programs collide, how many unique PDA each program has available?
4) For one program, is it possible that `findProgramAddress` generates two equal PDA for different seeds?
Ok, I think I'm a bit confused. Can you clarify a few things for me?

```javascript
const bip39 = require("bip39");
const crypto = require("crypto");
const sol = require("@solana/web3.js");

// Random seed
let seed = crypto.randomBytes(32);

// Seed phrase
let seedPhrase = bip39.entropyToMnemonic(seed.toString("hex"));

// Generate keypair
sol.Keypair.fromSeed(Uint8Array.from(seed));

// 1) How to get the wallet address in string format, the same way as solana CLI tool: solana-keygen new ?
// 2) If seeds are one-way, how is the seed phrase then validated?

bip39.mnemonicToSeed(seedPhrase).then((seed) => {
  // seed is different than the result of "sol.Keypair.fromSeed(Uint8Array.from(seed))" from the above
});
```
how i can disable transfer feature for fixed interval after minting?
<@!330774061787381762> did you figure it out?
Hey

I'm trying to subscribe to a wallet using `accountSubscribe` to get  info about incoming transactions. But I got empty data. Like 

```{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"accountNotification","params":{"result":{"context":{"slot":106642888},"value":{"lamports":11280819249,"data":["","base64"],"owner":"11111111111111111111111111111111","executable":false,"rentEpoch":246}},"subscription":24403}}```

What I would like to see is a transaction, like
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/5Tduh5iMTQgo2hfMhrrQdKAHx1qR1vtk1dwkbBQSqfZSgwkhJd5aoBfmaV1W4RNirtpj1Ny6LVZ3FPRwVuzi6HX6

from transactions list
https://explorer.solana.com/address/HyfWtQjKwoP9wRxFfceVq1ptqpJHCrM9qWXS5ieFgh9t
hi every one 
is any any way ro getblock information without running validator?

https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com have a rat limit and can't use it
ty üôÇ I got it.
its one way, you can use random numbers to generate a seed
Hi all!! I am very new to Solana
In the following program:
```rust
entrypoint!(process_instruction);

pub fn process_instruction(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    _instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
    msg!("Hello World Rust program entrypoint");
    let accounts_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let account = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;
```

Is **accounts** similar to that of **msg.sender** in solidity ??
Aw fk, I was trying to convert 64 bits and not 32 bits ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Also, all authentications requires Uint8Arrays as parameter, so I think it has to be possible to convert them back-n-forth? I may miss something, tho
Hmm, so how can I generate seed phrase if I'm using JS lib? Generated key pairs are Uint8Arrays
added funds to wallet still cannot see account info ü§î
I think that's impossible, seeds are seed for a reason
`bip39.entropyToMnemonic(Buffer.from(Uint8Array).toString('hex'))` throws `Invalid entropy` error
I'm using `@solana/web3.js` and I was wondering how to convert `Uint8Array` to seed phrase, and vice versa?
yes to your last 2 questions. mint stores info about the token type and supply. token account store user balance for the related mint, among other info.
After minting token, Do the token account get minted token?
Can only the mint account mint the token?
Can anybody explain the concept of mint account?
Is there a particular way I could access the wallet and find out if the particular NFT is from our minted collection or not?
i see. so it's not so dangerous after all üôÇ
for token account, you can use close account to retrieve it back
https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/advanced/token/close-account.html
actually #1 is kind of dangerous, so if you accidentally transfer native SOL to a Token Account, how do you transfer it out ?
chido is super helpful ! i learnt alot
How you can know tons of information. I envy you üôÇ
Ty chido!
1. although all accounts can receive, it don't represent that all account can transfer it out.
2. WSOL is a token account so it can only use token program's trasnfer not system program's trasnfer
3. use WSOL can unify your interface. like if you want to do a swap program. you can use token transfer to handle it. you don't need to write a special function for native SOL because native SOL need system program's transfer. just limit user to send WSOL.
thanks chido!
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts#rent
https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/rent
I think the main idea is when a program can only modify account's data which the account owned by it. so if your account is WSOL, you can't use system transfer anymore because this account belongs to token program
Is there a better channel to ask this question?
If all accounts (include data or token accounts) can receive sol, it is not clear why WSOL exists.
Hi trying to understand how to calculate rent costs, 
The documentation says `rent is deducted at a rate specified in genesis, in lamports per kilobyte-year`.
What is the lamports per kilobyte-year rate?
to re-iterate -  any accounts can hold SOL. Now if the account happens to be a token account (or ata), it can hold both SOL and whatever the mint related (which can be WSOL). WSOL is just a convenient way so that program can deal with token transfer in a unified way without having to switch between SystemProgram.transfer vs SPL-Token.transfer.  Is this fair <@!788215642070581289>  ?
ty chido üòä
Oh I got it. WSOL only can be transfer to WSOL's token account
you can transfer your SOL to any accounts you want.
you can only transfer your WSOL to a token account which is WSOL's token account.
anyway, the main idea is that just remember to
1) pass system program into your tx
2) also pass it into your invoke
its in a separate invoke that works
oh. so why you pass TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID? I think you use in the other place because you also pass something like takerYTokenAccountPubkey
but i want to transfer lamports not token though, why do i need my TOKEN_PROGRAM for SOL transfer
use the same way you pass TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
all account you need you have to pack into your tx. in your program you want to do SOL trasnfer.
so you will need `from`, `to`, `system program`
then in you `invoke` you have to clone these three account and pass
I don't know if I understood correctly.

Is it possible that both SOL and WSOL can be transfer to ATA?
which program? How do we pass in program
because in the invoke, you need to pass program into it.
`const exchangeInstruction = new TransactionInstruction({
        programId,
        data: Buffer.from(Uint8Array.of(1, ...new BN(1).toArray("le", 8))),
        keys: [
            { pubkey: takerAccount.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true },
            { pubkey: takerYTokenAccountPubkey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true },
            { pubkey: escrowState.XTokenTempAccountPubkey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true},
            { pubkey: escrowAccountPubkey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true },
            { pubkey: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, isSigner: false, isWritable: false},
            { pubkey: PDA[0], isSigner: false, isWritable: true}
        ] 
    })    `
its the same, my bad my To account was not writable. But im getting this new error: "Error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: An account required by the instruction is missing" when i change PDA to writable
i see. a little less confusing now. thanks <@!788215642070581289>
yes. it print token balance for you.
~~FYI wrap sol will tell you SOL balance~~
never mind. this is a bad example. don't read. just assume token account print token balance
and when you look at it in explorer, you only see the balance for the token mint, not the SOL balance: https://explorer.solana.com/address/6ZkU1BohdsAei8dXbXuPttLA9Rf4BzzWjoD1qTQSXyKs?cluster=devnet
yes.
your &pda and escrow_account is the same accounts?
and I also want to check you client code. for transfer, your `from` is a signer and writable, your `to` is writable.
I see. so the token account in this example holds both SOL and whatever the token specified by the mint ?
you qn mix many concepts. I give you some points.
1. you can transfer your SOL to any accounts. transfer SOL to a token account tx (https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4uqZKKh1jKVaHZmXxmynNnmzVHtTvhuJEMerNCnvTE3iJdj341XSRyspeHW2G2mgfkNodryLcVkmPxJrPABR2Yx9?cluster=devnet)
2. only SOL in WSOL account can transfer to other (via token transfer), after you transfer, there is a sync instruction you have to do.
`let deposit_collateral_ix = transfer (
            borrower.key,
            &pda,
            escrow_info.expected_amount, 

        );

        msg!("Depositing collateral to lock in borrower");
        invoke(
            &deposit_collateral_ix,
            &[
                borrower.clone(),
                escrow_account.clone(),
            ],
        )?;`
im trying to transfer lamports to a PDA, getting this error despite my account(BORROWER) being writable  "Cross-program invocation with unauthorized signer or writable account"
ie. how does an SPL-Token account recieve native SOL ?
for token account. you can retrieve all sol back including rent and amount you transfer into it.
depends on program's implementation.
for token account, you can use closeAccount to retrieve.
not all accounts can be retrieved/closed (like mint account)
no. wrap SOL is a token, only wrap SOL's ATA can receive.
but sol is native token, all token account (actually all accounts) can receive.
FYI https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4uqZKKh1jKVaHZmXxmynNnmzVHtTvhuJEMerNCnvTE3iJdj341XSRyspeHW2G2mgfkNodryLcVkmPxJrPABR2Yx9?cluster=devnet
this is a tx to transfer native SOL to a token account.
and you can try to send a wrap SOL to this account (with creating another token account). it should be failed.
Only question what I have from this comment, Then can I also retrieve SOL for paying rent fee from associated token account.
ty! new information to me
If sol needs to be retrieved, is it also a way to transfer it directly to the main wallet?
you need to wrap SOL before sending to an associated token account
depends on program's implementation.
for token account, you can use `closeAccount` to retrieve.
not all accounts can be retrieved/closed (like mint account)
how would you retrieve the sol again?
yes. you can. FYI all accounts can receive SOL.
Hello, guys.

I have a question.
Can I also transfer my SOL to associated token account?
your not even getting a response on ping? so something else is wrong
has anything ever worked for you in the cli ? and what version are u on
what comes back in your?  `solana address` `solana balance`

it depends, but from cli you can generally do `solana cluster-version` and `solana -V` to check some version info for the cluster and the CLI version your running.  in the case of `airdrop`, if your doing that to devnet, unless it happen to hit one of the nodes that was catching up or the call was temporarily unreachable it shouldnt do that. Its possible the call failed to get routed appropriately through load balancing in the instance that was called.  
other things: 
what is your url for dev your using?     it should be `https://api.devnet.solana.com` .  there may be an older version floating around still.  
I assume the airdrop for you has worked before? or has it never worked? and do other cli calls work?
Got it. Thank You So Much for this great explanationüòÉ
The offline signing documentation talks about it a bit... but basically if you signed a transaction that said pay 1 SOL to Joe, what's to stop Joe from submitting that (signed by you) transaction 100 times to get 100 SOL instead? This is called a "replay attack", but if the signed transaction contains a number that can only be used once, when the transaction is processed it will only work the first time. The nonce account simply provides a way to get such a number (n-once value) so that you can include it in a transaction (this happens automatically for online-signed transactions)
Thanks!! Could you please give me an example to understand where or in what cases a nonce account can be useful?
Thanks - how can I change the rpc endpoint or check the version? 
I check using solana config get and everything seems to be fine/pointing to devnet
It's a way to get a unique value that can only be used once - in order to prevent replay attacks on valid signed transactions.
What is a nonce account?
I see, the problem is that I have to preset the update authority. I was hoping to just set it to the program id itself. I'm struggling to put together how I would create the PDA inside the program and preset it as the update authority.
A dapp on the Luna chain might only accept UST so the Solana smart contract would need to send that some how
Is it possible for a Solana smart contract to send UST ?
how are you calling, and what is the error?  details are helpful.
you can either support the migration through the bridge process or support the bridged SPL-Tokens. You can find out more through the worm hole channels and github:
https://discord.gg/wormholecrypto
use a PDA (program derived address) to sign on behalf of a program from within the program itself. the program itself does not sign.
method not found can mean the  call your trying to make is out of sync, differs in version, or not found on the network your calling. you may have to check the version your using against the network your using, and or try a different RPC end point that has the supported call.

hi I am having some issue with minting nft using candy-machine-mint should I ask here or maybe a different discord?
either way it's good to know what does what, i thought they did the same thing, i discovered `solana deploy` by accident lol
No plan to deprecate it at this point, the old loader is still viable.  When ABIv2 comes in and bakes we will probably deprecate the existing loaders and push folks to that.
`solana deploy` is now secret, but perhaps we'll deprecate it in an upcoming release.  <@!453347985628200960> probably has a better idea of the future on these
haha frank. how humble. you rock.
I don't see the old one listed on the docs https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program. However, it may be good to retire the old one in support of the new.  <@!539801435571748868> Any reason why we still support `solana deploy` instead of just requiring `--final` on `solana program deploy` to use the old loader?
maybe the team should put a warning about this in the CLI
I only knew about ComputeBudget because we extended it for a bunch of syscalls we wanted added in a PR... alas... I
we're smart in different areas
Frank, you have often answered the Rust question I don't know yet(still learning)
I stand on the shoulders of these giants!
And another smart person!
probably subjective but Pyth has been in Solana longer and used by more.
I'll have a look in their discord.  Thanks!
Thanks for the heads up - and yeah - I do wonder if figment is limiting that.
don't mean to spam this channel but since there're so many smart people here, allow me to fire another question 
I am looking to incorporate price oracle to my smart contract, which one is most reliable - CHAINLINK or PYTH ?
generally after some time it will be ok again.
free or pay systems tend to be limited by some tier.  it may not be for abuse, but rate limits help with that. if you use a different RPC or a pay RPC you may have more flexibility.
Didn't even realize this was here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/036d7fcc819dbab8f54a8cbf3fd5c446ec83ecc1/sdk/src/compute_budget.rs#L103
See, he's smarter üôÇ
<@!814228493302497301> is smart !
At the ComputeBudget
I looked in the repo source üôÇ
didn't think I was abusing the system
boo
looks like its a rate limit, not a funds issue.
That was with figment
I tried using devnet and using figment's RPC and got ```scromie@vultr:~/projects/scromietoken$ solana airdrop 1
Requesting airdrop of 1 SOL
Error: airdrop request failed. This can happen when the rate limit is reached.```
nope  what issue are you facing?
Also, <@!814228493302497301>, saw you knew exactly how much computation units msg took. Do you know how to calculate this?
Folks - did the airdrop faucet run out of funds for devnet?
`solana deploy` is the older form of deployment, and programs deployed with it are forever immutable
`solana program deploy` uses the upgradeable BFP loader, allowing it to be upgraded if the upgrade authority is set. You can also make them immutable with `--final`
If that is the case, there must be a way to change ownership but not sure how PDA's would be handled
I think the `solana deploy` pushes immutable whereas `solana program deploy` makes it upgradeable. Maybe on of the smarter folks can confirm, like <@!489206164270350337> , <@!788215642070581289> , etc.
which is opposite to the blockchain mantra - program should be immutable üò¶
does this also mean most program will stay mutable/upgradable for a long time ?
Don't know personally
do you think this how the current protocols like Raydium or Orca does migrationg ?
Cool, let us know what you end up with and how it works out. Really should be in the `best practices` to have a version scheme for instances like this.
yes, definitely do this as a safety. the decorate as you mentioned would help to skip some processing.
But you need the check in the unpack anyway eh?
If thats what you need, so be it
Problem is most program has regular processing, ie. regular liquidation check, ... which would break the moment the new program version deploy - hence, can't always wait for the users to actually get in - which needs eager migration.
Aye
I see. Eager migration vs Lazy migration
Not my approach by choice, I would:
1. Deploy the new code that has the checks for old version in the `unpack` processing and `decorate` as needed, especially if you serialized a `struct` and your new deployment has new struct
2. On the pack, I'd put the new version in (that way if you hit step 1 again, you don't go through the decoration routine) with the new data structure of information
3. I'd wait until the account to migrate was accessed during normal processing
4. If you absolutely need to do all accounts ASAP after deployment then your approach works
I see. That sounds like a reasonable approach. How would you go about touching all the accounts ? Let's say you have 1000 accounts that need to be migrated to the new format. I am thinking steps below. I

#1 In the new program version, create a new entry call - migrate(accountId) that does the account version check and perform migration.

#2 Write a node client that scan all the existing program accounts and execute migrate(accountId) one at a time.

Is this how you would approach ? wonder if there is an in-depth discussion somewhere that I can drill in more on this topic.
In wherever the message was I suggested that you include a 'version' indicator in the account data. I would take the approach that my new program will check to see if the data needs to be restructured on the `unpack` call, reformat it and then serialize the new structure on `pack`. The 'version'/write on access was a throwback to old OO days but it still has value here
Frank The Man ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è very helpful thanks
<@!814228493302497301> I am thinking of 2 approaches : #1 deploy a new program and ask the user to switch manually #2 run some sort of migration job to update all program accounts to the new format. which one is advisable ?
Depends on if you are staying within bounds of the original allocation. I wrote a BOE summary approach back there in the chat somewhere
<@!903369685570035822>  The calls to `msg!` is 100 execution units however; if you do formatting that will cost you more cycles so be real prudent üôÇ
But accounts have fixed size set at creation? So. You'd need to create extra accounts for a user if they store too much...
<@!785084693023424542> any pointers ?
anyway it's a nitpick. anchor provides pure program logging into a file but it seems the base solana cli does not. either way i can get what i need if i really want
yeah this is not so good because it has tons of other stuff besides program logs
Good day! Is it possible to lock an `spl-account` from receiving any tokens? It is just that my program has an internal state related to an amount of tokens it owns, and when someone transfers tokens directly to an account the state might become incoherent and lead to lots of possible vulnerabilities and errors
how would one goes about changing the account data structure  (ie. adding a new field) after the program went live and already had users ? I am looking for best practices in program upgrade path that doesn't mess up existing account data
I can see them in my anchor folders, so I would expect so
üëå thanks
oh ok.. this will have the user-defined program logs as well?
not that im aware of, but im sure there is a limit. msg! takes compute, and you can run out of units so use it sparingly.
They usually start with validator-<time>.log
yes. in addition you can stream the logs in another terminal and can access them with `solana logs`
i looked around in there but didnt see what i was looking for.. i may just be blind lol im tired rn. thanks
I believe you can find your test validator logs under the directory you started it in `/test-ledger`
one other question... what is the limit for how large a `msg!()` program log can be? is this defined somewhere? or is it just dependent on hardware constraints
Hey, does anyone know when soemone will accept the token-list pull request auto merge ?
this does not help me. anchor is just an example. i simply want to see all program logs after the test validator has been shut down
type in `anchor log` into the search in anchor discord for anchor logs.  aside from what you should already see in the console from anchor when running anchor test.
ik  you can stream them in real time with `solana logs -u localhost` but for something like Anchor testing which spins the validator up and down it's not usable
if not by default is there a way to make the local validator automatically write the program logs into a file?
is there a way to access the program logs (like the msg() type messages and compute unites and such) of a solana-test-validator, after the validator has been stopped?

<@!489206164270350337> 
I am sending transaction to my anchor program with rpc. But I got custom program errors.
I hope to know what the custom errors mean and how I can fix it.
I believe it is 0.00203928 SOL, which is the minimum balance for a token account to be rent exempt
Probably multiple accounts, as you may run out of memory to store information in one account as the marketplace grows. If multiple, you could just go based on offers and store separately
How much is the average cost of funding a recipient when sending spl tokens?
Something like `sysvar::rent::Rent::get()
        .unwrap()
        .minimum_balance(data_size)`
Looks like you can use `minimum_balance` from the sdk https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/1.8.3/solana_sdk/rent/struct.Rent.html#method.minimum_balance
<@!489206164270350337> .
I will write code here.
Please help me.
What exactly are you doing? If it is a custom program, it may be coming from what you wrote
Who is in charge of the token-list repository? how can I contact?
Hello.
`Transaction simulation failed: Error processingInstruction 4: custom program error: 0x12e`
`Program 11111111111111111111111111111111 invoke [1]`
Who know what does the 0x12e Transcation error mean? please help me
How can i get the `getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption` on rust api to create an account ? i can't find it
I'm doing everything via the JSON RPC, so probably not comparable.
Ahh makes sense - I was doing this on the CLI: `solana block $(solana slot) | grep Recent | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $3}'` which I think is kinda dumb, so if you know a better way LMK üòÑ
I think I solved it. I had to pass 'finalized' to getRecentBlockhash().
thanks!
So if I build say a marketplace, would I be storing all data in one account, or each user's market placements go in their own account?

And in either case, how can I know beforehand the size the accounts will need to be, since as I understand, allocated account size can't be increased after creation??
Hello! I emailed security@solana.com about a potential vulnerability in SPL, didn't get a response yet. Just wanted to make sure it didn't get lost/see if there's a better channel for reporting
ETA on token-list PR merges?
Hm, the best way would be to create them on a pda from your program, or to do `create_with_seed` with some special data
A kind of tagging that says: hey I created those ones
Can I do a specific thing in the stake accounts I create, so that I only get those, and not the other stake accounts that the user creates (in other dApps, for example)?

Sorry, I have no idea.
<@!470799930227949618> https://discord.gg/p2K4padWr6
Do I need to pay to use the service?
Thanks
Okk
Wait, let me send one.
I have seen multiple discord servers use that to verify holders.
I mean I wanna check if my users have my own NFT, not the grape token xd 

Their tool seems to work only with their tokens.
The reason is because I was toying with the idea of setting up CI for on-chain programs where it is automatically deployed to devnet on each push, and maybe run some tests too.
Oh and this is a VM
No I have not.
OS is Ubuntu 18.04
I have not tried deploying to a local validator, I might try it tomorrow.
‚úã Newbie question
Hi all! I am very new to Solana
looking for help understanding account.data here:

```rust
// hello world program
#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Debug)]
pub struct GreetingAccount {
    pub counter: u32,
}

pub fn process_instruction(
    program_id: &Pubkey, 
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    _instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
    msg!("Hello World Rust program entrypoint");
    let accounts_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let account = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;
    if account.owner != program_id {
        msg!("Greeted account does not have the correct program id");
        return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId);
    }
    let mut greeting_account = GreetingAccount::try_from_slice(&account.data.borrow())?;
    greeting_account.counter += 1;
    greeting_account.serialize(&mut &mut account.data.borrow_mut()[..])?;
    msg!("Greeted {} time(s)!", greeting_account.counter);
    Ok(())
}
```

Here, I have confusion understanding `let mut greeting_account = GreetingAccount::try_from_slice(&account.data.borrow())?;` 

How is it possible that deserializing the `account.data` gives us **GreetingAccount** datatype?? 
Don't we have to explicitly define first that `account.data` will be storing certain datatype first before accessing it ??
u havent deployed on this system tho yet?  whats the os/model.  not really sure why this would continue to fail. after closing buffers, with blockhash expired?         outside of a connection issue, possible port blocked or not allowed, possibly by a firewall or some other issue.   Have you tried deploying to local validator?
Okay one second
Well I need to see the code somehow.
After they have been edited
Would I need to upload my template pages onto github?
the bleeding edge
Yes, I can run other commands like balance, account, airdrop.
The setup was installing rustup, installing the solana sdk, compiling and deploying.
ping gives me the same, assuming the rest will too :((
I don‚Äôt have the template uploaded on git
this is a new system then u havent been able to deploy with before?  but u can run other commands?  whats the new system setup?
I mean I just have the candy machine code on their
It is but it‚Äôs on private
If your code is on GitHub then I don't mind taking a look.
The host doesn't really matter here.
Should I choose a different host or keep it at vercel?
I mean, I just used the react and connected to vercel host
Yes
I assume your website is in react?
Smaller programs, yes.
This is a new deploy.
I managed to deploy using a different system, but it still doesn't work on the original one.
And I have a website template that I will just edit with what I need but I have no idea how to connect the candy machine coding where users can then go on my website that has the edited template and mint or connect wallet
I have this file already
i assume you have been able to deploy before? is this a new deploy or an upgrade?  are you still getting the blockhash expired error?
I‚Äôm not sure how to do that are there any guides
All you need is candymachine.ts and the `mintOneToken` function from https://github.com/exiled-apes/candy-machine-mint
Yeah like I have the basic candy machine code where it takes me to the localhost and I see connect wallet and mint w supply and all that stuff. But I have a template for a website and I want to combine the two so the minting button and connect wallet are on the website template that I have
Ah I can help with that.
The progress is still stuck at 0.0%
Haven't really been bothering to close buffer accounts since this devnet, but resuming doesn't seem to help.
you could run a `ping`, `program deploy`,  `transfer` `spl-token create-token`
are you referring to candy machine code in a program or on the front end from client? 
you can generally use a template as a starter of some kind,  if you know how to 'combine'.  this would either take some time and learning or developer knowledge though.  there would not be any 'auto' combine.
i loaded rust onto it so its all working via terminal
https://spl.solana.com/token and im on mac.
what kind of system are you on?  and what tutorial are u following?
i am able to run other commands though
you can also run logging in another window,   new terminal `solana logs -v `  
have you tried resuming a deploy and or closing the existing buffers?
https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program#resuming-a-failed-deploy
yeh - i'm really new to this stuff so i'm not sure what half of that stuff means - i followed the tutorial on the solana dev page and it got me the error.
its possible a node being load balanced might have a certificate issue. that can be looked into. in the few queries I made I did not see any cert issue. in the mean time you may want to try another RPC or network instance?  are you able to run other commands?
And no, `-v` prints my config but gives no additional information.

what do you see if you execute `solana program show --buffers` ?  typically if failed you should be able to close out or resume a deploy. and it seems your not receiving anymore info running verbose?
When I do ‚Äòspl-token create-token‚Äô it says ‚Äòerror sending request for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com/): error trying to connect : invalid certificate : UnknownIssuer.
 getting this issue when i try to make a new token... anyone got a fix? thanks!!!!
Is there a way I can buy a website template online and somehow combine my candy machine code to the new template?
what other commands can i try to check?
typically u can just install over the last version, or rm the contents of the cli folder and run install i spose its something you can try.. though not sure why you would get that for airdrop.   do you get that for any other commands?
not sure how to go about that tbqh
should i downgrade my cli version then?
hey <@!455114989397868556> quick question - when the Solana team approves PRs to add new tokens, do you verify the metadata on those tokens? For example, if they are linking a twitter and discord account to the token, do you verify that the person that submitted the PR is from the team and not a scammer?
not sure.  but i dont believe the devnet is on that version. dont think that should make a difference for airdrop tho.  ` solana cluster-version`  for other things it may make a diff when the cluster version and cli are out of sync.  i can run airdrop on a few other CLI version but I dont have one with 1.9.0.
Why can't they be sent out as and when they are done?
What I don't understand is why must the transactions restart if the blockhash changes?
This is devnet.
usually a deploy is a series of transactions.  if you run a log window you can see them execute. and u can see the status of the transactions as they get executed.  are you running a local validator?  or is this another network?
solana --version is `solana-cli 1.9.0 (src:devbuild; feat:490335049)`
heres my current config
i always get `Method not found` when trying to use devnet rpc
been having this problem for ages now. does anyone have any idea whats going wrong here?
I am running with -v now, but what do you mean by any of the deploy transactions?
It ticks up to 228/232 before failing.
does it succeed with any of the deploy transactions? anything more in logs or -v flags when running?
When I do ‚Äòspl-token create-token‚Äô it says ‚Äòerror sending request for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com): error trying to connect : invalid certificate : UnknownIssuer.
Is there an API that returns a slot given a UTC timestamp in the past?
Hi
Thanks for replying.
I am using the latest version of the cli, tried reinstalling too.
I don't think any ports are blocked, but the connection might be laggy.
I am trying to deploy a largish program with `solana program deploy`
what version of CLI are you using? have you tried updating it?
is it connection related? a blocked port or lagged connection?
anymore info in logs or running `-v` verbose? 
whats the command your executing.
Thanks for the docs
the SPL-Token is the standard for Token. https://spl.solana.com/token   you can add token meta data right now here: https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list
and metaplex is the standard for NFT:  https://docs.metaplex.com/ 
more docs are coming soon, but you can create and add these in different ways with web3, clients, cli, and more.
it can take up to 2 weeks to merge the PR and based on the app or explorer based on their time frame for refreshing their instance of the token list.
What issue are you having?
This may help, check the "Specification" tab: https://borsh.io/

Hello i'm a go backend / devops engineer, i'm starting with blockchain programming.

I've check Ethereum and solidity about how it's work, and as i understand, 

- ERC20 is the standard interface for Token
- EIP-721 is the standard interface for NFT.

To create them, we need to make a small solidity program maching the right functions.

Please correct me if i'm wrong but i see to create a token or a NFT people only use the solana cli...
i see we can then create programs.

What is the idea ? cli create a token and then create programs that interact with it ? should we "recode" the token if we want to add specifics stuff ?! ?
Hi team, I create a token base on solana, and I also create pull request to update token name and logo on token-list repo, So how long does it take for token name and logo to appear on solscan?
Can someone help me with this please? Thanks
ok ok, thank you
I dunno - I mean it could even be a variable size, given that some enum values can contain associated values. If it's in your control you can decide for yourself rather than just going with whatever borsh does.
Hi team, I create a token base on solana, and I also create pull request to update token name and logo on token-list repo, So how long does it take for token name and logo to appear on solscan?
Borsh, but serialize in storage, not `instruction_data`
You could serialise it however you like - if it only has 3 values you might use just 2 bits, if it has 65 values you might use 7 bits. Or are you asking how a particular pre-existing serialisation technique does it?
Anyone know a fix? Cheers!

How to bulk transfer of different nfts from one wallet to another?
Hi there, me and my team are looking for a long term developer who would like to join our team. Our project is on solana and we would need our developer to do a smart contract work, art generation, and our utility where every Island would have different minerals and then you could stake the Island and get your token airdropped with $MINERAL token which we would need to be created and preferably putting our website together with given design (but that is not necessary). We already got around 1200 members combined in our socials and we would like to pay you with % after mint, you could just include your wallet in the smart contract, or if you are really trusted we could pay a bit upfront. 

So please solana developers please dm!

Hey ! New(bie) on blockchain ! I would like to integrate Solana as main payment solution (& authentication ?) for my SaaS, but I cannot visualize the flow integration. What i guess:
- I create transaction with SDK (phantom wallet)
- send signature to my backend (?)
and after that ?
- How can I validate/verify payment and give access to Saas ?
- Can I check ownership of a wallet and give access to his user space safely ?
PDA just like a normal account but using program to sign.
> I confuse that one of account property is if get 0 balance, it'll be deleted. But user wallet don't be
yes. you can transfer all your SOL out on devnet and try to use getAccountInfo.
you will find that the account don't exist.
it just mean your data not on chain but you still hold the private key.
Hello guys.

Is user wallet also account which hold the data like PDA?
(PDA's owner is SystemProgram, User wallet's also same)

I confuse that one of account property is if get 0 balance, it'll be deleted. But user wallet don't be

Are the two concepts different?
Yes, see the `spl-token` cli
Would you recommend using Solana as a dev platform? Or rather, what would your advice be for someone seeking to becoming a blockchain dev today?
I've been looking at Cardano as well. From what I can figure, they don't have full support for Smart Contracts yet (?) but they have a couple of technologies - Marlowe and Plutus for devs. Aside from the Anchor framework, is there something similar for Solana?
Hey folks, just curious - been looking around at blockchain-related dev jobs. As expected, most are for Solidity for Ethereum. Looking at the Solana dev resources, it's very barebones (probably expected as well given its age). So my question is - are there any plans for developing a dev platform like Solidity+ for Solana? As in, does it make sense to start off with blockchain dev with Solana (new to this whole domain, more interested in the dev aspects).
<@!354039506740969472> did you get an answer for this?

Hi guys. Just wondering if theres any CLI command to transfer NFTs between wallets?
I used to work on some really cool virtualisation tech back in 2006-8, had LLVM targeting a virtual architecture spec., then per-architecture translators to do the final op-code translation, register allocation, optimisation... - and we were always having endianness and alignment issues. I'm quite rusty on all this low-level stuff though from doing apps for so long.
good luck building in docker!
this was indeed an adventure, i'll make and issue and a PR that fixes it tomorrow

```
    Program log: Greeted 1 time(s)!

Well I saw the core devs mention that they need more people helping to make it work on M1, so you can probably help out a bit there. Looks like you've already written a minimal working example so GH it üòÑ
which can vary per platform (and is therefore wrong)
but solana code derives an 8 byte offset from the abi offset for a u128
yep
I guess they have different ABIs?
amazing
```

     Running `target/debug/alignment`

```
align_of is throwing things off
Ok - so align_of returns the alignment requirement, rather than aligned-to.... that's not what's throwing you off is it?
yeah i'm cross compiling an x86 binary to see if it's different
(which is presumably running on x86)
Can you add a test to prove it?
https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=cb3149306834b076afe7e279e9cdbfab returns 8
i wonder if this is because my solana is a native arm64 executable
https://giphy.com/gifs/curbyourenthusiasm-curb-your-enthusiasm-larry-david-XyhHwzoqczHO4AWKiY
in the validator `align_of::<u128>()` returns 16, in an ebf program it returns 8
Well that's weird
yeah goddamn
amazingly... this aligns to 8 bytes, even though a u128 is... 16 bytes?
```
offset += (offset as *const u8).align_offset(align_of::<u128>());
```
...docs say "enough padding to align the offset to 8 bytes."
(one aligns by 16 bytes, the other by 8)
it seems that rust's align_offset is doing different things between the validator and my ebf program
maybe not
Was it a bug then?
now etched into my zsh history
found it on the internet somewhere and it worked

How do you know to do that? The docs say to just `cargo build; cargo test`
and that's worked out of the box for me (m1 mac pro)
but haven't looked into what it does
i usually run ./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh
That's how cargo seems to work, yeah
are you trying to build the whole world?
gut-feel is some weird race conditions in the build process?
wow i think i found a real bug in solana (edit: pondering)
...tests now running. Had to re-run `cargo build` once to get it to finish, had to re-run `cargo test` about 8 times until it completed them all. Very weird
It seems to report building 1020/1045 and then fails as it gets to the end, then next time it starts a bit higher, 1026/1045, etc. - repeatedly running `cargo test` until it gets there
you may need to ldconfig to slurp up new dynamic libraries?
Yeah
is this in docker?
mm no
Getting similar errors doing `cargo test` too.
Is it normal that `cargo build` fails the first time (cc can't link) then passes if you do it again straight afterwards?
Actually - I was trying to make it minimal and add-in as needed, but maybe I should go the other way
fair point
There are probably some `apt-get` needed in the Dockerfile. I based it of the CI one as I figured that's what CI uses, so it must work
and a non obvious thing about rust is that nightly does not just mean "a release after the latest and before the next" but it also means "the latest release plus a bunch of secret magic features that haven't officially stabilized but everyone uses anyway"
(but master of solana repo)
no I have `FROM rust:1.56.0`
it feels bad but basically everyone uses nightly rust
are you running nightly?
but yeah - `cargo build` doesn't even complete. I'll go poking around in the `ci/docker-rust/Dockerfile` to see if there are any clues in there.
Well yeah - given that people seem to use packages willy-nilly and nobody except governments actually mirrors and audits them... well, who knows what you're opening yourself up to
_winces at npm install scripts_
I did some research as part of learning about npm/node (for building the docs) and decided it's probably not a good idea to even have npm installed on my host, and only ever run it from a container.
Pop! os (ubuntu based)
what platform is your host?
Well I can't even build solana yet, so you're doing good üòÑ - on that note, why on earth don't they provide a Dockerfile so you actually know what the build env is supposed to be?
(although i'm splicing around the solana validator code to better understand the logic here)
nah, this is not my code that's indexing through this buffer, it's standard solana runtime stuff (unless you're writing your own entrypoint code you don't even see this raw buffer)
Well, maybe you're supposed to manually read the u64 data size, add 8+ that number offset and (the equivalent of) reinterpret-cast that address?
since this is a hello world i could shrink it to 0 bytes but i'd still be 8 bytes off
it's just meaningless intentional garbage
What are the 1, 2, 3, 4 instruction data all about?
it just takes years between each slot
ü§£
in other news, setting max compute units to 200 million rather than 200k so that you can log a really long buffer... does not work
i can imagine it's quite overwhelming!
12 hugely successful years as an ios/android contractor, but I'm just bored with it these days - there's no challenge there any more, and in terms of innovation on mobile, there are no big leaps any more, only tiny steps. So I decided to learn crypto/blockchain (solana only for now) and of course having to learn web, js, node, rust, and a whole bunch of other stuff in parallel.
(actually 12 years!)
always - I've been Mac-only for the last 10 years too, so forgot almost everything about linux
(and thus forget everything you just learned heh)
but once it's done you can usually depend on it to not break down the line, which is nice
nice! yeah, docker can be a real trial and error process to set up
btw your hint to use volta really helped - I'm a mobile dev, never used node/npm before, so never heard of it. I got a working Dockerfile now. Nice and simple. Never has it taken me this long to write 6 lines of config.
so seems unlikely that's the issue
it looks like the solana runtime intuits deprecated vs non-deprecated loaders by looking at exported symbols
(that said, this feels like the kind of thing that if it changed between solana releases... everyone's programs would break)
(but I've written none of the code responsible for either so likely something versioney)
(binary incompatibility)
It does look as if the compiled offset is incorrect - so yeah an incorrect version could be the cause.
so either the loader is packing parameters wrong or rust is unpacking them wrong
appreciate it üôÇ
I don't really know what I'm on about tbh - just being a rubber duck that talks back randomly - it sometimes helps
i wonder if i've somehow opted into the deprecated BPF Loader (https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust#parameter-deserialization)
...could it be that the struct changed at some point, so the compiled offset of `.program_id` is 0 but in the actual data it should be 12?
it's the instruction data (of length 4 in this case)
- 8 bytes of unsigned number of instruction data
- x bytes of instruction data
Could it be a u64 = 4 (8 bytes) followed by 1, 2, 3, 4 as 4 separate bytes for some reason?
Interesting - looks 12 bytes over, struct packing issue?
Hi Friends. I am trying to make a Solana contract where I want to store secret information that is not accessible to the world. Is there any way by which I can save some sort of secret without making it public?
Ok, I'm getting somewhere: I changed the instruction data and that twiddles the raw bytes of what is being interpreted as the "program id." From looking at the rust entrypoint macro, it seems that the program_id is the last thing to be passed to the program, so if anything before it is the wrong size then we're gonna have a bad time. And indeed, if I look at the respective found vs expected program id i find the expected program id shifted over by some number of bytes:
```
// Found program id
Uint8Array(32) [
    4,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   1,
    2,   3,   4, 141, 120, 196,  85, 255,  30,
  240,  33, 203,   9,   1,  41, 142,  55, 143,
  130, 229,  11,  30, 226
]
// Expected program id

  189, 159,  34, 196, 201, 121,  18,  83
]
```
FIXED

This was accessing anchor through a node module vs. through cargo, so I removed the node module and it is working again

~~~~~

hey team -- would love some help for me, a newb

I'm getting the following response when I run `anchor test`
```Only x86_64 / Linux distributed in NPM package right now.
Trying globally installed anchor.
Globally installed anchor version is not correct. Expected "anchor-cli 0.18.2", found "anchor-cli 0.18.0".```

any tips on how to fix this?
the rust dockerfiles look to be based on debian so you could probably apt-get something but I personally prefer to use volta.sh to setup node, so you'd just put the install commands as RUN lines in your dockerfile
Hey, I got this resolved earlier. Still appreciate you took the time to answer, this place always provides help when I ask for it. Thank you! üôè
Hey how would I go about finding which wallet holds the most of a nft collection?
Would it be beneficial to include a Dockerfile in the solana repo so that we can all use a common build environment? I'm curious why this isn't already the case.
Coming from mobile apps development on a mac, it's a whole other world - so many things for me to learn in parallel!
(also - do people run `npm install` directly on their dev machine rather than in a container? this seems like a security risk to me)
I'm trying to make a Docker file for a solana build environment, but I am new to docker, and can't figure out how to get one with the rust needs and also npm for building the docs. If I'm basing it on `rust:1.56.0` how would I get npm as well? I figure I have to add an apt source and run apt, but I don't know how to find what source to use that will work with the rust base image - does it matter?
and hi üòÑ
what the best way to  getting started with solana for a guy who knows eth base stuff quite well (typescript)
the bpf toolkit is using rustc 1.52.1-dev, edition2021 is 1.56+
the bpf builder is still 2018
üëÄ i'm using 2021 (and failing to get anything to work).... i wonder if this is why
are you planning on supporting rust edition2021 anytime soon on the build-bpf sdk?
derp yes, right... something with the calling convention seems borked though. perhaps the non-jitted code path doesn't get enough coverage to remain functional
M1 is little-endian.
I'm running from source so I guess the next thing to do here is to drop various print statements in the test validator to see if there's an endianness bug or something
Anyone have ideas? I suppose the main weird thing here is that I'm running on an M1 Mac without the JIT (because the jit doesn't work on arm64)
Ok, I'm trying to reconstruct the hello world examples from scratch and I'm baffled because the rust hello world example prints out a program_id that is... not the program ID, see the decoded transaction (and simulation) below...

GcdayuLaLyrdmUu4zP2UJf4WCyLqwLT17GvVr9JzKhK is not an ID anywhere on my local environment and is clearly _not_ the program id. Decoding into bytes results in:

```
Uint8Array(32) [
    4,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,
    0,   0,   0, 189,  87, 250, 161,   7, 107,
   48,  89, 191, 145, 197, 234, 150, 247,  12,
  145, 147,  75, 214, 231
]
```
which given the number of zeroes suggests to me that memory has / is being corrupted somewhere (because usually keys have more entropy), evidently as part of the call signature / API for my more or less copy of the rust hello world code.
Not sure if you've got an answer yet.

```javascript
    const network = WalletAdapterNetwork.Devnet;
    const endpoint = useMemo(() => clusterApiUrl(network), [network]);
```

the `network` is just a string. so if you want to connect to localhost.

you could do something like:

```diff
-   const network = WalletAdapterNetwork.Devnet;
+   const network = 'http://127.0.0.1:8899' // whatever the correct address is

    const endpoint = useMemo(() => clusterApiUrl(network), [network]);
```
can we write inline eBPF asm yet <:prayge:827318436870488135>
Thanks 0xmev... ideally we don't want to pay for the initialisation üôÇ We'd like the recipients to pay initialisation, and then we transfer the tokens to them for cheap cheap.
Do you guys have a piece of code to get the nfts in a specific wallet, with the metadata?
What are these images? <https://hub.docker.com/r/solanalabs/solana/tags>


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

no. whats the transaction signature and what network?
All sending to burn address does is create a new account and transfer the token to it
The SPL Token program has an explicit burn instruction that should be issued
what you mean?
Nothing, burn it properly please
where does that money go?
there is a small amount of money (rent?) that is used to hold metadata in place
what happens if we send a NFT to the burn address?
Hay could someone give me a little help? I not sure how to use discord yet so forgive me if I‚Äôm asking in the wrong place‚Ä¶.
I‚Äôm aware That if I send my coins to the wrong wallet they can‚Äôt be retrieved, but when I type the address into solana explorer it says the assigned program id is a system program. Does that make any difference?
ah looks like i just wanna use the jsonprc api
how can I simulate a transaction using solana CLI? failing to find the cmd
Trying to fetch a list of token accounts associated with owner's publickey. I've used getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner() to retrieve Array<{publickey, accounts}>. I am confused how I iterate through this array of objects and access "accounts" within each?
Ah, I figured it out:

```
Transaction.populate(
  response.transaction.message,
  response.transaction.signatures
)
```
Is there a simple way to take a processed transaction (obtained with `connection.getTransaction(signature)`) and recompose it into a `Transaction` with `TransactionInstructions`? I see you could get `processed.transaction.message.accountKeys`, `processed.transaction.message.instructions`, and some other values and piece it back together, but I'm wondering if there's a utility to do this already.
I also fixed the issue with this wrong folder, it makes it impossible to checkout on windows
I don't have the rights to merge and don't really know where to ask
Hello, would it be possible for a Mod or someone to review this small PR ?
https://github.com/solana-labs/ecosystem/pull/752
sounds fun, do you know of any example case that I can watch of an extended spl implementation?
Hi Everyone,
I really need some guidance on where to start and process to follow in order to start writing solana contracts and integrate them with our application. Would be really helpful if someone can guide me to the proper channel/advice. 
Thanks.
Internally the source code breaks down into multiple signatures, and you can see the public keys being verified in `nacl.sign.detached.verify`. The source code should show the full breakdown
Check out the `verifySignatures` function on web3 https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/b45f065/src/transaction.ts#L545
So suppose i got the signature of a transaction, how can i find the person that sent the transaction ?
<@!785084693023424542> Beautiful. Thank you so much.
https://spl.solana.com/token#finding-all-token-accounts-for-a-specific-mint
In Swift it's called an "Enum with associated values" for example.
Question - is there a way to download the addresses of all holders of a particular SPL token?
That's all a Rust enum is, really, when you look under the hood. I call it a discriminated union, but it goes by other names: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union>
ull need to verify the accounts and instructions, and the balances, that are participating, as well as the network, and making sure your viewing and using the right networks in both the connection endpoint and the wallet network config in the actual wallet.
you can file and update the github issue(s) pertaining to this under solana for explorer. this issue has been looked into. uncertain on an eta. you can update any existing issue(s) with comments.
i am sending instruction from my frontend to phantom
in my wallet
i have 0.082 sol
if you have any suggestion any public node url I can try it
I see, I use my own node
that is not an endpoint.  an end point is the network address.
https://explorer.solana.com/address/8ymi88q5DtmdNTn2sPRNFkvMkszMHuLJ1e3RVdWjPa3s/metadata
sendTransaction endpoint. for sending a signed transaction
its saying insufficient lamports with 'number', may want to see where that is coming from? as that is what is being tapped for lamports
I would like to ask for a real fix for the Solana explorer again since it is still showing metadata connected to our token which doesnt belong there
no, and not have it inter-operate with the greater current spl-token eco system out of the box. you can customize or extend and deploy your own spl-token, a version that is not automatically compatible with the eco system. spl-token is evolving.
what is the actual end point?  and have you tried using an alternative?  your just sending a transaction, and it should get picked up by a caught up node.
i can do this in devnet but not in mainnet
there is no balance change in my program
i have sufficient transaction fee but still getting this error
i think we get this error when we don't have sufficient transaction fee right ?
hello are there ways to extend the standard spl-token program to do more things in basic functions like transfer?, the goal is to tax upon transfer (like burn some of the tokens when they are moved around)
"jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "error": {

any help?
Ok the curl command download the fille but its corrupt on that note obviously the second command cant run. Got it. Why the fuck it downloads corrupted haha
it shows a windows compatible install above..  if using ubuntu you probably want to download/install the linux compatible version..
Yhea im using Ubunto, let me check what I can do
that means the command your running is not found, so what your executing is not found or does not exist. if your using windows you may have to use `start path.exe` or some other command.  and know how to deal with spaces or other common windows terminal issues. 

I would also recommend WSL if your using windows. that way you can hopefully use a local test validator. I was not aware there was a good or recommended Solana CLI for windows yet, with a compatible solana-test-validator.
yes
it's already sync but broadcast tx endpoint gives error
solana mainnet. it is not catching up actually. it's like that last 3 days. around 200-600 slots behind
what network? hmm you may have to wait, try again, or use a different rpc endpoint?  the particular node seems to be behind and catching up.
the error at the bottom says `  'Create Account: account Address { address: 8tC3GUcxduDJ4KW63xdfiQaGxHoQ6oaF5b73n2KAouoa, base: None } already in use',`  ?

Hey
I'm developing a token-swap Dapp for education, using token-swap app from Solana program library.

I've initiated all necessary accounts but when I try to create a TokenSwap class I receive a vague error message.

the error happens when a method is trying to send a transaction, which is a transaction for creating an account for token-swap program I've deployed earlier
If you need more content, be sure to check out this https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/pull/2579/files Has arch diagrams that will likely be pulled sometime in the future.
Awesome
Maybe too small for a library, but maybe included into the web3 decoder lib
This is great! Would be great to have it in a pluggable library so that other people using borsh can have quick access to it as well
FWIW I tried an approach to borsh serializing instance objects from JS to Rust enums that seems to work alright. I put together some of the relevant files in a gist here: https://gist.github.com/dgabriele/7207367dffb7461adca589f123029a8a#file-serializing-ts-L1 -- the last file "serializing.ts" shows how I'm using it. In a nutshell, I implemented some typescript decorators that build up the borsh schema object from class and property definitions. Then I have `fromBuffer` and `toBuffer` methods that perform the underlying serialization. The Rust code is shortened down to one line: https://gist.github.com/dgabriele/7207367dffb7461adca589f123029a8a#file-instruction-rs-L14. In a nutshell, the JS side sends the instruction data as a struct, except with the Rust enum's variant int code as the first byte. Based on the discussion here: https://github.com/near/borsh-js/issues/21
This is all being made easier in the rewrite, but unknown when it will be pulled in
You would create a custom function that takes payer as an additional option that has the same internals as `getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo`, but calls your own function instead of `createAssociatedTokenAccountInternal`, passing `payer`. Then you would have the exact same code in `createAssociatedTokenAccountInternal` https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/c6758a697c135baff7cf5754b4d1b7a30300dbcd/token/js/client/token.js#L505 but setting the payer to the payer param pased
There is a rewrite going on that will allow you to set the payer in the future
will be back in a while
could you guide me on how to do that, I'm just a beginner
Yes, that is correct
I see, so I would need to add the transaction instruction myself to mint the account
Yes, always a good place to start!
thanks alot üôÇ yeah I was slowly working this out, typically this would be defined in the `state.rs` file of  aproject no?
You can see that `getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo` calls `createAssociatedTokenAccountInternal` internally with the owner as the payer
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/c6758a697c135baff7cf5754b4d1b7a30300dbcd/token/js/client/token.js#L536
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/c6758a697c135baff7cf5754b4d1b7a30300dbcd/token/js/client/token.js#L509
Right, because the receiving account doesn't have money to pay for the transaction. You're using `await getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo`, which internally is making a transaction with the `owner` sent as the `payer`. If you want to make the `sender` the `payer`, you'll have to construct you're own transaction for creating the account
You need to know how the account program data was serialized by the program and then deserialize it in your script
the error only occurs when the receiving account doesn't have a USDC minted account
the keypair thats being generated
but thats for the sender's wallet right?
It won't be able to pay for the transaction fees
The new keypair you generated doesn't have any funds
This is the complete code I have right now
it works when you try it with someone who has a USDC account on his wallet
only for the receiver who doesn't have a USDC account minted*

I am using this right now, but it shows that it was unable to fetch account information for the receiver
that's the issue, it showed an error like:

```Confirming the transaction took more than 60 seconds```
Use `getOrCreatedAssociatedAccountInfo` https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/examples/create_mint_and_transfer_tokens.js#L34
Also one more thing, how would I go about minting a USDC account for an address that doesn't have one from web3.js
`confirmTransaction` will still work
You have to use the spl-token library in order to construct the transactions. https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/examples/create_mint_and_transfer_tokens.js
How would I go about confirming SPL transactions?
but doesn't work on SPL transactions
this works on solana transactions
```js
import { Connection } from '@solana-labs/web3.js'

const connection = new Connection(.....)

connection.confirmTransaction(.....)
```
My biggest challenge has been finding structure to how i begin to study, theres programing, forensics, overall blockchain tech...so ive kinda been all over the place
Or at least have a good understanding of Borsh
Yeah! i feel forensics is up my alley
Even with the second option, it'll be good to learn rust to understand how to decode the data in the transactions
Rust will really help you understand and be able to audit the programs. However, you could go after more transaction forensics, where you could use a bunch of js to find and follow transactions
Ive been doing some basic JS to them move into Rust...do you think it is worthwhile to pursue?
Feel free to ping here if you need any more help. We're happy to have you
Oh wow, ty <@!489206164270350337> will review all of the documentation!
Someone set up a page to keep track of bug bounties here as well https://unequaled-billboard-258.notion.site/Bug-Bounties-on-Solana-537dd7e20862436c9f91f9bbde2202d5. You can review previous bugs and how they were found through that
Hello
Sounds awesome and we'd love to have you. You can try going through neodyme's audit workshop here https://workshop.neodyme.io/index.html
We'll be uploading the full 3 hour in person workshop from last week soon. I would also make sure you understand Solana's account model https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts and maybe review programs and their audits https://github.com/solendprotocol/solana-program-library/tree/master/token-lending/audit
<:facepalm:895074146550153236>  the python example was using devnet it seems, I'll check this one, thank you so much
https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com is mainnet-beta rpc
Top right button on the UI. Or you can change your `connection` to use mainnet-beta
How do I connect to mainnet instead?
how can i read the data output from a `getAccountInfo` query?
```
let info;
  info = await connection.getAccountInfo(tokenSwapAccount.publicKey);
  if (info != null) {
    console.log(info.data.toString('hex'));
  }
```
https://explorer.solana.com/address/MEisE1HzehtrDpAAT8PnLHjpSSkRYakotTuJRPjTpo8?cluster=devnet Shows a bunch of signatures
Are you sure you're searching with devnet selected on the explorer?
Are you talking about how people update the ERC20 token to add changes to the `transfer` function? spl-token is done a little differently, as you cannot update the program. You can, however, wrap the program with another and create ux that incentivizes using that wrapper. This won't stop people from using the underlying program though
0 clue, others might be able to help you
can you pls share some info on how to create fungible tokens with custom seller fees, and how to whitelist wallets from those fees?
If this is spam i will delete this lol - Im a 12 year Network Sec enginner (tcp/ip) looking to get into the blockchain space (Forensics, Sec Analyst, Audit) not really a coder but decent at linux. just looking for advise/suggestions on skills to aqcuire to help me out on a new journey
if you open sol scan and check any of the tokens, the seller fee is visible on the page
also is this RPC node up to date? `https://api.devnet.solana.com` or is it delayed by a few days?
```python
account = solana.publickey.PublicKey('MEisE1HzehtrDpAAT8PnLHjpSSkRYakotTuJRPjTpo8')
res = await client.get_signatures_for_address(account=account)```
Hey guys, I'm using `get_signatures_for_address` to get transactions from a certain address, however, none of the returned "signatures" are searchable on the block explorer, what is the issue? ü§î
So, the `try_from_slice` above should reflect how you serialize your instruction and data for that instruction on the front-end
Thanks <@!814228493302497301> - I've been blocked for a minute now. Hadn't thought about trying your approach before
hello I have been using the search function and can't find any hint, can the tokenomics from ethereum contracts be emulated in solana tokens? specifically the sale-fee, considering sol tokens are traded in dex markets. Please some hint would be very much appreciated
I see.... interesting
Keep in mind that the way I serialize the instruction buffer is for my program, your mileage may vary
With enum:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
/// All custom program instructions
pub enum ProgramInstruction {
    InitializeAccount,
    MintToAccount { key: String, value: String },
    TransferBetweenAccounts { key: String },
    BurnFromAccount { key: String },
    MintToAccountWithFee { key: String, value: String },
    TransferBetweenAccountsWithFee { key: String },
    BurnFromAccountWithFee { key: String },
}
```
Often times your instruction is a `u8` (byte) that on the Rust side uses a `match` on that and then takes the appropriate enum variant to instantiate it with any of the data fields following the instruction number:
```rust
impl ProgramInstruction {
    /// Unpack inbound buffer to associated Instruction
    /// The expected format for input is a Borsh serialized vector
    pub fn unpack(input: &[u8]) -> Result<Self, ProgramError> {
        let block = Vec::<Vec<u8>>::try_from_slice(input).unwrap();
        match block[0][0] {
            0 => Ok(ProgramInstruction::InitializeAccount),
            1 => Ok(Self::MintToAccount {
                key: String::try_from_slice(&block[1])?,
                value: String::try_from_slice(&block[2])?,
            }),
            2 => Ok(Self::TransferBetweenAccounts {
                key: String::try_from_slice(&block[1])?,
            }),
            3 => Ok(Self::BurnFromAccount {
                key: String::try_from_slice(&block[1])?,
            }),
            4 => Ok(Self::MintToAccountWithFee {
                key: String::try_from_slice(&block[1])?,
                value: String::try_from_slice(&block[2])?,
            }),
            5 => Ok(Self::TransferBetweenAccountsWithFee {
                key: String::try_from_slice(&block[1])?,
            }),
            6 => Ok(Self::BurnFromAccountWithFee {
                key: String::try_from_slice(&block[1])?,
            }),
            _ => Err(SampleError::DeserializationFailure.into()),
        }
    }
}
```
I mean, how do you guys normally communicate instructions of different types to the same solana program without using an enum for the instruction data? Are you guys sending plain structs with type codes or something?
I've been banging my head against the wall, trying to borsh serialize instruction data from a NodeJS client to Rust, where I'm trying to deserialize it as an enum variant. Not having much success, I'm wondering if there is a prohibitive reason why not to use serde JSON for this purpose? I know that JSON is "slow", but in my use case, the size of the data is very small. Are there other security vulnerabilities that come into play if I chose to use JSON instead of borsh for serialization of instruction data?
how can i get a list of all spl tokens owned on an address
(`curl` isn't exactly the easiest way to quickly get info though)
Yeah I think you can find it in the RPC API too (can't quite remember) but not from the CLI
Ah stupid me.
I can look at transaction error in the explorer.
I might just give up trying to contribute and focus on writing something to run on top of solana instead. A safer wallet might be a good idea considering how crappy and easily scammable the popular ones seem to be.
My native OS is Pop! OS and I won't install node/npm in my native machine. Needed for building the docs (and the docs actually require you to build the CLI for one of the files)
I've got that in a VirtualBox VM. Maybe it's trying to do symlinks outside the git directory or something strange.
You can try a clean ubuntu 20.04 environment
I don't know, did not really work with rust before üôÇ
I tried cargo build with -vv before and didnt' get anything more informative. Is there another place for cargo logs?
Not if your balance stays above the rent-exempt minimum. Do `solana rent 0` for more info.
Interesting, I did not get that error. Are there any other messages near in the log?
The principle of rent is not quite clear. If I, as a user, only make transfers of SOL and tokens, do I have to pay rent?
I get the same result: could not compile libsecp256k1 caused by `process didn't exit successfully: rustc --crate-name libsecp256k1 --edition=2018 <blah>`
I assume this error when sending transaction
```
Error: Transaction failed: Custom program error: 0xa
```
came from this error code?
    `UNBALANCED_INSTRUCTION = 10;`
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/11153e1f87a548723376bb2ad1e4c29a950c2f11/storage-proto/proto/transaction_by_addr.proto#L67
or from

https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/11153e1f87a548723376bb2ad1e4c29a950c2f11/storage-proto/proto/transaction_by_addr.proto#L37
Any idea what's wrong?
```python
async with AsyncClient("https://api.devnet.solana.com") as client:
    res = await client.get_confirmed_signature_for_address2('6S6QwdhVwNtRCx53wVqCN9esZbkvWarjwTXwBFugCyav')

but I'm getting an empty result, I tried multiple accounts with the same result. ```{'jsonrpc': '2.0', 'result': [], 'id': 1}
```
Hello, I'm using the python client, I'm trying to get list of transactions for an address, I'm using the following:
When I do ‚Äòspl-token create-token‚Äô it says ‚Äòerror sending request for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com/): error trying to connect : invalid certificate : UnknownIssuer.
 getting this issue when i try to make a new token... anyone got a fix? thanks
For now it's fixed at 5000, it doesn't change from slot-to-slot, but it might in the future. "Recent" apparently means 150 blocks, which is about 70-80 seconds I think. But there's conflicting information about this in the docs.
Nerver mind I use this instead. https://solfaucet.com/
For some reseason the `airdrop` and `balance` command in Solana cli doesn‚Äôt work for
solana-cli 1.8.2 (src:42a2c292; feat:52865992)
Hi!
1) recentBlockhash:
```
{
  blockhash: 'GhcvVcLm2EHuNwttbwF5Jjvirkv9nViNiZn99Db7hGyw',
  feeCalculator: { lamportsPerSignature: 5000 }
}
```
If I sign a tx with this blockhash and one signature, will i pay exactly 5000 lamports?
Can the fee for this blockhash change?

2) In docs: `as any transaction whose blockhash is too old will be rejected.`
How long is too long? Is it possible to show the actual fee to the user on the sending screen within 1 minute?
Currently I wasn't able to airdrop sol on devnet.
Is the faucet down?
```solana airdrop 5 2qLiUVKmQYYSKqzPDH1MR7BjjBy9Gcs6hZPtX2QkZH2P                                             
Requesting airdrop of 5 SOL
Error: airdrop request failed. This can happen when the rate limit is reached.```
Ok trying it now - seems a lot faster
If you already have cargo and rustc, then try the `sed`s
I installed rust using that script, but without the default toolchain option. Should I try again in a new VM from scratch, or is there a rustup command to do that equivalent?
If you already have the toolchain installed, then do `sed -i '/cargo=/s/^/#/' scripts/cargo-install-all.sh` and `sed -i 's/"$cargo"/cargo/g' scripts/cargo-install-all.sh` and then https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools#build-from-source
For you, the simplest solution might be `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain none` , then follow https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools#build-from-source
Anyone got an idea on how to trace/track NFT sales that happen on secondary marketplaces? For example when I query XXX token/NFT I see transactions for it, in token holders previous owners, etc. But for some reason on one marketplace it says that sale happened for that NFT, but I don't see it in explorer, only that it changed owner. Any idea on how to track it?
If you have a solution that even makes it build successfully please let me know how. The README either has wrong or missing steps, as it doesn't work on pristine systems.
So you want to use a different version of rust? I don't know much cargo/rust (I'm new to it) so I just followed what the solana docs said, and it says in the README to check `ci/rust-version.sh` and use that one, so I guess it expects that version. I still couldn't build it all though.
I'll probably open a PR with a suggested solution and see what the maintainers will tell
Well I don't want to use 1.56.0. Now I basically have to do changes to the scripts to make it work
Oh - my comment 2 up from here was supposed to be a reply to this
Looks like a property on an object, `isMutable` means "can this object be modified or not?" and `1` probably means "yes" (true). It's a strange encoding, especially if it's JSON since that has a native bool type... but that's how I'd interpret it.
Unfortunately the install instructions in the main README and in the "build from source" docs don't actually work. I've tried so many things, but I'm not a cargo/rust developer so I don't know how to make it work. In your case it sounds like `rustup install 1.56.0` might do the trick
What does "isMutable":1 refer to?
Hi! Is it possible to force the `cargo-install-all.sh` script to use the system cargo for installation? Right now the version check does not allow to use the apt version
I noticed ‚ÄògetTokenAccountsByOwner‚Äô, but it requires a filter as parameter.
So if i go on Solana explorer and type in a wallet address i can get a list of all tokens owned by that account. Which function in the api can be used to get similar results ?
Hi , How do i open token account for a user of SPL token by making transaction from frontend . Wallet used - Phantom.  Like i want to show a button  "Create Associated Token Account" on my website . Once he click that button , it redirects to phantom wallet to confirm the transaction .
i'd like to know how to make a lock-up staking pool for my own token which pays out in the token. any one know? i'd like to intergrate it to a website. thanks
I‚Äôm wondering too‚Ä¶ anyone know?
hello plz help, how can i see my Command Line Wallets in unity?
Hi all, does anyone have any good resources on implementing single staking pools, similar to what's on https://pancakeswap.finance/pools for example? Can this be done with existing Solana programs? Also, general resources on how the pools work and the math behind them would be very helpful.
Hey Dev Teammates, 
Has anyone created any projects in solana java ? Or anyone is the process of creating in java language ?
Can you please DM me, need some help. I am creating a project in solana java, and i am stuck, would need help.
hello Solana dev team, i'm gonna build solana lottery contract and am not sure how i can get random number on solana. i've used chainlink VRF to get random number in my past ethereum smart contracts, but not sure how i can get random number on solana smart contracts. when chainlink VRF is supported on solana or is there any other alternative solution?
When I do ‚Äòspl-token create-token‚Äô it says ‚Äòerror sending request for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com/): error trying to connect : invalid certificate : UnknownIssuer.
 getting this issue when i try to make a new token... anyone got a fix? thanks
thank you !
<@!788215642070581289>  you're the best thankyou.
for custom your instruction, maybe take a look at https://dev.to/cogoo/solana-how-to-send-custom-instructions-via-instruction-data-4g9g
the program call system program and token program. in token program it set authority (there are 4 type, not sure what kind here)
do you have any link , or example from where I can study on ?
Can someone tell me what is going on in the following program logs please?
Hi, guys!
I'm trying to interact with solana stake pool on my vue app with any success...
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/stake-pool

Mb someone can give me example how can I do it, or example how create instruction for it?
thanks
I don't think you can send it directly. you pack it into your instruction data. 
how to pack it depends on you. you can use borsh or your custom way.
the most important is that your client and your program should use the same serialize/deserialize method.
update authority will be stored in the token metadata account
https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/advanced/metaplex/get-tokenmeta.html
Guys any help on how to send a Vector of Strings from Client to Program trought RPC ?
I have the mint public key and am trying to get the update authroirt, any help is appreciated!
Hello, I am trying to get the update authority public key for an NFT through RPC, like this for example https://explorer.solana.com/address/9XR3S6g71evNrHdNM8JYYcHc2KCsa3goqS5F6MucdWZ2
(*and everyone knows vim is better anyway*)
probably the wrong chat to ask üòÑ
My different terminals aren't showing up for some reason
I need some help with a vs code issue
if i able to achieve this one , this will not only reduce the burning of rent fees on each and every associated account for my user but also will be easy to track different transactions of different user from metadata
i am just trying to create multiple associated account from single public key and i want to use the meta to track the different user transaction of token from a single wallet
What's the solana equivalent of chainlink VRF random numbers?
this seems counter intuitive. the idea behind associated token account is to easily reference 1 token account based on a primary address. what are you trying to do ?
and for meta data, for traditional spl-token standard, no - not to the spl-token itself.  you can send custom instructions in a transaction, and log, or memo, but im not sure in what sense you mean add meta data in token transactions. NFTs are different and have attached/referenced meta data and use SPL-Token underneath, so in that sense, you can accomplish something similar - but that doesnt mean everyone in the eco system will interact with it in the same way, if thats needed.
Ok, thanks for the hint <@!785084693023424542>
it also depends what you want to check for. on the web3 side, for a valid address format for a wallet, you could check with publicKey("") cast check mentioned above, and additionally check it that key is on curve with web3 PublicKey.is_on_curve.  You could additionally getAccountInfo to see if the account exists, and or getBalance, and if your checking a token account you may want to check for that (getToken.. or in the spl-token web3 getAssociatedTokenAddress, and simialr methods.
for the same token
Also is it possible to create multiple associated account for single token from one wallet ?
<@!788215642070581289> is there any possibilities  to add any meta data in token transactions ?
Any hint on this ?
Try to do `new PublicKey("address")` should be return an error if the address is not valid
Guys any help on this?
if it's irrelevant that's fine, but I still want to know what it's for
Hi , guys 
I have a method on my on-chain program who accept a  Vec<String> ,  this is the method:
 `  pub fn receive_list(
        list: Vec<String>
    ) -> ProgramResult {

        Ok(())
    }`
On the client side I have this method in order to send an array of Strings , 

 ` const tx = await anchorProgram.rpc.receiveList(
      ["String1","String2"],
    );
`
when I try to send the transaction I get this error 

 ` msg: 'The program could not deserialize the given instruction'`

Do you know how to send an array of strings without specifing the lentght of the array ?
If I send a simple single String (not Vec<String>) everything works fine
Thanks for your help
but then what's create_with_seed
so create_program_address and find_program_address I think I get now
haha well in rust if it compiles it most of the time *is* fine
wait, hang on
makes me sad
cryptography is the exception to Rust's "if it compiles, it works"
<@!137101040687382528> thanks for help, it really helped me to understand it best possible way
Step 1: Get it working
Step 2: Actually get it working
calling it now, it's gonna fail for some cryptographic reason I don't understand every step of the way
in JS: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L1109
we shall see
I think I might be equipped to finish the thing I'm working on now <:turbofish:448579316452818944>
i understand entire process and thanks to you .... just want to know if i have implement it as api format how i can do it
cool, thanks
I'd say yes, but someone correct me. Since it iterates through different bumps to find a valid one
<@!137101040687382528> can i know how i can close a account, because your given link only provides textual description. is there any method which is available in rpc call to close any solana account
Guys, can anyone help with this?
am I right about this, though?
but if it just wanted a 1d slice, it'd be hard to construct the full seed without a heap allocation
well i was thinking if it gets contiguous'd anyway, why bother with the two-dimensional bit
maybe it's ergonomic ü§î
I'm not sure about that part üòÖ I'm no rust expert and still learning a lot as well. Don't know what way the most 'rust-ey' would be
which also kind of explains why this seed stuff takes `&[&[u8]]`: to make this kind of thing ergonomic, right?
just use its bytes as one of the seeds
I think this also answers another question I had: how to set up several program-controlled token wallets, given some identifier (the address of an "associated" account in my case where I store metadata about who can "claim" funds and how much)
Guys do you knwo how to send a Vec<String> from js to on-chain program trought RPC ?
https://spl.solana.com/token#closing-accounts

Just to make it clear though - closing accounts and getting the rent back means that account (including all data stored in it) is gone and will get deleted for good
or is there different method to collect back rent amount from that account
understood, and to collect it back i only have to do a normal txn from rpc call with that account private key ..... just confirm me if i get your point correctly
you can collect it back if you close the account
i got it. thanks man.
do i have any method of getting a delegated token account in Solana Web3?
for solana accounts, it means the account goes sayonara and gets deleted. The SOL you see transferred to it on creation is the minimum rent necessary to keep the account forever without having to pay rent
and if so ... then why phantom wallet dont show such balance in it
wait, so the bump seed is just a byte that gets appended to the end of the seed "string"?
means we will not able to make txn to the account
rent ... what does 'it gets cleaned up' really mean ?
check out this snippet here - https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/87b74cfa4c399fae428bce1f08e95d97fa625b8a/feature-proposal/program/src/processor.rs#L73-L77

it helped me a lot with understanding how to get a valid seed to sign with that you can pass into `invoke_signed`
it's used to keep the account available as rent. If an account runs out of rent, it gets cleaned up
so create stops on the first try, and if it does work, you could pass a bump seed of 0 to invoke_signed?
because tried to do this in phantom wallet but it shows there insufficient balance even the getBalance rpc method shows that value as amount
basically `find_` is repeating until it finds a valid address, while `create_` is not guaranteed to give you a valid result
or its non sweepable amount ?
<@!137101040687382528> can we sweep that 0.0020488 amount which goes the account for which the associated address is being created if i have the access to users private key ?
mainly this part here:
> Note that the address generated using create_program_address is not guaranteed to be a valid program address off the curve. For example, let's assume that the seed "escrow2" does not generate a valid program address.
> 
> To generate a valid program address using "escrow2 as a seed, use find_program_address, iterating through possible bump seeds until a valid combination is found. The preceding example becomes:
Check https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#hash-based-generated-program-addresses if you haven't yet

> Program addresses are deterministically derived from a collection of seeds and a program id using a 256-bit pre-image resistant hash function. Program address must not lie on the ed25519 curve to ensure there is no associated private key. During generation an error will be returned if the address is found to lie on the curve. There is about a 50/50 chance of this happening for a given collection of seeds and program id. If this occurs a different set of seeds or a seed bump (additional 8 bit seed) can be used to find a valid program address off the curve.
and how do "I" (as the program) sign a transaction such that I can transfer tokens to someone else? invoke_signed, sure, but I'm doing that "for"... the PDA, right?
What's the difference between deriving and finding, though?
yeah I already understood parts of this
there is spltoken.createAccount to handle that - https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L446
a token account is just a ordinary solana account, but owned by the token program
you'd always `find` (derive) a valid program address that the program itself control 
once you have the address (and are able to sign for it) you can use it for whatever you want, including spl token stuff

Steps to create a spl token account would be the same as with a normal non-PDA, so createAccount with enough space for the mint, and set the owner of the account to spl_token program

new to Solana, not so new to Rust
How does one set up a program-controlled spl_token wallet? I think I understand the basic concept of a program-derived address, but I'm having trouble making sense of the difference between `Pubkey::create_with_seed`, `Pubkey::create_program_address`, and `Pubkey::find_program_address`, and then the whole thing where you need to then derive an address for the spl_token data is an added layer of confusion.
you'd have to connect the users wallet (phantom, solflare, etc) and use it to sign the transaction with `feePayer` and `fromPubkey` set to wallet that's supposed to pay (like for createaccount here - https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#CreateAccountParams)
just want to know the entire flow with technical details so that i can do this by myself
can you provide any example or any application that is currently using this method ?
you could make a dapp where the user has to click a button to receive the tokens, then you could charge him with the creation of the associated token account
nope not possible
is there any solution for to avoid such heavy fees for almost 1 million user
for single user it might now get into this , but with large user base this charges are too much to pay ..
after creating a associated address for a token , it deducts balance of 0.00204428 from the wallet from which the associated address is being create and this amount is transfer to the public address of the that account for which associated address is created
Hi all! I am new to Solana.

I would need help to add the validation on the Solana wallet on the frontend side. Need to check if the Solana wallet address is valid or not. Is there any script or code to check in Javascript?
What kind of validation I can place to check whether users are putting real wallets instead of junk data?

 e.g. for eth web3.utils.isAddress(User_address);
Are people able to see the source code of deployed solana contracts? I'm buidling a game and wondering if the game mechanics should be in a smart contract or just done off chain
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#AccountInfo
this is account info struct.
you can try to print owner. it should print system program.
its data is zero is expected because its data just empty.
if you want the SOL balance use https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getBalance

When getAccountInfo == null, it just means that there is no account at that specific key
what are you trying to retrieve? the SOL balance or token balance, or some other info in that account?
```const connection=new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com','confirmed')
const wallet=new PublicKey('AhDzThmxW4Y5q6DcQo53nEzcRjU5kZMxrC6c8jtzeUXz')
async function Test() {
    let data=await connection.getAccountInfo(wallet,'confirmed')
    console.log(data?.data)
}```
this is the simple snippet that i'm running
how did  you fetch it? could you share the code? or I think there is some mismatch in you're connection
the wallet does have 0.3 Sol in it...
Hey <@!213083996689661953>, question for you. When you review PRs for token-list, do you verify the metadata is legitimate (e.g. if someone claims to be part of a team)? Or could anyone put any metadata they want there
I guess your wallet address's balance is 0. chain don't remain account's data if account's balance is 0.
why does getAccountInfo return null when i enter a wallet address?
Is Bonfida Nameservice using the Solana nameservice program https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/name-service/program ?

Hi all, when trying to create a token with the commande line "spl-token create-token" the following error is returned "error: No such file or directory (os error 2)". Can someone please point me in the right direction to solve this? thanks
JUST FIGURED IT OUT: Instead of using `solana transfer --from prompt://` (for Paper Wallets), use `solana transfer --from ASK` to use the main account!
when the account data size is larger, the contract execution TPS is lower. Is it caused by account data copy-on --write?
Any ideas how to access that **root** address where I originally sent SOL to?
BTW: If I use solana-keygen pubkey ASK  with the original seed phrase + passphrase I used during the generation process, i DO get the same pubkey I originally got printed right after generation
TL;DR: I used a pubkey  as a wallet address (as explained in the docs) to transfer some SOL myself. Probably lost all of it. Any chance to recover it? Thanks in advance for your help!
üö® This is possibly a VERY DANGEROUS error in the docs. Probably many people like me have lost lots of SOL because of this.
Hi everyone! Quick question: just created a Paper wallet and used the pubkey that's returned with the solana  cli, as a wallet address, following literal instructions in docs (screenshot below). And minutes later stumbled upon the key derivation concept (https://forums.solana.com/t/paperwallet-addresses-bad-guide-in-solana-docs/3042). Now I'm fearing that I've lost those SOL I transferred!
Amazing, thank you for the help!
there are some articles about rent
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts#rent
https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/rent
this is for account's rent. transaction fee is another thing.
(or are they the same thing and I'm just missing the idea)
Is this  the account being charged rent or a transaction fee for processing the transfer?
there is a rpc https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getminimumbalanceforrentexemption
or if you have installed cli tool, you can use `solana rent --help`
<@!788215642070581289>  this was exactly it, thanks for pointing me in the right direction! Do you know any way off the top of your head to estimate what the fee will be so I can rewrite the test to account for the difference?
try to send a number bigger than 890880
your received account has been charged fee.
Anyone have any thoughts as to why an invoked `system_instruction::transfer`  instruction would only reflect a balance change for the sending account and not the receiving account? I'm wondering if I need to do something to confirm the transfer succeeded.

Rust:
```rust

invoke(
    &system_instruction::transfer(
        ctx.accounts.buyer.key,
        ctx.accounts.treasury.key,
        generator.config.price,
    ),
    &[
        ctx.accounts.buyer.to_account_info(),
        ctx.accounts.treasury.to_account_info(),
        ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info(),
    ],
)?;
```

JS:
```javascript
const signature = await program.rpc.transfer({ ... });
await provider.connection.confirmTransaction(signature);

const data = await program.account.generator.fetch(generator.publicKey);
const treasuryBalance = await provider.connection.getBalance(treasury.publicKey);
const recipientBalance = await provider.connection.getBalance(recipient.publicKey);

expect(recipientBalance).to.equal(anchor.web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL - 10); // succeeds
expect(treasuryBalance).to.equal(10); // Throws 0 != 10

Hey I‚Äôm just getting into working with Solana and have just been playing around in the devnet. I‚Äôve been trying to make my own token with spl-token create-token

Hi guys ! I need with solana/web3.js to send NFT token and get his informations (like his name). How can I do that ? Thanls !
`process didn't exit successfully` is a bit vague.
How do you actually see the error messages with cargo?
I just get
```
error: could not compile `libsecp256k1`
Caused by: process didn't exit successfully: `rustc --crate-name libsecp256k1 --edition=2018 <big list of files/options/etc>

I did get it building once, and the tests mostly ran, but then failed. It just seems super-flaky. I don't know if it's cargo/rust or what (I'm new to rust so not really sure what's going on)
I've tried various environments, Dockerfile based on rust:1.56.0, ubuntu, Pop os... cargo build always fails

Hey guys, is there anyway of seeing new token listings on solana? 
Something like this:

https://www.dextools.io/app/fantom/pool-explorer
ok so seems the ways to respond to on chain things is directly from the RPC API  and w/ its websocket subscriptions, right?
Ok one question about this line on the field `mentions`: 
```
mentions - subscribe to all transactions that mention the provided Pubkey (as base-58 encoded string)
```
Is the pub key already encoded into the log message for us? Is that something that needs to be added?
nvm, found this, so i think im ok. https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#logssubscribe
üëã  Hey all, I'm trying to get more info on how to respond to certain actions from on chain actions. I understand transactions are quick with SOL and one can just wait for the call to return. But im wondering if SOL has the concept of events? I've seen docs on logs using `msg!`, are those searchable?
Oh... building with `./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh .` rather than just `cargo build` - I'm not sure what the difference is; the first is what the build-from-source docs say to do, whereas the second is what the GH README file says to do.
Trying to build I get
```Compiling libsecp256k1 v0.6.0
error: could not compile `libsecp256k1`
```
But it's not really clear what the error is. Does cargo hide logs somewhere?

struct GreetingAccount, as noted above is using derive(Borsh..,..) for serialization.  When try_from_slice is called from the type GreetingAccount::,  it is trying to deserialize this instance from the data. If succeeds you now have the deserialized greeting_account object which was declared as 'mutable', that you can now modify, and when done modifying, you can re-serialize, saving the data.  The object was specified to use Borsh to serialize (derive(Borsh..)  .serialize.  The object:: was used to specify borsh (try_from_slice to deserialize into this instance.

SafeTransferFrom is a fn in SafeERC20
Hey guys, I am trying to decompile code for Magic Eden, so that I can send off transactions directly on the blockchain. I am looking for a way to learn how to decompile their code in an efficient manner or find someone who can help with that (I would pay them). Any pointers as to where that information could be is greatly appreciated.
want to transfer tokens in rust
Under `Reclaiming program data accounts`
Once you close a program account, it is effectively disabled forever at that address. Check out the section on close program accounts here https://jstarry.notion.site/Program-deploys-29780c48794c47308d5f138074dd9838#561f8e76208a46b8963092adabab2256 It'll go through a bunch of info
What happens to the account that are owned by a program when we close a program account? Are those accounts closed as well? And also can i redeploy to the same address after closing a program account for a particular address

Hey, need help in implementing this.

Is there something similar to `safeTranferFrom` in rust?
Bonfida is trying to create something permissionless as well. My understanding is the current system was never supposed to be long term
Suggestion =/= punishment.
I'm gonna guess it was a joke either way
Oh right, so.. lets keep the collective punishment up?
It's a permissionless protocol. You're welcome to create a better system on chain
This is clearly something that is bugging you along with anyone else responsible for keeping this discord clean, by the looks of how you along with your fellow colleagues are responding to anyone asking this question.

I dont know if the message im quoting is serious or not, but "punishing" anyone for not obeying to your ineffective/flawed (at best) system is probably not the way to solve this issue.

any workaround : (
You could build something like CORS though
You can do some whitelisting of public keys, but there's nothing that interacts with the internet on programs
You can use `accountSubscribe` to listen to account changes and perform your work https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#accountsubscribe
is there any way to allow calling of a solana program only from a specific domain? something like CORS?

I also think that is the only way to get token object after `createMint`.
<@!907871919771090954> you can also find a few examples in the tests folder https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/test/token.test.js
Is iancoleman.io a legitimate source to help retrieve lost coins?
You can read to the definition of the Token class here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/02d273679792c78c4b73f24d9709a9ad99e16d77/token/js/client/token.js#L286

As you can see you can initialize a new token instance by giving the expected parameters to the constructor.
Hello!
We develop a cross-chain solution consisting of two layers:
- Protocol layer - smart contracts in each blockchain of the cross-chain.
- Infrastructure layer - off-chain inspection nodes.

Part of the infrastructure layer is a self-written scanner based on block parsing.

It is needed to catch the events generated by the contract, process and call the necessary contract functions in another network.

A general description of the scanner's operation using the example of ether-like networks: we connect to an RPC provider and parse each block for the existence of a contract event.

That is, we ask the scanner to search for a specific event at the address of the contract, which it (the scanner) will look for in each block. When a specific event is found, the corresponding handler is launched. 

We are looking for a solution for Solana scanning.

Is there already something similar in Solana? Maybe someone is ready to help us with this task?
Thanks your answer.
But what I want to do is 
```rust
const token = await Token.createMint(...);
const sameToken = await Token.findToken(token.publicKey);
```
Is there a function to search token from token pubkey?
hehe, please ignore `programSubscribe` does that.
I am using that but probably there is a bug somewhere else in the code.
yes
free  ones
any quicknode alternatives?
By program account you mean PDA?
<@!907871919771090954> 
`const token = await Token.createMint(...)` ?
Following code is belong to `@solana/spl-token/Token`

      mintAuthority: PublicKey,
      freezeAuthority: PublicKey | null,
      decimals: number,
      programId: PublicKey,
    ): Promise<Token>;
```

Is there a way to get Token's object back through pubkey that I got through this function?
Hey, Is their any subscriptions on RPC  to get notification whenever there is a change in any program account or a new program account is created?
hi, another question: is there a definitive list of reasons of why a transaction that has been successfully simulated could fail? Are there ways to create such a transaction intentionally?
Phantom throws a different error when the user rejected
No, unfortunately not. It happens before the approval popup exists
Means the user rejected the signature request
So i was trying to use the example on the github ```js

import { WalletNotConnectedError } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-base';
import { useConnection, useWallet } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react';
import { Keypair, PublicKey, SystemProgram, Transaction } from '@solana/web3.js';

import React, { FC, useCallback } from 'react';
import Wallet from './Wallet'


export default function Send() {

    const { connection } = useConnection();
    const { publicKey, sendTransaction } = useWallet();
    const wallet = useAnchorWallet();

    

    const onClick = useCallback(async () => {
        if (!publicKey) throw new WalletNotConnectedError();

        const transaction = new Transaction().add(
            SystemProgram.transfer({
                fromPubkey: publicKey,
                toPubkey: Keypair.generate().publicKey,
                lamports: 1,
            })
        );

        const signature = await sendTransaction(transaction, connection);

       await connection.confirmTransaction(signature, 'processed');
    }, [publicKey, sendTransaction, connection]);


    return (
        <div>
        <Wallet/>
        <button onClick={onClick} disabled={!publicKey}>
            Send 1 lamport to a random address!
        </button>
        </div>
    )
}

//NOTE:  'Wallet' is the basic set up for the connect pop up. 

``` But the problem is is that even after connecting my wallet it still doesn't register a 'publicKey'. (This may be a bit of a nooby questions but i just started working with js/react.js so i don't know how all things work)

AFAIK there are two different kinds of node in solana, vote and not vote.
if you just need to use rpc, you can build a non-vote validator.
if you want to stake SOL or producing block you need to build a vote validator.
no. in contract you have to pass all accounts you need and use borrow to get its data.

                pdas_temp_token_account.clone(),
                takers_token_to_receive_account.clone(), // why receive_account signing is needed?

Because it is just receive account.

honestly, we've been thinking about deprecating that multisig usage and recommending the serum one, but it hasn't been audited yet
ah yeah, the token program multisig is a whole other beast.  essentially it just gets all of the signers at once, as opposed to other multisigs which can collect signatures one by one before making the transaction
ok, in this example https://spl.solana.com/token#multisig-usage,  here --signer flag seems like collect signatures for mint instruction, after read the source code, i dont really understand what it used for, can you help explain it more about it?

Following code transfer SOL from source account to destination one.

**source_info.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? -= 5;
// Deposit five lamports into the destination
**destination_info.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? += 5;

How can we be sure that the total amount of  SOL sent is the same as the total amount of SOL received?

is it possible to import directly SPL-token program account into my program like i import Sysvars? i do not want to pass is from the UI all the time.
hi guys
What are people's thoughts on implementing/extending a custom CurveCalculator for spl_token_swap... Would you:

a. clone the spl token-swap repository and implement a custom curve under program/src/curve
b. start with a more bare-bones boilerplate program and import/use from spl_token_swap::*
c. do it with some other abstraction/IDL like Anchor?

Would be interested to hear about people's experiences with these approaches ... Any other approach I should consider?
How do i query the nfts in a wallet through my json mint list, thanks im looking through the solana program library and just need to know what to look at.
how can i invoke singed transactions in solana/web3.js?

I want to use @solana/web3.js to transfer lamports without having the private key in signer, and instead want phantom to approve the transaction
```

```

2. Is receipe in link (https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/16942#issuecomment-830187286) is good idea? Or I could store only keypair (not seed phrase), e.g. and make derived address from it?

3. is any option to get seed phrase from keypair?   (generated by solana-keygen)

Thanks!!!
hi, Could anyone explain how to work with seed-phrase

My task is to create several account with one private key. I found workaround here:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/16942#issuecomment-830187286
Store seed pharse & create derivate pubkeys.


questions
1) as I see, there is no ASK option in solana-keygen. Is it not supported now? But I can't reprodue ASK path with full-path:

maybe `solana-install init 1.8.2`
sorry for mistype `solana-keygen recover -o output.json`
i think that for creating a new wallet
it says Error: "Unknown release: 1.7.16"
I tried solana-install update
How do I upgrade my solana
My solana clustor is 1.8.2
I installed solana --version 1.7.16
So that is the only valid source of getting it to work?
maybe solana-keygen new -o output.json 
then you can cat output.json and copy the array
thanks <@!788215642070581289> but this is original msg that I got: "Save this seed phrase and your BIP39 passphrase to recover your new keypair" so i have the seed phrase and the bip39 passphrase, my question is how i combine those two to get a private key to use it to import the wallet in phantom
i tried creating my own spl token and mint it and its works fine, thought to test with existing tokens
yes mate
a place to get some token. I think you want to get some token which in token list.
I suggest you can just create your own token so that you can mint it by yourself
private key is the raw source.
FYI there is a source maybe help https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/tour/create-keypair.html
faucet means?
thanks, what about if i used a BIP39 Passphrase? how can i import that in phantom?
it is fine to use dev cluster to develop or you can build from source so that you can use `solana-test-validator`
Not sure is there any token on token list has faucet, but I'll say just create your own token to test is the best.
https://spl.solana.com/token
https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/tour/create-mint.html
you can import cli tool's private key to phantom wallet
or you create a new phantom wallet and use `solana-keygen recover 'prompt:?key=0/0' -o phantom.json` to recover it by phantom seeds.

Thank you <@!785084693023424542> üëç
cheers mate! yeah have written it in bash already, but thought might be more effecient/streamline to write in web3, thoughts?
how you coded it is either missing signatures or not correctly adding them or using the keypair. be careful with airdrops esepcailly on public RPC/Network as youll likely get rate limited or banned with repeated use or abuse.
this may be a reference to look at and learn from? not tested or used. https://github.com/h4rkl/Ghetto-SolAir

Wow! Thanks for the thorough responses. I‚Äôve learned a little about rust and the llvm compiler and have some more googling to do for solidity

hi can anyone lead me in the correct direction for writing an airdrop script that takes in token-mint-address and personal keypair using web3? cheers
for Ethereum, solidity was created to be a simpler to develop in language for smart contracts that could produce evm (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible code, grabbing familiar syntax and construction from other popular languages. Rust is used in Solana as it is the native language of what was chosen to build Solana, also viewed as a more secure, memory efficient, performant and package friendlier version of a C/C++ like language. You can technically also code program in C/C++. That and the effort to be compatible would be a large effort, which is currently being undertaken on several fronts from various contributors. It is also flexible as mentioned so that in the future any LLVM compatible or transpiled to LLVM compatible, could technically be used to create smart contracts/programs, as mentioned above.
hi could someone explain account rent for bonafida?

What is the clearance period of fund in a phantom wallet?
thanks
Noob question that maybe has been asked before, but I‚Äôm a Ruby on Rails developer (and lots of JavaScript exp) but I know practically nothing about blockchain dev. Why was solidity made and why does Solana use Rust instead?

I'm trying to use a cross-program invocation in C, and I'm noticing that `sol_invoke_signed` requires a SolInstruction and SolAccountInfos. However, SolInstruction itself already contains SolAccountMetas. isn't that redundant? or do they serve different purposes?
Thanks! I'll check it out. Found that there are 3 solana go SDKs on Github, this one seems to be the one with best docs
maybe https://github.com/step-finance/step-staking
maybe try this one https://yihau.gitbook.io/solana-go

Is there a resource on implementing staking for your spl token ?
Golang for Solana Development?

Hi there,

I‚Äôm still newbie in the blockchain ecosystem. I have played around with Solidity and all good but due to high gas fees I got curious about Solana and I‚Äôm enjoying it so far.

However, currently in my day job I have to learn Golang for some project that is popping up for next year. I was messing around with Rust(newbie to Rust as well) but my web2 job still pay the bills. So I thought if there‚Äôs a way to develop for Solana using Golang instead of Rust.

There‚Äôs this ‚Äúsolana-go‚Äù SDK that is currently in development (very little documentation) on GitHub but would like to know if there‚Äôs more tooling, resources, about Solana Development in Go.

That way I could focus on getting good with Go in my day job and in my spare time. I could bootstrap my learning process way faster that splitting myself between Rust and Go.

Would appreciate any thoughts on this, resources, and guidance. Thanks!
Hello dev friends!

I've explored the official developer resources and also looked at some open source tools & libraries. I'd like to find some specific guidance on how to do simple minting related tasks on the backend, such as build some scripts to mint a set of simple NFTs as a batch job. I'm open to using any language/toolset.

So far, I'm banging my head against incomplete/wrong tutorials, outdated docs, immature/buggy libraries.

Anyone have any advice on where to look for up-to-date tutorials & libs for end-to-end backend development and minting? Any and all pointers would be greatly appreciated! üòé
<@!137101040687382528> it all seems to work üéâ thanks for the help last night, just gotta finish implementing my other opcodes now
Anyone have advice on decoding account data on chain? I've figured it out through js.
whether it is listed actively on a secondary marketplace
not really clear on what command is not recognized. if cargo is recognized.
with the other stuff
i ran cargo install
yes and yes cargo is recognised. i ran the command but still the same error
as far as tools that can access a lot of data I am not sure.  I dont recall the exact data that solana.fm, graph, aleph, and some other providers may have access to. probably an archive node to query data using a client of some sort, web3, json, or cli would work. some of the rpc providers store a lot of older or 'archive' data. rpcpool, quicknodes, or one of the other nodes should have that. more information on trying to get this data yourself may be here: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-bigtable
Hi guys, what is the best tool to fetching archive transactions in order to analysis data, prepare some statistics from DeFi protocol?
and do rustup, and make sure cargo is installed?  usually it may say something like command 'x' not found.   if u just type cargo and enter is cargo recognized?
did you do a standard install following this? `https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools` ?
hmmm
cargo install spl-token-cli
is there any client code for this on-chain program example ? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/examples/rust/transfer-lamports/src/processor.rs
what command?
says command not found?
and you ran this right?  `cargo install spl-token-cli`
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com 
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: solana-keypair.json 
Commitment: confirmed
not sure what you mean by listing status?
did you print your exact endpoint connection?  from `solana config get` ?
Anyone know how to fetch the data from solana web 3 about listing status?
thanks
Mostly about where I live
I‚Äôm in the uk. Solana ping works and it says a lot of stuff when I run that command.
Thank you so much
Assuming the random number is possible, how would the other part work though?
just updated above with more instructions.
How about the private key? Can I fetch that in an easy way?
There's an easy command to fetch the public key from the keypair
Go ahead and post them here
No. Let me follow the instructions. üôÇ
I don't think true randomness currently exists today. You'd need something like VRF, which is not available to Solana yet
Can I ask someone some basic questions regarding the keypair generated with the Solana CLI?
Like if I had a contract that paid out a random user (like a lottery application), how would that work?
How would something like BetDEX (https://www.betdex.com) work if the programs can't determine winners?
did you generate a keypair yet? if not youll want to generate a keypair and if needed for certain transactions may need to fund it.  id try if you can practicing a little on a local validator, or with devnet, or testnet if needed before working on main.   you can repoint your default config with `solana config set --url devnet`  for example.  and in dev fund your keypair with `solana airdrop 5`, follow some spl docs to get used to it: https://spl.solana.com/token 
https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/cli  but basically `solana-keygen new`
default keypair file output to: `~/.config/solana/id.json `  then type `solana address` should show your new public key address, and you can start using cli with keypair.
anyone able to explain how a merged pull request would not be showing up in the json file now when several before and after mine appear to to have been merged successfully and now appear in the main repository?
You need to provide all accounts that a transaction will interact with before sending the transaction. You key/value stores, check out how mapping works for accounts in this guide https://solana.wiki/docs/solidity-guide/accounts/
Thank you so much. I'm getting "error: unrecognized signer source"
And is there anyway to have key/value stores on a program?
Are you able to make transactions without knowing which addresses will be debited or paid?
you dont want to include brackets, if you are. but that will just drop a bunch of balances if the token mint address is valid, possibly. and you may want to run with -v to print more info. though im not sure the command here would print everything you need from cli. you may need to do something else to get all the info. but u can see.
<@!785084693023424542> Thank you for the setup guide. I think I'm installed now.
<@!489206164270350337> in that thread you linked me to it explicitly says "from solana, you can only use solana-program on-chain", which makes sense in the context of the errors I'm seeing. Appreciate the help!
When I try spl-token accounts <MINT_ADDRESS>   (dropping the token address in the brackets),  I'm getting "the syntax of the command is incorrect".
Hello, new here, I just finished deploying an example program(transfer-lamports) on devnet... I needed some help communicating with deployed app,     Is there a way to manually do a RPC JSON transaction to the deployed program ?
Here's an example of sending a spl-token on chain with js https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/examples/create_mint_and_transfer_tokens.js
Check out https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/872219340555034655/872229911950143508
Looks like other people have had your issue before, and found that sys wasn't supported on chain. The sdk for solana should be though
web3.SystemProgram.transfer({
      fromPubkey: from.publicKey,
      toPubkey: to.publicKey,
      lamports: web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL / 100,
    }),

if i wanted to send a nft token instead of lamports, how would I edit this transfer?
but it wasn't that anyway so whatever
yeah that's what I was thinking
50K for just that seems excessive
note to self: that happens
ok yeah
or maybe my method of cutting out that usage is just getting optimized out as UB >_>
looks like almost 50k is on getting accounts with an iterator, gonna try getting that down
rent is almost 2 SOL... hmm
yes
oh, that's a reasonable size?
Ok, sounds like the program is not that complex... I have a sample app with 9 instructions that's 130K
spl-token accounts <MINT_ADDRESS> i think
ballpark of 128k
yes, somewhat.  id recommend installing WSL (windows for linux) if your on windows, and following the install instructions, and get the Solana CLI up and running: https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools
How big is the `*.so` file? It is usually a function of the amount of code you have in the source
<@!489206164270350337> how confident are you in this? I dug in a bit more and it seems like the `unresolved import 'crate::sys'` is the first major flag. I'm not sure the sys package is available on chain?
how do i stop solana ping ü§£
yes
From what directory are you deploying? `target\deploy` ? Or?
Friends, I want to send an airdrop of "token A" to all accounts holding "token B". Is there a way to pull a list of all wallet addresses holding a particular token?
not sure I understand the question - I'm doing everything locally with a test validator at the moment
im in the uk
Where are you deploying from?
yeh solana ping works. ill run that command now
can you `solana ping` ?   what region are you in?   
I dont see any other reports about invaid certs atm. 
what do you see when you run :
` openssl s_client -showcerts -connect api.devnet.solana.com:443`
Is there any tooling for figuring out what's contributing to an on-chain program's size?
So you would just call the upload instruction within metaplex at the end
Not necessarily. You could mint as an NFT using metaplex, which I believe already has an upload function
No. I have code in JavaScript it‚Äôs of a generator where someone can upload a picture and Toss on a filter and put captions on it like a meme ‚Ä¶ what I want to do is integrate a smart contract function  to mint when user is done.. does this mean I have to rewrite this code in rust ?
You need some prexisting way to swap the tokens. I believe this is done on solanart, magic eden, digital eyes and more for nfts
<@!489206164270350337>I think thats a little more in depth than I need. All i need is to create a one time transaction that one acount is basically "buying" buying the nft from the other account
Thank you, as always
You'll have to create the swap on the program to swap the tokens
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token-swap
Yes
Sounds like you're trying to do a token swap?
The sdk can be used, yes
So you have program code in rust, and want to call the instructions from javascript? Check out the solana-program-library. token, token-swap, token-lending all have rust/js bindings that you can reference https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library
Good idea, I'll post there too. Also want to confirm that the `solana-sdk` can be used for on-chain programs? I was able to complile a CLI tool with the sdk as a dependency without a problem
https://discord.gg/Dxp5qcYm
Since you created it with anchor, check if anyone has run into this in the anchor discord. Although, it seems like a general rust issue unrelated
can anyone point me to resources that will allow me to create a transaction in javascript? This transaction will: send nft from the connected wallet to a different wallet and the wallet that receives this nft will automatically send SOL to the wallet the NFT was received from
I got a question ? 

Let‚Äôs see I have existing non smart contract code like some stuff put together with Java script ‚Ä¶ how do I integrate a smart contract function into this existing framework
Anyone have thoughts around why adding the `solana-sdk` to my Cargo.toml would result in a build failure? Here's a gist of the build log and relevant Cargo file: https://gist.github.com/theycallmeswift/e095e2e5510c749df10dbbcb98184267
i can airdrop yes.
ok i tried again with new wallet, new everything... i even reset console and uninstalled rust. same error... i tried 'sol-token create-token -v' same error.no more info
That may be true. Definitely put an issue and see if it can be resolved quickly
Check with gate.io
I do not have a guide, but you can follow the tests. Aurory did this
I mean, maybe it isn't up-to-date
Oh, I know: for whichever reason, the stake pool program has an internal copy of the stake program (instead of pulling it as a dependency). That may be why.
Tried to transfer my samo to trust wallet from gate.io, being a noob I sent it to sol. Looks like it's sat in explorer.solana.com but have no idea how to retrieve it, please advise
Thank you very much. Do you possibly know a guide to set this up? If not don‚Äôt worry Ill have a go trying to do it myself! Thank you!
If you're looking for some sort of staking solution for spl tokens, Step open sourced their version https://github.com/step-finance/reward-pool
stake-pool using the stake program, which is only for SOL
thanks for the speedy help üôÇ
yes
That is odd. I know it is a relatively new program. Maybe make an issue on the git? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library
Oh! So it's a limit on the number of connections opened within a time period?
Would this work for an spl token or just SOL? Thanks
the `stake-pool` program source code is in the solana program library github, and the current spl docs for it are listed here: https://spl.solana.com/stake-pool
Thanks. I'm starting from scratch as far as a dev environment. I'm on PC/Windows. Is there a guide somewhere that will help me set up so I can run this? https://spl.solana.com/token#finding-all-token-accounts-for-a-specific-mint
Why is it `i64`, and not `u64` ?
Seems like the same thing, just at one time vs over 10s
`Maximum concurrent connections per IP: 40
Maximum connection rate per 10 seconds per IP: 40`

It's a different thing.
I think I found the error ; I‚Äôm redoing it soon so I‚Äôll update you. I did airdrop it with sol and added actual sol on the main net. I‚Äôll update you! Thanks for the help üôå. Also do you happen to know a guide showing you how to add a staking function where you can lock up tokens? So like people lock my token up for a certain time and receive variable rewards?
not to my knowledge, but there are a lot of new sites popping up.
it is that `sysvar\:\:clock::Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp` ?
this sounds like the same error..  have you tried a local validator?  can you perform an `solana aridrop 1` or any other calls? it may not be related to solana specifically, but with your machine config or setup. network, tls, ssl, or proxy related?  is there more to the error? and if you run with `-v` do you get more info or extended error info?
i guess, it's the only way no ?
with Clock ?
Hi, how can i get the current timestamp since std::time is off ?
Pyth is an interesting project for sure, but I think they still have a bit to work out on their back end before I'd consider them reliable (e.g. there have been several flash crashes that I don't feel were adequately explained). Personally I'd use chainlink: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/22/bitcoin-flash-crashes-to-5k-on-pyth-networks-data-feed/
I am not a developer and don't have a dev environment setup on my PC, otherwise I would dig in and try to figure it out. Are there any web apps/GUIs that will pull all holder wallets of a particular token? I've been looking around but can't find anything.
From my program, yes. That's why it's weird that it fails because the instruction does not exist.
Ah I see. I recall unions from C. Didn't realize that that's what Rust enums were. Interesting
That looks like the stake pool calling token and stake programs, failing at stake program. You were just calling `WithdrawStake` on the stake pool?
You can have multiple concurrent connections hitting the RPC
That means you didn't have the funds. It may depends on what transaction you're doing, what the payer is
I don't believe every nodes retain access to every transaction. Most don't. You can listen for account changes with `accountSubscribe` https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#accountsubscribe
But I'm not the one calling the instruction, it's the token program:
```
    Program SPoo1Ku8WFXoNDMHPsrGSTSG1Y47rzgn41SLUNakuHy invoke [2]
    Program log: Instruction: WithdrawStake
    Program TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA invoke [3]
    Program log: Instruction: Burn
    Program TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA consumed 2766 of 148050 compute units
    Program TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA success
    Program Stake11111111111111111111111111111111111111 invoke [3]
    Program Stake11111111111111111111111111111111111111 failed: incorrect program id for instruction
```
How can the token program call an instruction that does not exist?
I believe that means you're trying to execute an instruction that doesn't not exist on the program
https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints
What does "connection rate" mean exactly in the document?
Hello,
Why my anchor test fail for "Error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Attempt to debit an account but found no record of a prior credit." but my local wallet have SOL ?

Hi all!

Does anyone know how full nodes work in Solana?
- Does every node retain access to every single transaction?
- Is there an easy way to listen for changes on a specific account? for example, if I wanted to monitor a Solana account, that is an Orca pool, for any change in the metadata, could I do that via some smart RPC method, or do I need to poll?
Hello, after running a program, I get:
```
Program Stake11111111111111111111111111111111111111 invoke [3]
Program Stake11111111111111111111111111111111111111 failed: incorrect program id for instruction
```
It's the first time I get this message, what does it mean?
I done the transfer of 20 sol
can someone help me with minting a new token? i keep getting the error '‚Äòerror sending request for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com/): error trying to connect : invalid certificate : UnknownIssuer.'
that address could be a 'wallet' account, which are generally owned by system program 111111...  without the key/sign owner, or knowledge of this account, the owner/signer would be the only one who can transfer the SOL out of this account, afaik.
so 20 sol was transferred to this address, is this your account, did you do this transfer?   to: GCaZ99MC7arj3HJYdexvEWsAHo25hvV7jGbwM6ktc6y
GCaZ99MC7arj3HJYdexvEWsAHo25hvV7jGbwM6ktc6y
I think I sent you the wrong thing. They were my transactions
there is a transaction on main network, says it was transferred to account: `BENdQDyDsjV89PttU3FuCFQFzvs6JFoT4jJvcVEBk6Bd`, and that account currently has 0 sol.so the transfer was to an account, perhaps a stake account, and the last 2 transfers from that account have removed the entire balance. so those funds have already been moved.
I‚Äôm not sure. Sorry
Hello guys.
I have a question about token transfer.

I use following code for transfer.
```ts
 const transferTokenToTempTokenAccountIx = Token.createTransferInstruction(
    TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
    userTokenAccountPubkey,
    tempTokenAccountKeypair.publicKey,
    userWallet.publicKey,
    [],
    amountOfTokenWantToSale
  );
```

And I get ` Program log: Error: insufficient funds` error.
But I don't think my SOL balance not enough to transfer.

- solana balance
- 499999999.975941479 SOL

Do guys know how to solve this problem?
main, dev, test?

Hey, how to calculate staking APY for validators? The docs are too high level and do not tell the specifics https://docs.solana.com/inflation/terminology such as number of validators, number of epochs, slot times, ...
Question, is there a Rest API that I can interact with via json? 

My goal is to write a little front-end app that can interact with solana.

Interacting with this api, can I also log into other platform accounts like PhantomWallet, and SolWallet respectfully in the same API?

(Pardon, if I miss understand something, this is my first time interacting with bitcoin software)

Thanks!
Whats the minimum amount of SOL needed to store in the Nonce account? I saw `minimum balance required: 0.00136416 SOL` in the docs but is it a const number?
hello, help please, any method to get transactions by wallet address? i tried to find it at docs, but don't found üò¶
getting this when trying to develop on localnet, anyone know what could be the reason?
are you minting the reward token from the program? or accessing some supply of reward tokens?  in either case if your program has the authority, and or account authority of the token account, the program can transfer to the known 'token' wallet address (assuming it was passed in).  ull want to make sure the user has the 'reward' token account.
Adding my u8 (wich mess up the alignment) at the end of the struct didn't solved it (on rust)
Got it! Thanks
Check this out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7351654/why-does-sizeof-give-wrong-measurement
I may be wrong, but I don't think that it how it works. You can see here that it references `bank` to get the. accounts, instead of getting the mapping from yet another account https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/rpc/src/rpc.rs#L377. Since all this information lives in the accountsdb, it can be pulled on the rpc that way
Hi, is there a way to get mem::size_of() but not aligned ?, like if i have a struct with 5 bool for example it will give me 8 as size, writing it hardcoded is ugly, or should i ?
Got it. That totally makes sense. Do you know which account specifically the program accounts mapping lives on? My understanding is that programs are stateless, so that information lives in a non executable account somewhere. Or how it is for example that a custom deployed program would know that it owns X accounts. Does that happen automatically or do you have to store the mapping yourself?
If the second signer is sending the transaction, they could use recent blockhash. You could also make the second signer the payer in the transaction
if second sends the tx
would that be easier maybe to pass recent blockhash from second signer to the first one?
Yes, mulitple nonce accounts is the way
oh
First to execute succeeds, the rest fail
need a different nonce account for each tx?
whats gonna happen if many tx execute in parallel?
Yes.  They're only good once
gotya thanks
because advance means change
Assuming you need that feature,  yes
Otherwise runtime just checks for the recent_blockhash in the the recent_blockhash_queue and fails to find it
oh so every time i do a tx i need to advance (update) a nonce?
The `AdvanceNonce` instruction is what tags a transaction as "using" the durable nonce feature
yes exactly. this instruction advances the nonce https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/offline-nonce-account/offlineNonceAccount.js#L74
For anybody (team devs also) who wants to chat on reddit about a Solana functionality I don't like a lot:

https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/qwsb0x/solana_trustless_risks/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Would really help me and the ecosystem to find a solution for this
If you're doing transactions with nonce accounts, you have to provide the `nonceInfo` instead of the blockhash. Check out this full example https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/offline-nonce-account/offlineNonceAccount.js#L81
i tried to specify it as a blockhash without advance instruction and got "Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found"
docs say: "While not typically needed outside a more useful transaction, the stored nonce value can be advanced by"
The provided example suggests to advance a nonce every time you use it, but why? https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/advanced/durable-nonce/use-nonce.html
ty
yes üôÇ
Is it more clear than before?

I need some help with solana py if anyone has experience with it please DM me. I'll be more than happy to pay for your time.
I could be wrong, but my understanding is that it is stored on the validators on the accountsdb. If you had access to a validator, you could use this https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/accountsdb-plugin-postgres to pull the account <-> program data yourself in postgres.
Well, i tried to unpack an account data that is too big for the stack, but the weird thing is that i was testing where the issue came from my code by putting msg!(), and my last msg! to popup wasn't where the issue was.
So i returned an error in my funtion lower and lower until i get the violate error and not my return error to get the exact line.
The getProgramAccounts rpc call gets all the accounts owned by that program. But my question is, where is that data stored? i.e. where is the mapping of program id -> account owned stored
Out of curiosity, what was the issue? May be helpful for others running into the same issue
Thank you, i figured out what was the problem
I don't believe spaces are allowed. That's not adhering to the spec. Something like GM-Solana would work I believe
Yes, please fix it. The automerge got updated
I just think it would be useful for others to know exactly what this does when first reading the top of the README. I don't think it's immediately clear
I'll give you a detailed flow and result screenshot üôÇ
would you mind adding a better description of what your program does in the README, so i can share it
Looks like you may have an issue with either a stale pointer for some memory issue. This is a generic Rust error, check out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35262927/access-violation-execution-of-address on some tips on how to debug it
Great information and I appreciate the quick reply!
Also, being on the ecosystem page does not guarantee a project is not a scam. There are probably better ways to determine this.
It used to be faster, but with so many projects it has slowed down
Most of the team has been in Lisbon for 2 weeks, and there is a backlog. We're working on ways to make this better but there is an absorbent amount of projects submitting and we have to review them. There's not much more I can tell you other than that
Awesome, thanks for open sourcing it

Hey, quick question. Any idea how long most have been waiting or some time frame for a long wait? Want to invest Ina  project that says they're in the queue but not sure if it's a scam or there's a legitimate- months long wait. Tha ks for any info you have!
What instruction are you hitting?
you're not the only one waiting for the ecosystem page, so you'll have to stay patient. don't tag random engineers in developer support for this
please stop tagging everyone
Does anyone know how long it takes to get listed on the solana ecosystem page once an application is sent?  a project keeps saying it is "in the queue" and im starting to think its a scam.
pls help
Hello I need help with github solana ecosystem page
And i don't allocate big numbers in the stack at all
Hi,
I'm having a weird issue and i can't figure it out what's the problem.
For this example, im calling `InitProject`, the unpack work well (i checked the value). But i'm geting an `Access violation in stack frame 1 at address 0x200001a28 of size 8 by instruction #260`
```rust
let instruction = ProjectInscrution::unpack(instruction_data)?;
match instruction {
    ProjectInscrution::InitProject => {
        Self::init(program_id, accounts)
    },
    ProjectInscrution::FillAccounts { bar , foo } => {
        Self::fill_accounts(program_id, accounts, bar, foo)
    },
    ProjectInscrution::Execute { bar } => {
        Self::execute(program_id, accounts, bar)
    },
    ...
    _ => {
        return Err(ProjectError::InvalidInstruction.into());
    }
}
```
The weird thing is when i remove all other match elements and leave it like this:
```rust
let instruction = ProjectInscrution::unpack(instruction_data)?;
match instruction {
    ProjectInscrution::InitProject => {
        Self::init(program_id, accounts)
    }
    _ => {
        return Err(ProjectError::InvalidInstruction.into());
    }
}
```
It work fine with the exactly same SC call.

Hi everyone.

I've been running my local Solana test net for a few months now. Everything was going well until recently, when I started to have some issues with transactions.

I run Solana 1.7.9 in docker container. Inside the container whenever I run, say `solana airdrop`, I get
```
Error: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds
```
The same response I get for most of my other transactions.
Hey just figured it out it was a permissions issue thanks!
Is this the issue: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/18848
ping me in PM, will try to help
I have it still isn't working
Any updates on `asm!()`, or does Solana not support handwritten assembly?
You can do that by copying the source, getting a new Program ID for it and deploying it. 
HOWEVER: If you modify it there is not certainty that the other SPL programs can interoperate with it. If you keep the same behavior and Data structures you may be ok but you'll need to do some serious testing
Have you added it to `.zshrc`?
I am looking for any examples on extending the standard spl-token implementation, for adding new functions to it
hello üëã
Can anyone help me with this?
Okk üëç
You should read the Solana Token Program

https://spl.solana.com/token
Okk... Thanks

But in case you know any smart contract which does so?
If you want to airdrop a token, you can create a script and run it on your CLI. This is my script to airdrop slp tokens: 

```#!/bin/bash

airdrop_accounts=(
"5MV.... WALLET TO AIRDROP"
"5Mv... WALLET TO AIRDROP"
)

nft_mint_accounts=(
"2vf... MY TOKEN ADDRESS"
)

LEN=1 

for i in $(seq 0 $LEN); 
do
     spl-token transfer ${nft_mint_accounts} 11706 ${airdrop_accounts[i]} --fund-recipient --allow-unfunded-recipient
done
```
You can access the Solana airdrop source from the solana-labs/solana git hub repo
I haven't. Can you please suggest any open source airdrop sc for solana? Thanks
https://spl.solana.com/
If you mean source code, you can't. The code for a Program is in BPF. If you really wanted you could 'disassemble' the BPF using LLVM or similar tools, but that just leaves you with BPF assembler source.
If you know the program have you checked to see if it is open source?
Hey Guys, is there any help/guide site where i can see different Rust implementation like sending SPLTokens or airdrop NFTs?
Does it fail if you request to airdrop 1 SOL? As noted it is rate limited and I believe on devnet that is 1 per account per (don't know the rate acceptable)
Hi. Hope you are ok. Im trying to do a pull request  of the logo of my token on the Solana Token List repo. My token doesn't have a logo yet because when I uploaded it, the json was a mess and it only let me automerge if I upload only the token information to the json.

But now every time I try to upload the logo, it rejects me. There are no erased lines, only adhesions and yet it does not automerge. Any ideas or suggestions how to do it?

hello everybody, i'm trying to do something like, that if user burns their token they get a reward token in return i have most of it figured out, i'm a bit confused on the transfer part. Since a wallet would own be owning the reward token as they are the one minting it. 
So to transfer the token without having to get that wallet involved do i need to delegate the reward token to my program or do i need to do something else?

Phantom is one wallet in the ecosystem that's been gaining popularity recently, yes.  It's not "main" or "official"
I can't find the Token struct in Solana or Spl-token docs.
Thanks for this!
Main wallet is phantom, no?

Is there nothing like metamask/ronin for Solana that can add networks?
It's a sort of meta tx. I give to a user signed data that he put in the instruction data of a tx to my program that do a transfert using the spl-token and the data. The user can recreate a new tx with the same data and do another transfer. I want that the user can only use one time the signed data.
how can i use spl-token ``new Token()`` if i dont have access to a signer from a web wallet?
I don't really understand your problem franky
A nonce in the spl-token data account will have helped me.
Hey does anyone has any tutorial for making our own staking/farming platform for own SPL-token ?
My problem is that its the instruction data that determine the transfert (the program call the transfert function of spl-token with instruciton data).
yes, if you use a different blockhash
Ok but if I create a new Tx with the same instruction data, it will be executed?
Hello, Is there any API that allows me to get metaplex NFT Attributes/Image from the blockchain?
The transaction's recent blockhash [1] serves a similar purpose in Solana.  The blockhash you include in your transaction will expire in a couple minutes, at which point your transaction cannot be replayed

> I find it odd the main wallet is closed source
What do you think the main wallet is?
Hello, I have a problem with the possibility to reply instruction data of transactions to my program. I have a program that do a transfer using receive instruction data, sort of meta tx. I want to avoid the tx signer to replay the instruction data. On ETH there a nonce for each account. Is there something equivalent on Solana. First I thought to create a data account for each tx signer to put the nonce in it. But most the signer will do only one tx so most data account will exist only for one tx. I didn't find and example of an equivalent of nonce management for instruction data. Perhaps there is a reason?
Does Solana has any open surce wallets / dexs / block explorers?
I find it odd the main wallet is closed source

but i did it like this
i just did it
oh shit
Use an Elastic IP to get around that.
Just figured this out for anyone else who runs into this. Devnet Solana blocked tons of AWS public IPs because some knucklehead was spamming devnet from AWS.
wrap SOL is a mint so just treat it as a normal token.
the main different is to sync its balance

actually does grinding addresses have sense at all? I mean ok there might be 'beautiful' beginnings/endings of the adress, ok. I also tried to grind with same parameters two times in a row and see it produced different results, but still, so I mean is it secure to have grinded addresses? how big chance if someone find same keypair?
yup, probably the only way
Implement it
hey, is there any way to enforce `solana-keygen grind` to use GPU?
im new to the ecosystem.  I assumed it would prompt me for the password if I put public key and tried to sign a message
Why it keeps showing automerge-error on my add-token PR?
yes, go to the metaplex discord CM is standard
hey dev team! Is there a good guide or reference for how NFT collections are made on Solana? Am very familiar with ERC721//1155 on ETH and wondering what's an equivalent of that for Solana?  Not sure if Metaplex's Candy Machine is the general go-to? Thanks!
Anyone else know of a fix? I'm getting this with the Serum one also.
Getting the following error when I attempt to do an airdrop on devnet: `Error: RPC request error: cluster version query failed: HTTP status client error (403 Forbidden) for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com/)`
im finding no resources on this
how can i wrap sol in js?
Pubkey makes less sense.  Technically someone could want to do it on purpose, but very unlikely
Well it could also be a Ledger URI
Ah we could stat the file in 4) and tell you you're wrong I suppose
so basically the error message was confusing because the address in the config is supposed to be a filepath, not a wallet address, and I didn't know that.  but the error message shown doesn't really directly relate to that
Is this the place to be if I want to learn how to develop on Solana?
to be honest I'm not sure how it was set up incorrectly.  my process was:

1. set up filesystem key (this was weeks ago)
2. it didn't work, didn't know why
3. set up a keypair without an output file per https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/paper-wallet#seed-phrase-generation
4. run `solana-config set --keypair <output address of step 3>`
5. realize it doesn't work that way, delete the line from the config
6. generate a new filesystem key
7. it works
Glad you got it working, but incorrectly how?  We should at least not mislead you with some nonsense error message
nvm the issue was caused by setting up a filesystem key incorrectly
the code looks ok.
a recent blockhash will expire in 2 mins. (approx.)
if you want to get rid of it, you can look at durable nonce system.
https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/durable-tx-nonces
https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/advanced/durable-nonce/
are there any resources on a mint website that limits the amount of NFTs a wallet address can mint or if you are able to "whitelist" certain addresses from presale/public sale purposes?
Also after creating tx is there some kind of time limit before signing txt by wallet?
```async function createTransferTransaction(fromPubkey, toPubKey, amount) {
    const provider = getProvider();
    if (!provider.publicKey) {
        return;
    }
    let transaction = new web3.Transaction().add(
        web3.SystemProgram.transfer({
            fromPubkey: fromPubkey,
            toPubkey: toPubKey,
            lamports: amount,
        })
    );
    transaction.feePayer = provider.publicKey;
    console.log("Getting recent blockhash");
    const anyTransaction = transaction;
    anyTransaction.recentBlockhash = (
        await connection.getRecentBlockhash()
    ).blockhash;
    return transaction;
}```
Does this look alright?
`connection.getRecentBlockhash()` in pending state
awesome thank you folks. i appreciate the dungeon
if you're asking for some kind of "VIP" support, hello@ is one way to start that discussion.
The last one for sure.  First one is pretty subjective
For general community support, yes this is one of the places to seek help.
if our engineering team decides to do this, this discord can help us make it great and answer our questions?
to the point. ok thank you
hello@solana.com is usually a good place to start
where do i find these ppl
should i go to a fancy bar? im in the bay area
yeah but the BD folks you need to talk to about that don't hang out in the engineering dungeon.
does solana foundation offer grants or hands-on help for defi projects doing this sort of thing? I know they are quite resourced
step one ‚úÖ
You're in one of those support resources right now üôÇ
Hey I'm representing a defi protocol that is ready to launch on ethereum, but we're concerned by gas fees and not-ready L2 solutions, so we're seriously looking at Solana. Are there any resources or even better support offered by Solana or Solana Foundation to help us make this transition?
I'm constructing multiple tx before signing
js call for getrecentblockhash is not completing, what could be wrong.
This is my first time building on solana. 

I'm trying to create random accounts and listen to transactions (payments) that happens on those accounts. 

I have been able to create the account address and I know the secret keys but I can't find a way and don't know how to listen to every lastest transaction that happens on the account addresses. 

Pls any guide will be helpful. 

I'm using the web3 API  üôèüèΩ
We like PRs
Solana has too many good things to allow such a big security risk
This would be dangerous not just for the ones being scammed, but for the whole community
Can someone from the team pls tell me if there is some kind of work going on to update the 'upgrading system'? It should not be so easy in a trustless blockchain to allow anybody owning a program to upgrade It and totally steal everything from users. If an AMM decides to steal everything from the pools they could just upgrade their program and only allowing a final transaction that move every single token to a single wallet
don't have a job and can't afford new computer
oop, thought i was in there.. Apologies üòÜ
Metaplex people can. Take it to their discord
Only masochists are using windows
so nobody developing on solana uses windows?  seems like others would have this problem if that's the only thing causing it
it does not
If it has a relatively new version of MacOS, definitely.  Most of the team uses Macs
it doesn't get internet though üåö
I can dig out my old macbook I suppose
do you think my developer experience would be smoother on osx?
Hmm... probably a bug.  I can try to look later.  Windows is definitely the bastard child around here
any way to resolve this?
my cluster version is 1.8.4 while local version is 1.7.15.
I don't know what else to try at the moment but this:

Though not strictly necessary, the CLI will generally work best when its version matches the software version running on the cluster. To get the locally-installed CLI version, run:

```
solana --version
```
To get the cluster version, run:

```
solana cluster-version
```
Ensure the local CLI version is greater than or equal to the cluster version.
does anyone else use wsl with windows 10 and does everything work fine?
same error
I'm updating now maybe that will fix
windows 10 using wsl subsystem
What platform?
`solana --version
solana-cli 1.7.14 (src:5bdb8242; feat:1824749018)`
which version of the CLI tools?
I wouldn't expect it to, no
`solana address` doesn't require any signature
I just created the address and linked it to my local config using `solana config set --keypair <keypair>`
running `solana address`
Probably helps to let us know what you're trying to do an how
Anyone know how to supply signature for your public key?

```Error: missing signature for supplied pubkey: <my address>```
I suspect there's a bunch of arb bots on serum/raydium/orca and more right now, so there's a big competition
If you simulate and submit your transaction with no transactions in between, you are more likely to get your successful transaction. You can run a lot of tests to see how well your simulation vs transaction does on whatever you're executing
Oh okay bro , thank you üôèüèº I was wondering then I can send SOL to metamask just by Smartchain network
Solana is a completely different platform. It isn't using the same RPC API
Same situation can cause a simulation to fail but execution to succeed
Can you specify for me the reason please ? They dont have a chain ID ?
Also https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/web-wallets - Solana doesn't work with metamask
Yes I was check that bro, can you tell me RPC to use in them ??
Why are you cross posting and wasting two people's time?
But why is that ? I just need its RPC and the chain ID
Googled solana rpc urls https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints
so I understood that if simulate succeeds, there is still chance that execution might fail, as per the example you mentioned. I am asking the reverse - if a  simulation fails, what is the chance of the execution succeeds ?
Metamask doesn't work with Solana
Hello everyone, please can someone tell me what is the RPC for Solana network so I can add it to my metamask??
If you simulate a transaction on serum order books and it is ok, then someone buys a bunch of tokens, your transaction to buy those tokens and settle may fail still
thanks Jacob, a follow up, what is the probability of a simulation failing but the execution succeeding ? if the probability is zero, then I can safely rely on the simulation call to do precheck.
Program data like this https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/master/test/bpf-loader.test.ts#L29

Did you check out `load` from web3 https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/b45f065/src/loader.ts#L59 ?

yeah so I have a testnet/validator and then I do solana deploy xyz
I have just got this same issue - phantom on chrome.
Did you deploy it yourself?
is there anyway to get the deployed contracts keypair from the target directory using the web3 stuff?
You could try simulating, yes. However, if it relies on some things like serum orderbooks or other things that update on the fly, it could still fail
I am running a bot that tries to invoke a program every minute. The program has some conditions that might suceed or fail. What is the best way for me to check if a program will succeed before actually invoke it in order to save trasnaction fee? Am I able to rely on the simulate() method to do the checking ?
There's a couple people that have built tools to determine this. Ask in metaplex https://discord.gg/metaplex

Specific program id
are program derived accounts owner set to a specific program ID or are they owned by the system program?
Is there some way to decompile a Solana program? Or at least extract the format of instruction (accounts, program_index, data...) that need to be provided to execute a particular smart contract?
wow, miserable
You have to change the network in your wallet to devnet. It is SOL only on devnet, but worthless
why does it have the same read out in the wallet?
omg
I don't want to be the bringer of bad news, but devnet SOL is worthless
or did I get scammed lol
is it still the same value?
You cannot move devnet SOL to mainnet-beta
it's not the same?
wait I don't understand
I would hope not. Devnet SOL  != Mainnet-beta SOL
I was just sent sol on the dev network, can't figure this out
hey is there anyway to move Solana from the devnet to the mainnet?
oh so ``get(..8)`` is the rest of them, i thought there was more after that
I just blocked them
they were blocked already it seems
You can see in the guide, it references that the first byte is used as the tag, and rest are used to get the `u64` representing the `amount`.
So `unpack_amount` is called with only what it needs, while `unpack` is called with everything and internally calls `unpack_amount` with the subset, or `rest` as referenced in the doc
that's totally a scam
That looks like a scam
So for those pull requests pending since a couple days ago, I imagine those will be reviewed and merged as before (2 weeks) and not within the 24 hours as stated here?
Hi, im working my way through this tutorial -- https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/
and Im not understanding this function in particular
```
    fn unpack_amount(input: &[u8]) -> Result<u64, ProgramError> {
        let amount = input
            .get(..8)
            .and_then(|slice| slice.try_into().ok())
            .map(u64::from_le_bytes)
            .ok_or(InvalidInstruction)?;
        Ok(amount)
    }
```

in particular I don't understand why we get the first 8 bytes from the input as opposed to the whole input?
For NFT related questions, try https://discord.gg/metaplex
inserting meta data for solana NFT creation
What are you trying to do?
in visual studio
can someone explain what: baseUri: "ipfs://NewUriToReplace" means? so what needs to be inserted?
You can do something like this https://github.com/saber-hq/merkle-distributor
Check out https://spl.solana.com/token#finding-all-token-accounts-for-a-specific-mint
You can make the user sign a message and verify the signature on the backend
Can be very slow, and in fact not recommended to use that way. You can't paginate `getProgramAccounts`
Look into token swap https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token-swap
Yes, for example... in one (1) txn I have `createaccount` (system program) and `initialze` which is my program instruction
You can use the same and get `<script src="https://unpkg.com/@solana/spl-token@latest/lib/index.iife.js"/>`
I'm looking for a reasonable straight forward way of airdropping tokens on solana, anyone did this recently and found any decent repo's etc? I've dabbled with two of them, but i cant really get my head around it.
how can you find the current holder of a token? do you need to fetch all the program accounts from the mint? or is there a way to do it directly from the token address
There is no SMPC on Solana today
Consider the contradiction in your request
Is there a good way to send encrypted data to solana, have the program decrypt it, and use the data to perform a calculation? 
I was hoping that the derived accounts contain a private key they can use but they do not: https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#private-keys-for-program-addresses
or if that's even an issue internally in the core?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Was hoping to get some help on this one - not sure if I should be submitting another PR or not
I believe in Tulip and Mango's case, they're awarded some of the funds. Tulip has some service fee. Mango has a bunch of docs on their liquidator here https://docs.mango.markets/development-resources/liquidator
<@785084693023424542> thank you very much
Is the person who cranks rewarded some amount?
Hmm interesting dynamic
As long as it is worth it for anyone to try to "crank" your extra functionality, people will do it, keeping it "decentralized" in nature.
A lot of teams use what is considered a permissionless crank to do fund settlement, liquidations, and more. The idea is if you can incentivize someone to execute your transaction that performs extra functions, you can get it done.

Mango does this with liquidations. Tulip Protocol does this with asset management. Serum does this with order matching/execution.
on-chain is just for global synchronization
Seems like Solana really needs an off-chain counterpart for mildly advanced functionality.
Yeah, still not ideal.
You could have a permissionless instruction that triggers the funds transfer.  So not automatic but anybody who's willing to pay the transaction fee could cause it to happen
Can't the funds be transferred automatically?
Current programs need someone to trigger the distribution with a special client.
Yes.
unless the treasury is a PDA owned by the program
would need the treasury to sign that though
In this case I wanted to automatically distribute the mint amount from the treasury.
yep, or just the normal RPC methods.  There's also an accounts database plugin layer that you could use as well, but this requires running a (non-voting) validator node: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/accountsdb-plugin-interface#solana-accountsdb-plugin-interface
can't you trigger an instruction from inside that account's program?
yeah the answer is no.  typically you'd use an off-chain cron job to kick a program periodically if desired
mvines, just so I'm clear, are off-chain listeners using RPC PubSub WebSocket Endpoint?
Which again, seems like a huge limitation.
I am expecting the answer to be no.
Related question, can you trigger a program when something happens to an account?
off-chain listener yes
Off-chain, right?
i'm doing something similar for my project
If I could check transactions, I could do it for any token.
I would have to run that listener for all tokens I am interested in.
you could ceate a listener and have that update account data
I actually wanted to check if a metadata account has been updated or not.
Yes, but it seems like a huge limitation that on-chain programs can't do that.
yeh, you'll have to get account A to send account B 1 SOL inside the first instruction and sae to account data
Oh no, just an example.
sounds like an escrow?
Accounts are used to hold state between transactions
For example, if I want to write a program that checks if account A sent account B 1 sol or not.
not possible
I am interesting in accessing instruction data of a previous transaction.
yep, of course
Yes, that is in the same instruction.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/sysvars#instructions
Yes, so just to be clear, you can't even access the instruction data?
not on-chain, right.  Transaction don't really exist on-chain, only the instructions that a transaction contains
But that means you can't verify past transactions?
Hmm that could be a possible solution, thanks.
instead you'd inspect account state that was generated by past transactions
Not possible
Anyone?
yes.  and looking into improvements. feedback has been heard. thank you.
Hello there is there anyone checking the github solana ecosystem repo
Thank you, i'll do that
That's a good idea
That is a possible solution
Maybe load the arguments for B into the PDA, then wipe them when you are done?
Something that people have done is the following to validate that at least a signature they expected came in: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/d3f1e280909efce1d7390eb186d4acc5adf6197d/token/program/src/processor.rs#L701
Something you could do is verify that a PDA was passed in the accounts and program signed for that address. You run into problem with multiple levels of CPI though. There's not really a `msg.sender` equivalent in programs
yes
So B invokes A, and you want to verify on A that the invocation came from B?
Any help please

your diff is probably containing extra whitespace changes - make sure it contains only the token
Humm, im not quiet sure to understand, it wasn't my question.
And every accounts is owned by a program, pda or not, on curve or not.
But I am not 100% sure, if someone could confirm then it would be great.
I think the fact that the PDA has data means it was created by the program.
Because no one else can write to that account.
Hi,
If i have a SC `A` and SC `B`, how can i check on `A`, that `B` invoked him ?
The thing to do would be to sign the first account, and check the pubkey match with the pubkey of `B`. But since (if im correct) it 's not a PDA with a seed/none i can't sign it, or is there a way to sign the program account itself ?
Thank you
huuum I see, It's easy to be lost amongst all address/account/program I'm not yet used to it, Thanks ‚úåÔ∏è
e.g.
```rust
/// Extracts the service fee from the users program account and
/// credits the service account
fn charge_service_fee(
    program_account: &AccountInfo,
    service_account: &AccountInfo,
    amount: u64,
) -> ProgramResult {
    // If tracking can not afford transaction fee
    if **program_account.try_borrow_lamports()? < amount {
        return Err(SampleError::InsufficientFundsForTransaction.into());
    }
    // Debit user and credit service
    **program_account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? -= amount;
    **service_account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? += amount;
    Ok(())
}
```
nothing to add to this?
Custom programs can move lamports from one account (that is owned by the program) to any account (does not need to be owned by the program)
Hi, can someone please confirm if it is possible for on chain contracts to access past transactions?
```
        "instructions": [
          {
            "parsed": {
              "info": {
                "destination": "6JEXAA5r7J5KRE6ALQB9RMhRbz3A327PmPVbdh22FsGj",
                "lamports": 229995000,
                "source": "AQswueysKuGf2naRWteHoJASkMjRdpaqvyrHCPJh9dWH"
              },
              "type": "transfer"
            },
            "program": "system",
            "programId": "11111111111111111111111111111111"
          }
```
Is it possible that another "program" (like not an official one) could move around lamports/custom token so that meta > pre/post Balances/TokenBalances **cannot** catch it ? Or is it simply impossible and safe to assume `pre/post Balances/TokenBalances` will always catch changes ?

ah wait, when I first transfer funds in, I need to send to the associated token accounts owner I think
this creates an associated account with the owner as the programTokenAccountAddress, which is only owned by itself, not the program or the PDA

has anybody created associated accounts for pda?
for some reason the address I get back is the owner of the associated account, not the account self
```  mint = new PublicKey("DvrzbsoHqFwmFmA2KA5kxoMoM5HZaVmG1o9KUsqBf1Xr");
  program_pda = new PublicKey("Ahj4JxN7HgPCSnvtV7Xou4KtWznNhSjWTXCoCYx7DDDh");

  const programTokenAccountAddress = await getTokenWallet(
      program_pda,
      mint,
  );

  // programTokenAccountAddress = 56zLRGKwoSxt4FAywR3QHLqb2fRMv6LGdDQMaNpvj9Jb```
Hey guys, wondering if I can get some help. Trying to run the solana-test-validator (sorry if I am in the wrong channel) but I can't seem to get it running. It has ran once before when I first installed the CLI but since a reboot I can't get it working (tried removing test-ledger folder, reinstalling the cli etc.) any help appreciated, I am on a macbook pro (not m1)

Hi!
Can someone help me with serializing data from SOLANA schema?
I should have tried to execute contract, because it is really work) Thank you.
It wont, and if it is, use a long giant seed
I'm using  PublicKey.createWithSeed(userWalletAddress, 'mySeed', Pubkeys.myProgramId) to find deterministic address of user accounts to store some data using my program after creating an account with SystemProgram.createAccountWithSeed. Is it possible that createWithSeed will return an error like 'Invalid seeds, address must fall off the curve'?

Should I use findProgramAddress instead of createWithSeed?
Thank You so much for the quick response <@!388004212270956545> !! Please let me check it
I know little about creating NFTs, the only thing I know it that can mint them via Metaplex. Maybe you can find more info there
any support guys, ive been trying for days
Hello Solana Devs, is there any reference implementation for creating Upgradeable NFTs
Hm that's annoying, but nothing to worry about. a later version will definitely not show the warning -- the syscall is enabled on all clusters, so it'll work
Hello guys, I've been trying to get signatures of all confirmed transactions using Solana Py's get_confirmed_signature_for_address2 and also get_signatures_for_address. But none of them seem to work properly, that is, I get an empty list, no signatures at all. Has anyone implemented that in Python that could help me?
any idea

why do i get this error when i try to start a test validator?
Hey, anyone have experience with listing your token to the `solana-labs/token-list` repo, I tried doing it but I got the following error:
`error validating schema: chainId: conflicting values 103 and 0` but the chainId I provided was `101` which is mainnet
It doesn't help. I still get warning
woo! üéâ
thank you, you've saved me hours/days üòÑ
I think you've got me what I needed üôÇ
hm and then I don't have to worry about transfering ownership, just the transfer of the token
how about using their associated token account by default?
cool that's similar to what I'm trying but I'm stuck working out how to get my users token account to pass in, like what the js/ts code would be for that
In that case, have the user pass their token account and the program's associated token account, and then in your program, validate that the program's associated token account is correct, and transfer from the user to your program's account, and then do the rest of your processing
Ok thanks!
jon I"m sorry to keep asking questions but I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how I should be doing this...

I need my user to able to send an instruction with some data and also one token of a mint I control, to my program

if I just have the instruction send one token to my programs associated token account, I"m not sure how I can check they've actually done this?

does it need an off-chain helper
it'll be the same as testnet / devnet
And do you know what the fee is  that is associated with making a token on the main net?
yes exactly
Depends on your use case. If you want the program to own it, your best bet is to create an associated token account owned by a program-derived address
Can you try upgrading your CLI to 1.8.3 too?
It's part of account creation.  To fully create an account, you must first allocate data for it, then transfer enough lamports to make it rent exempt, and then assign it to a program.  Once it's assigned, the program can modify the data and lamports as much as it wants
Hello sir
Take a look at https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getblockproduction for slot success rate, you can do `num_produced_blocks / num_leader_slots` for each one. as for uptime, you'll want to look at the voting record from https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getvoteaccounts
Hey, same here! I also tried to encode to 58-base but it didn't work as well.
Ahh ok. So I just change the network to main net then just make a new token?
see https://github.com/Bonfida/token-vesting/tree/master/program
ah, I can't use associated account someone said, I need to create auxiliary account so I transfer ownership to my program, does that code still apply?
Hello we are creating a dex, are there any ws we can use for charting data?
so it's OK to fund it with no tokens, then have the user transfer funds into that aux account on the next acton?
Hey gyus wanted to know these things: 
> How can we lock the spl - tokens on contract 
> Withdraw them after the lock duration is over and lastly 
> How do we map the addresses on the contact itself
The current spl-token package is a bit unergonomic for uses like that... you'll have to create the instructions yourself and send them to the network using the instruction creators: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/f83240a8684bc20cbf9c592fa2453c7a2103076b/token/js/client/token.js#L2306
I'am using solana 1.7.15 and solana_program 1.8.3
you have to recreate the token on mainnet, the networks are totally distinct
hi, what is system_instruction::assign use for ?
as percentage
Hey, how to get validator uptime / slot success rate?
Ok, Thanks for the help.
`solana transfer -ufrom devnet <address> -uto mainnet <address> 100000000 --allow-instant-billionaire-mode`
but what if my mint already exists (i.e. I've generated it via CLI)?

how do I create a auxiliary account for my user in the frontend?
hey everyone, I'm having hard time making so a user can include tokens in there instruction to my solana program

currently in my tests I can generate a random mint, create a random mint and have it create an account 

```    mintA = await Token.createMint(
      provider.connection,
      payer,
      mintAuthority.publicKey,
      null,
      0,
      TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
    );

    initializerTokenAccountA = await mintA.createAccount(initializerMainAccount.publicKey);```
I worked it out.. it was my wifi for some reason it worked when I went onto hotspot‚Ä¶ anyways how do I move a token from the devnet to the main net? Thanks
We don't support M1 out of the box just yet, so you'll have to use rosetta or build the test validator yourself from source
Hm, looks like a mismatch of your token accounts -- the associated token account for mint 8ZYeyxPV1KAXMpT2m3k391KiAgVooZ2omakvfztTabtE on your default wallet is HyJ289G5cKSzxVkcnu5QSQMF4vgsRQBQDcJHH7gD775E, but the linked instruction shows a source account of `9mBs...`, so you may be using different default wallets.  If you want to transfer from the `9mBs...` account, you can instead specify `--from 9mBs....`
I am working on a custom stake program on solana can you share resources i wanted to start from scratch. And please add me in rust-community-outreach channel too. thank you
Certainly! You have pass in the token account to the program, and `Account::unpack` the data to find out the balance
Strange, it's been enabled for a bit on all networks... are you using an old version of the tools?
Thanks, I'll double-check
is your fee payer wallet the one that was used to create mint and it's account. it would seem that the mint owner and fee payer wallet might be different
Sounds like your config is expecting a default keypair from another location.  It seems like you created a keypair at the default location in that earlier command, so you'll need to do something like `solana config set --keypair C:\Users\coope\.config\solana\id.json` and then the airdrop should work
https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/tour/mint-to.html

Throws an error `Program log: Error: owner does not match` What could be the problem?
very strange, do any of the other networks work? you can try `solana config set -ut` and then `solana airdrop 1` to see if it's only devnet that's an issue
I'm writing a function to transfer (sweep) nfts from one account to another
For example https://solscan.io/account/C65WFNUgdT2nt2Cck6iY1RyAqvLLQ9sMiCJ1W72hCzNq this is Start Atlas DOI 
```
SPL Token Address HAWy8kV3bD4gaN6yy6iK2619x2dyzLUBj1PfJiihTisE
Token Account (in the wallet) C65WFNUgdT2nt2Cck6iY1RyAqvLLQ9sMiCJ1W72hCzNq
```
So when I create transaction to transfer, can I use following code?
```
    let transaction = new web3.Transaction().add(
        web3.SystemProgram.transfer({
            fromPubkey: fromPubkey,
            toPubkey: toPubKey,
            lamports: amount,
        })
    );
    transaction.feePayer = provider.publicKey;
```
For the given example account amount = 43 if I want to transfer all tokens?
Or does the code only works with SOL?
Hm, looks like only three transactions on mainnet: https://explorer.solana.com/address/5rcQeTcqpusdNJecSVM6wbEUEERBSM7rBAAq8F5WJ2Cn are you expecting more?
ok
issue plz?
I looked quickly through the code, looks like it's just not done
Hi there, it'll depend on the derivation path of your key -- you can work through these docs to get your wallet: https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/paper-wallet#creating-a-paper-wallet
```
            PubsubClient::slot_updates_subscribe("ws://localhost:8900",
                move |update| {
                    println!("{:?}", update);
                }
            )?;
```
I tried this, nothing happens
sounds like a bug -- the intention is likely that ws are opened and usable, so that you can develop against them
It may not be formatted correctly... are you using it as in this example from getMultipleAccounts? https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getmultipleaccounts
oh gosh I gonna kill myself! Binary class has property .buffer üôÇ lol, sorry guys

`invalid account data for instruction` is a common error when you pass a mismatch account. I'm just guessing you pass a wrong token account not for sure.
you have to debug it by yourself.

Hai , Do we have any methods to find the number of wallets created from a seed phrase ?
some types use extra bytes to cover the data type or some other overhead. when you print the raw byte array out, or the byte array before/after serialized, you can see.
i had to create two struct one that had the actual value and the other was a vector of the first struct..that approach kinda seems a bit messy
you should just be able to apply the same pattern of serialization then.
```rust
const GreetingSchema = new Map<any, any>([
    [
        GreetingAccount,
        {
            kind: 'struct',
            fields: [
                ['counter', 'u32'],
                ['is_initialized', 'u8'],
                ['tokenAddress',['pubkey']],
            ]
        }
    ],
]);```
here's one thing that i think haven't checked or what but the serialized length for this schema is returned 41 when it should've been 4+1+32=37 i dont get why there are 4 extra bytes? i guess they are being allocated because the pubkey is an array?
yeah thanks!
i gotit
ahhh
if i pressing enter, again haha
right now, it serves its purpose, it will likely evolve at some point in the future. so customizations are not recommended at this time, for compatibility.
its probably just not showing any input. it should.. be there though, hidden, or not echoing terminal. I think.  did you try pressing enter?
yeah followed their practices and was successfully able to create a whitelist of addresses. i guess doing the same would also get my job done. but it would've been better if i was able to just serialize and deserialize the structure that i have right now
<@!785084693023424542> Does the SPL program on chain right now support customization? By which I mean add logic to the program? Or is it set in stone?
That is what I thought too.
anything that you create that is not adopted by the eco system would be considered custom and 'likely' incompatible with any other apps or programs, and that includes wallets, explorers, or anything else..  

if you 'issued' your own will.shu-token, what is likely, is a wallet (like phantom) would not recognize it, any other app, would not recognize it as a token, and potentially only your program, if done correctly, with the help of a client, would allow the user to interact with it.
hello guys. why i cant copy and paste if i use the command 'solana-keygen recover'? also i cant type anything
each structure or type in rust may need to be looked at for serialization, reading, writing, and dealing with the data and the type. if you want it to also go back and forth to a client, both the client and the program will have to know how to properly serialize and deserialize the data and what to expect. Look at how metaplex deals with this struct. in the program. and in the client. if you can follow this pattern with your objects you should be able to handle most things end to end.
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/rust/token-metadata/program/src/state.rs#L72-L83
But I can issue a token within my own written program, not expecting it to work with SPL tokens? Will it work when users interact with each other within my program?
you can customize SPL-Token for your own purposes, but no, you cannot extend or customize it and expect it to be compatible with the greater ecosystem and spl-token at this time.
Hello, can I write my own program to issue a token instead of using Solana Program Library (SPL) to issue tokens?
There's another thing that i'm trying to do..
i have struct in my program with only one field of type Pubkey. i want to store the addresses of tokens that are successfully minted. I have been able to store a single address successfully now i want to change that field to ```Vec<Pubkey>``` but i'm not able get the program to work it gives me an error ```failed to serialize or deserialize data of unknown account``` even though i'm creating and sending the correct account address.. any help here would be great!
```rust
pub struct Counter {
    /// number of greetings
    pub counter: u32,
    is_initialized: bool,
    address:Vec<Pubkey>
}```
this is the struct for that.
```rust
const GreetingSchema = new Map<any, any>([
    [
        GreetingAccount,
        {
            kind: 'struct',
            fields: [
                ['counter', 'u32'],
                ['is_initialized', 'u8'],
                ['tokenAddress',['pubkey']],
            ]
        }
    ],

this is the schema for it.
i'm accessing the reward token supply or you can say i will already have them minted and would only transfer a specific amount when the user burns their token.
by your answer i think i got what i need to do. and yes when the user will get the reward a token account will be created with the mint address of the reward token.
Thanks you!
Thanks mate
there is a decode function in the package
https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs58
I just need that raw 32 byte array back
you mean you want use a pubkey string to get a keypair object? if yes you can't.
or you just want to get the raw 32 byte array back?
I used " newAcc.publicKey.toBase58() " to enocde , how to decode this
pubkey is just 32 byte array.
when you use base58 encode it, you can use base58 decode to retrieve the origin array.
may i know how to revert it back  ?
Thanks!
you can use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress
to get history then use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
to get detail
maybe look at 
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#addSignature
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#sendTransaction
maybe https://dev.to/cogoo/solana-how-to-send-custom-instructions-via-instruction-data-4g9g

Hi, I am looking at Solana as a potential place to port my blockchain game to, is there a place to post notices to look for developers interested in partnering up on a close to pre-sale mvp?

my project: https://enter-the-sphere.com (currently going on Polygon, but then I noticed Solana)
Hai all, I need to store the created multiple wallet Key-pair locally for that i convert the generated wallet key-pair as string using JSON.stringify(publicKey) but it returns an object as [["0", 117], ["1", 198], ["2", 182], ["3", 158], ["4", 252], ["5", 248], ["6", 164], ["7", 66], ["8", 238], ["9", 249], ["10", 181], ["11", 13], ["12", 47], ["13", 130], ["14", 127], ["15", 123], ["16", 99], ["17", 241], ["18", 125], ["19", 145], ["20", 215], ["21", 68], ["22", 238], ["23", 193], ["24", 48], ["25", 247], ["26", 15], ["27", 49], ["28", 65], ["29", 176], ["30", 58], ["31", 120]]
, may i know the reason ?
can someone share resources for working on rust contract other than hello world example
i only want to sign my transaction separately and broadcast it later
// Sign transaction, broadcast, and confirm 
var signature = await web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction( connection, transaction, [from] );‚Ä®‚Ä®above given method do 3 task at the same time‚Ä®‚Ä®is there a way if i just want to sign my transaction only‚Ä®
i was using metaplex ... in there they heavilly use transaction wallet instance from ... wallet adapter given by react from solana-adapater‚Ä®‚Ä®so they are able to do all these three task separately‚Ä®‚Ä®if you guys can help in it , would be very thankful to you guys
Hey mate, find anything good?

When I check Raydium Program, I see a large number of spam transactions continuously during that time, is there any way to fix this situation?
hi, my solana node crashes or lags every time a new ido happens on raydium
Hey, hoping someone can help me out. I'm trying to update an NFT, and when I pass in the private key of the update authority I get this error message
`Error: Transaction failed: You cannot unilaterally verify another creator, they must sign`

When I *also* sign with the creator private key, I get this message
`Error: unknown signer: <creator-pubkey>`

Why can't I update the NFT? I have both the private keys necessary
hi, i want to use ed25519-dalek online to verify sth, but in this crate has rand crate(i guess use for generate keypair) is not work on-chain, any great idea for handle this gracefully?
Thank you,
I'm trying to sign multiple send multiple transactions at once, I'm using phantom wallet to sign multiple tx but serialisation of those signed are failing.
seeing this in the PR for my token update - seems like it got merged, but it's marked as failed & I don't see the token updated in explorer. Any idea?
Use getSignaturesForAddress and getTransaction as stated earlier
Right. For that NFT mint, you can just get all transactions related to it and build this
My understanding is that metaplex is a program you can hit to mint. If I am wrong, then I apologize. Check metaplex to see if there's anyone else that is trying to do what you're doing https://discord.gg/metaplex
So on-chain programs can mint new NFTs? Can you share me a resource for this?
I would like to get trading history for each NFT item in NFT marketplace. for example, someone mint NFT and list it for sale then other guy bid for this Auction, like this trading history.
similar with opensea history
On chain program. On chain instruction executed
I‚Äôm not sure what this means. What‚Äôs an example of this? Is it an on-chain program? Is it an off-chain API?
When there is a swap or transfer, there should be both. If not, you're going to have to do more analysis across multiple transactions
Permissionless crank could be something hitting the program to auto mint any "bred" NFTs, but anyone could call the instruction.
I get all transactions by getSignaturesForAddress and used getTransaction to get details, the details include accounts array but there isn't former owner address, only new onwer address.
Would that be off chain?
Both solutions are decentralized
Have them submit the transaction with the two. Or have them "stake" both NFTs, and have a permissionless crank going on in the background that would mint their bred NFT if certain conditions are met
Like as a user with two NFTs, how would they breed them to get a new NFT based on characteristics of those
Who‚Äôs the one doing the minting?
Create the token accounts and everything with another program using CPI
What do you mean third party? You can mint with metaplex's on chain program.
There isn't a phantom discord anymore to my knowledge
Try the anchor-py channel in the anchor discord
The goal is to have it create new NFTs on-chain in a decentralized way. Is the best way to have a third party centralized mint new NFTs?
Yep, you can send a raw transaction like this https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/offline-nonce-account/offlineNonceAccount.js#L106. You can see in the code multiple signatures are done and then sent
For NFT breeding, I don't think you need to create another program. You can mint using metaplex, and create token accounts for those mints.
You should probably hop into Bonfida's discord and ask them
What you can do it grab all transactions an account made with a nft marketplace program and display as the trading history. Using getSignaturesForAddress https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress and getTransaction should do the job
can someone invite me to Phantom discord please
Any python programmer here?
i am trying  python solana sdk and i am wondering how to deserialise the rpc response data
I'm trying to send token and seeing following error
```transaction.ts:583 Uncaught Error: Signature verification failed
    at Transaction.serialize (transaction.ts:583)
    at eval (eval at sendTokens (index.js:109), <anonymous>:1:14)```
transaction was constructed and then signed, but serialize funtion is failing
I just built a new server, and while testing it, I am getting an ARP poisoned cache attack blocked notification from my PC antivirus. No solana application was running. Is this normal for networked servers? Or should I investigate further
I have list of transactions signed, can I send them using `connection.sendRawTransaction` ? does it only send one tx?
How would you implement NFT breeding on-chain? Can programs create new programs?
Hey guys im working in a p2e game and i need to develop the vesting for our token , im following this :

Hello everyone, 

I'm looking for a dev with a clear schedule to 
partner with me on 2 potential brands / projects.

Please DM here or IG <@!758661005542424578> if interested.  Thanks, bless!

But I don't know how can I do it?
If anyone have experience then help me
The SPL Token account `owner` is a keypair, not an account.  Whether or not there's an account associated with that keypair's pubkey makes no difference to the SPL Token accounts existence/access
Just to make sure I understand as well, you don't have to have the `owner` account available on chain, but you can still sign the transfer transaction off chain with the keypair and have a secondary fee-payer. That way, as long as you still have the keypair, you can still transfer with the token account.
Thanks again!
All token accounts off the token program take the same space to my knowledge. Meaning same rent exemption amount
(I mean rent exemption)
But would rent be equal for USDC as it is for any other token?
Also - is rent the same for all token accounts? (I know it's different depending on the program)
Thanks for clarifying!
Worst case the wallet doesn't allow a secondary fee-payer so you can't send transactions before topping up the account at the `owner` address
Ah - thanks. I just thought that the space itself (the cost of storing the balance) would be deleted
It's just a keypair
Nothing would be lost, the SPL Token account's `owner` doesn't have to exist on chain at all
Hmm it's just that the docs say "Any account that drops to zero lamports is purged."
You would lose access, but I don't think you would lose the tokens. You could test this in local
After the rent in the SOL account runs out, do I lose the 1,000,000 USDC?
They still have rent
Say I have a SOL account with 0.0003 SOL and 1,000,000 USDC
Oh, like a regular primary account. I would expect the token accounts to still exist
SOL account?
Does a SOL account with token accounts have to be rent free?
What happens to token accounts if I create a SOL account and the rent runs out?
Thank you- this was helpful. We‚Äôve integrated SOL DEXes into our API. Happy to give you an api token if you‚Äôd like going forward. For anybody who has a similar question: Our logic is to compare the source of the transfer with the pub key with the account keys to compare the mint, and ensure the mint also exists in the destination account. That seems to work well. Comparing amounts did not work as there can be multiple swaps in the transaction and pre/post are net amounts.  I think it would be super helpful if mint was included in the transfer instruction along with source, destination, etc
awesome, thanks I will explore this much appreciated
Then you can just use transfer https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L862
You can use `getOrCreateAssociateAccountInfo` to either get or create the account if the user doesn't currently have that token account https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L536
AKA: how do we send tokens using solana web3 and "@solana/spl-token"
How do we get our users tokenAccounts inside js/ts so they can make transfers?

Like if I control the mint I can do:
`    initializerTokenAccountA = await mintA.createAccount(wallet.publicKey);`

But what happens if I don't control the mint, and the user already has an account. How can I get the the token account for their wallet?
Has anyone had any success setting this up for their project? or in general ofc.
https://github.com/saber-hq/merkle-distributor

I'd love to speak to you if that is the case.
noob question

Firstly, I understand that a transaction is made up of multiple instructions. an instruction is a call to a program

the 200,000 compute units, is that the alottment per Transaction? Or is that per Instruction? because i have heard people saying both
Hello there is there anyone looking into the github ecosystem repo
Definitely not a stupid discussion
Absolutely, just had to share the idea and even get a 'it's stupid' was fine, but I know this is a very tricky problem
Yes, I agree that now we are going on 'good faith' for at least open source programs. For closed source it is sheer madness to trust my wallet/SOL/NFT/etc. is safe. To solve this trust issue is just a deep and rich conversation as the tendrils go broad and deep.
Well You don't as much as you don't now, but it's up yo the user to decide if keeping to use the previous version or the new one
What assurance or proof do I have that any of the version came from clean code and can be trusted?
It seems like having versioned programs would just be incredibly expensive to devs
Yeah was following this thing. Was very much appreciated
You already will get a transaction for migration from v1 to v2 though.
Yeah It would imply security if You store different code into different accounts that would act as code recipient. 
The program id will have one fixed id as always but the actual code executed will be on different accounts cause they are being kept stored. 
A pda will be then derived from the program id in order for the program to sign It, but owned by the code which is the current version the user is using. So this way a pda will need both the code version and program id to sign the tx. This way an app should ask on their website for the user transaction to move the ownership to the new version of code
Anchor has verifiable builds as well. All the tools exist to make program upgrade "safe" for users. Just a nice UI/UX to show the user their risks and safeguards doesn't exist today
Versioning does not imply security, to <@!489206164270350337> point you need a 'trust' method beyond self attestation. A DAO could do it as well as a reputable code audit group that issued some kind of 'proof' that could be validated. It's a big discussion.
Sorry lower level
You could make the upgrade authority on a program a DAO, and the DAO has to vote on potential upgrades. Some do this today I think
With a versionizing system on a higher level this could be prevented
Not for that, not for user experience. For security improvement, for not allowing program owners to modify the code and not allowing them to act maliciously after an upgrade which could theorically not allow a user to retrieve his funds stored on a PDA
I dig that scheme daddy-o!
There's a lot of way people version programs today. Some will add a version at the beginning of account data, so that future upgrades can migrate them
It's literally a week that I am thinking about It and schematized the idea very well cause I know the Solana model, but can't really code It
A way of versionizing programs upgraded code
What are you thinking of?
Same place. There's both front end and back end in the mono repo
Lol sorry but as a frontender I can't really be efficient there
And what if I don't have coding skills of that particular language but still I know in depth what could improve a functionality?
Thanks
I'm not an admin but I've done this before: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

No, sorry
instructions are ordered as added and order finalized when signed and sent. processed in order. and all instructions must be successful for transaction to be considered successfully executed.
more info here:
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/transactions
do you happen to have any example of someone trying so?
Given a transaction with A and B instructions, does B get executed after or together with A?

awesome thanks for the pointer! will try it out
there is no easy way or setting to modify compute budget that I can recall, but a work around was to potentially use program test and setting the max compute units.   If you build from source I suppose you could change it manually.   ahh here is a chain that might be useful:

did you try running verbose logging on you local validator?
saw some stuff here about it being behind a feature but looks like that might be out of date? https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/runtime#features
anyone know a way to (temporarily) disable the compute budget limit for local solana-test-validator? added a bunch of `msg!`s that are eating it up
im there already
yep
Go through this https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools. Glad to have you here

Hi everyone! üëã 

Could someone please let me know how / where can I find blockchain developers who build in Solana? Is there a community group or a website or any other source I could check? I have an idea and I would like to hire professionals to build a dapp on solana.

Many thanks everyone üôè üòä
Usually the recommendation is to use WSL

hey guys so when i run spl-token create-token i get this error
Thanks <@!785084693023424542> , I really appreciate the quick response. I'm actually looking to dump all the transactions into Kafka so I can "push" notifications rather than pull through the web3 API. Should I reach out in <#560174212967432193> ?
This is what I wanna find
ty!!
oh wow exaktly what I was searching for! thanks for the answer and sorry for the "read the docs" question :p
right so the account inside the program should have an  account.amount field.  you can reference the token transfer function:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L203
are you asking how to check if a user/wallet has a token account or not?  https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account
In program!

Program already have token account which passed by client.
in the program or client?  for the program you have to pass in the account to the program from a client. and lots of examples are in the token program and related source codes:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token generally searching on `amount` will yield many results here.
you can use the web3 client mentioned above for subscriptions to logging and other calls.  for hardware reqs and how to, the <#560174212967432193>  channel may be more useful.  There is a bigtable to try and get an initial pull of more data. https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/rpc-transaction-history#accessing-bigtable
I have a question!

How I can get token balance on the token account in rust?
step released some source for staking and reward pools:
https://github.com/step-finance/reward-pool
And for solana, they have their stake-pool code in the Solana Program Library github.  https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/stake-pool
And anchor has examples as well in their test and examples folders in their github. https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/tutorials/tutorial-0.html
For Solana, you can use web3 client to call and query from a client, addresses, accounts, balance etc.
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html
other projects or protocols may have their own APIs or SDKs.
Use case: monitoring Solana transactions and triggering notifications when certain things happen
should be, for now, until something changes, for the minimum.
üëã hey folks, another beginner question: any details on hardware requirements to just download all solana data and keep syncing it to a computer?
this should help:

Hi, I made my token yesterday and minted the amount to my wallet. I was just wondering for my next step id like to list it on dexlab and also change the name and details of the token to show the logo and name on phantom wallet. Is there docs or guides how to do this?
<@!769993873995989082> 
```rust
let mut mystore = **account.try_borrow_mut_data()?;
let ser_data = yourvector.try_to_vec().unwrap();
sol_memcpy(mystore, &ser_data, ser_data.len();
```

Along those lines, i just quick typed it up so not tested
I dont understand why its so difficult for it to just accept an array of u8
I guess data.borrow_mut returns some kind of reference to the data that is mutable but whenever I try to mutate it I end up with the wrong types and ive been trying to fix the types for 6 hours now
initializer.serialize(&mut &mut initializer.data.borrow_mut()[..])?;
I cant figure this whole RefCell and RefMut thing out right now
there is too much type mumbo jumbo going on and although its very interesting, I am trying to get this done today
yes I know, but please give me the instruction
Copy it into the mutable account data
I am trying to save data in an account without learning the entirety of the greatness of the rust language.

I have the data serialized as Vec<u8> and an object of type accountInfo, how do i save the data
https://solana.fm if you want a GraphQL implementation
I believe this is in the works. You can try it out. Accounts DB plugin
Make sure your config is pointing to the specific network the account is on. Otherwise it will not find the account
Try asking in Metaplex's discord https://discord.gg/metaplex
Lots of examples here. You can find js bindings for the token-swap, token, token-lending, and stake pool

Fine, thanks for your reply! üôÇ
You could. If a site relies solely on the token list, I suspect that may cause some issues to that site+token
Okay, but can I, for example, create 9-decimals token, and set 0 decimals in solana token list? Are there any possible issues?
You can find also some information about Tower BFT here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/22a18a68e3ee68ae013d647e62e12128433d7230/docs/src/implemented-proposals/tower-bft.md
You cannot to my knowledge. This has caused problems for other tokens in the past, namely COPE had to remint their token
https://anchor.projectserum.com/
There is no current way. Anchor has been verifying contracts on chain, but it seems to be just in the early stages at this time.
However, it is a pretty long video overall
There's a pretty good resource here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKGhbC6Uync around the 20 minute mark. This video goes through the general consensus mechanisms for Solana.
Can I update decimals for created token?

use https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getProgramAccounts can get all address owned by program id
then use https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getAccountInfo can fetch data from those address
is there any web3 api to get data of a address from program id
i tried this again but still an issue for me üò¶ but thanks for the advice
I understand what you mean. thanks for your help
FYI the second method is to fetch token account which associated mint
take a example if you want to fetch all USDC accounts owned by `BYxyiQMNiVJx7QoCXJeXbWCtLiGr6dphXZ7EFQMmPAEk`

you use it and first param set `new PublicKey("BYxyiQMNiVJx7QoCXJeXbWCtLiGr6dphXZ7EFQMmPAEk")`
and the second set `{ mint: new PublicKey("USDC MINT ADDRESS HERE") }`
Please check it
there are two method. I have updated to make it more clear. maybe you take a look again.
if you want to fetch all token accounts owned by `BYxyiQMNiVJx7QoCXJeXbWCtLiGr6dphXZ7EFQMmPAEk`
you use the first method and replace the owner with `BYxyiQMNiVJx7QoCXJeXbWCtLiGr6dphXZ7EFQMmPAEk`
https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/advanced/token/get-all-token-account-by-owner/main.en.ts#L10-L22
oh ok, thank you! I will look into this, i did do something with LESS when i googled but maybe i did the wrong thing, so will have another look
This is something to do with LESS, not Solana. A quick google search says try updating LESS
anyone run into this issue and have a resolve?
Could you give a code snip?
As I said, it's the account address
What exact params are you setting?
I mean, where's the client minted? what's value do I have to set?
I set the public key to account address like  `BYxyiQMNiVJx7QoCXJeXbWCtLiGr6dphXZ7EFQMmPAEk`
But it doesn't working
got it, thanks.

You could try using this tool: https://github.com/EverydayLydian/Guidelines/blob/main/TokenSnapshot.md
When the account is debited or credited, the information is stored in each transaction and the end state is stored in the account
Hi, <@!788215642070581289> Thanks for your mail.. when the account's is buy and sell token, the token information is stored spl token?
Hey can you guys help me with something? Do you guys know how can i get the access to all the addresses that bought the NFT from a collection?

hi everyone! i have a small question, can i get a marketplace by tx signature?
Anyone here working with Solnet?
Need Help, want to develop my own mobile wallet for my SPL token, user who downloads the app will get my SPL wallet, how I can develop this?
yes
add your code at bottom of everything, do not add any space or line. just make sure u have no space between each lines as well
You can create a token with the spl-token app. creating a stablecoin is a little more involved. you either have to programmatically rebalance assets all the time or back it with real value.

creating a stablecoin isnt a matter of having a fungible token somewhere in the ether
Any examples or source???
Hi, i hope all doin well. I need help to how creating solana stablecoin for out token ??
Can anyone help??????
cool beans!
<@!814228493302497301> I found the solution. Here it is. This needs to be typed in VSCode terminal for windows users.

Yeah, I'm transferring from a program-owned faucet account, first argument to system_program::transfer in the code snippet
hello, how can I transfer tokens from a program owned token account? 
Currently it appears to need the program's sign to finish the transfer
So this issue with the Explorer incorrectly identifying SPL tokens as NFTs is ongoing after this revert: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/commit/9ff561134dcee9a6f538dee4a64fc707daabfb15
Worth checking why this call here returns NFT metadata: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/9ff561134dcee9a6f538dee4a64fc707daabfb15/explorer/src/providers/accounts/index.tsx#L236
And debug this for our SDOGE token. How can the mint address for an NFT collection be associated with an existing SPL (non-NFT) token?
Note that some malicious actor has pushed NFT metadata with same symbol 'SDOGE' as our SPL token, and somehow this seems to be associated with our token mint address.
See: https://explorer.solana.com/address/8ymi88q5DtmdNTn2sPRNFkvMkszMHuLJ1e3RVdWjPa3s
awesome. I'll have a look. THank you very much
Thanks for the contribution! Just gave you a quick review, we should be able to get this merged very soon
Is it safe to cast `unix_timestamp`s i64 to u64? Are there any cases when it can be negative?
dumb Q. The testnet (not the devnet) is where I want to test my apps?
sol?
is there a way possible to mass mint and airdrop an nft collection on sl?
A program may transfer FROM an account it owns, not a wallet account as that is owned by the System,
I was just trying to avoid this step in order to reduce the number of arguments when forming the ix. Simply theoretically, the client should not know the address of the token that will be minted to him. The program itself knows it - that's enough üôÇ
Can you tell me how to make an invocation that will be signed by the program itself? Should I read this about invoke_signed?
If you have that account pubkey stored somewhere in an account on-chain, first do a getAcconutInfo for that account, and from the data of that account pull the pubkey of the token address, and include it in the accounts metas list when you invoke your instruction. I'm doing the same thing with authorities and config accounts in my program
Got U! Thanks ! I suspected that this is where everything goes üôÇ
I'm just writing a proxy mint contract where the contract can mint a token (which he owns). I did initialization, where we create a PDA account with fields of administrator  and token address, the program also makes an invoke to initialize the token, where it indicates itself as the owner. Now how can I make the program do invocation for minting a token? It means that for invoke I need to transfer the `AccountInfo` of the smart contract itself, which should be a  signer.
Is there a way to do a GLOBAL installation (like npm) so that the damn thing will work across all project folders?
it cannot access accounts that were not in the accounts metas list of the instruction
Hi ! Is it possible to create an AccountInfo at runtime (meaning the process of executing an instruction by a smart contract)? Or can a smart contract use only those that were originally given to it ?!
any ideas?
I even have this line of code just before the transfer invocation: `assert_eq!(faucet_acc.owner, &crate::id());`
But still, the transaction is failing with: `Program SLCJFxQCsRef2HYGoXRd3jHBWM6dpVZVJrNsXU7hnrF failed: instruction spent from the balance of an account it does not own`
Hello, I'm creating a faucet account using:
```rust
invoke_signed(
  &system_instruction::create_account(
    payer_acc.key,
    faucet_acc.key,
    rent.minimum_balance(0),
    0,
    &crate::id(),
  ),
  &[payer_acc.clone(), faucet_acc.clone(), system_acc.clone()],
  &[&[FAUCET_ACCOUNT_SEED, &[faucet_bumps]]],
)?;
```
then when I'm trying in a later transaction (in the same unit test) to transfer from faucet to some random wallet using: 
```rust
invoke_signed(
  &system_instruction::transfer(
    faucet_acc.key,
    wallet_acc.key,
    topup_amount,
  ),
  &[faucet_acc, wallet_acc],
  &[&[FAUCET_ACCOUNT_SEED, &[bumps]]],
)?;
```
I'm hitting the following error:
```
failed to verify account 8a6u7QegKrpH833HvgSvbKspgVsiWPtJFsqDGrWzvMdG: instruction spent from the balance of an account it does not own
```
So I tried verifying that I actually own the program before transferring funds:
```rust
msg!(&format!(
  "topping up user wallet {} with {} lamports",
  wallet_acc.key, topup_amount
));

msg!(&format!(
  "wallet balance: {}, faucet balance {}",
  wallet_acc.lamports(),
  faucet_acc.lamports()
));
msg!(&format!(
  "wallet addr: {}, faucet addr {}",
  wallet_acc.key, faucet_acc.key
));
msg!(&format!(
  "wallet owner: {}, faucet owner {}",
  wallet_acc.owner, faucet_acc.owner
));
```
and everything seems fine:
```

Does anyone know how to fix this in VSCode by setting the PATH for solana env variable?
pls help
tyvm for helping find the path at least. I hate command line. Probably a lil more than I hate RUST
sorry, not the Win guru that probably knows the simple way to get there üôÇ
It's where I would start
you mean setting path variable in vscode terminal? Is that what I should be googling
yessir! I basically need the windows equivalent to this: https://youtu.be/35RO0lAEIxE?t=1877 at this time stamp he's doing it on mac
<@!711624019853574175> so perhaps there is a vscode for setting the terminal to inherit from within? Not a windows current user but Solana appears installed correctly
hi guys! i have a question, can i make a csv file, like 'id - token' for each token of nft collection?
It is
I think this is the path above
does it help?
ok I think this bit helped. See this:
``` C:\Users\Zubin\.local\share\solana\install\active_release\bin; ```
hello, how can I transfer tokens from a program owned token account? 
Currently it appears to need the program's sign to finish the transfer
And when you type 'PATH' in that terminal? Do you see the path where the solana binaries are located?
Should I download and copy paste the prebuilt binaries in m,y project folder? And then try?
I installed using windows CMD. Not powershell. And Im trying to run it from VSCode's terminal
So my admin CMD terminal opens in this: 
But when I search in this folder I cant find any solana files
Also, is the terminal in code CMD or Powershell?
right, but where is the resulting `solana`, `solana-test-validator`, `solana-keygen`, etc. etc. location?
this is what I did to install it
this is what I had.
C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe v1.8.2
from your 'code' terminal?
Right, what is the path to the solana.exe?
I assumed it will install globally like yarn does
which path? In the VSCode terminal I am in my project folder. And I had installed solana as admin in default C: folder
Does the path reflect the location?
Windows 10 pro
Can anyone help??????

Yes, well still sad to run Rosetta 2 for Solana, but even so it's vrutally quick and cool
i hope the m1 is screaming and worth it
No it wasn't, both PC. I build from sources though.

I pulled ~~main~~ master (UR NOT PC, BRO) and rebuilt, now working. So something must have been off, or HK internet temporarily was out idk. Thanks for your timely answers as always ‚ù§Ô∏è
if you check this transaction you will understand what i'm trying to say here

in it i create an NFT using my custom program and in each instrcution the token or the account created along with it has been assigned the program ID of token program, if now i want to get the tokens that were minted through my program wouldn't be possible using getProgramAccount method.
when i create a new account to become a mint of an SPL token, i alot 82 bytes as space -- is this enough? Is there a better way to compute the space needed?
dev is working for me.  can u try a diff network? or rpc?
Hay how do I upalod metaplex candymachine NFt assets to arweave from devnet and use same links for mainnet?

Someone told.me.its possible and potentially o can save much on SOLs required to uplaod files on the main net
Or maybe devnet got updated
I've been working 14h a days for 5 weeks without issue, like litteraly now <:laugh:843950745656754257>

Hey Everyone, I'm working on a project like this-  https://nfteyez.global/ but ain't able to call the required functions and fetch nft on the frontend.
What would you do to get nfts on the frontend in this way?
hmm..   what about the CLI matching the version..  are you running prebuilt binaries, build from source?   and what currently version?
M1pro
it may be something related to network, privacy, firewall, etc with the new mac?    is it the new m1max?
im not getting it.    when you mint a token, you specify the address your minting to.  if that user already has a token account, and you using the wallets address, that would potentially be trying to mint to an associated address, so you could try looking up the associated token address for the wallet -
ATA program adresses have a canonical format for that purpose (AssociatedTokenProgram)
Program don't return data. You need to derive the Adress before hand (even uninit) and pass them to the program, in the program you will then create the account then init it using the ATA program
I have two computer in front of me and the other work, spooky! Could it me the new macbook? <:thinkingpepe:746135853386039376>
Yes I can run a test validator, but I need devnet/mainnet for deployment today üòì
the payer wallet is the reciever and the owner of the token.... i'm interested in getting the token and token accounts that were created through CPI from my program...
hmm can you run a local vailidator, or try test net?  only other thing I can think of is some kind of a proxy, lan, firewall, or network routing issue ?   you dont get a timeout or failed connection related msg tho only a method not found?  is odd..
You can specify the output wallet. So you can pass parameter to your program. You can also create accounts using CPI and then transfer ownership to the caller
solana config output seems fine?
when minting a token it of course goes to the wallet address and also the token and it's account would belong to the token program i believe. if that's the case how can i get those token that were minted through my contract because I cannot use getProgramAccounts rpc method for my programId since it doesn't create any accounts itself

i can get the transactions for my program but that doesn't provide everything that is needed since it would only return a 1000 transaction....
Nop same
solana config get  ,  if your using the cli and that network to send request..
can you run any cli calls?  what about an airdrop
Not sure how to check the adress, I just typed solana ping
ping gave the same output?   thats usually related to a method not found - wrong server, unavailable call..  of some sort..   hmm  whats the address?
My `solana config get` seems proper with the devnet env
Deploy, but also `solana ping` give same output
I just did a fresh install on my mac m1pro (before had a m1, so I already know the x86 tricks)
when did you get that error? doing what
I'm on devnet, trying to use anchor, even `solana ping` doesn't work. Solana 1.8.2 and 1.7.7 (tried with both)
Setting up a new compuer and solana, I have this error `Error: RPC response error -32601: Method not found `

I've checked history but didn't find a clear troubleshooting
when you mint a token you should already know where your minting it to..   ?
Hello everyone, i think i asked this question before but didn't get any answer for it. the question was when a token is minted through my custom contract by cross invocation of the token program. is there any way to get those token and token accounts that were created through the custom program?
is that the project serum wallet adapter?
look at the CLI options for keygen grind
is there anyways to get like a special address? where the first 4 digits of the address spell a word or something? i know pesky penguins address is like pEsky or something i heard. there a way to do that
Does it mean after "1 sec" It will create a number of hashes, right ?
Hey all, I am using the sol-wallet-adapter program to sign messages, then [attempting] to verify them using `nacl.sign.detached.verify(msg Uint8Array, signature Uint8Array, publicKey Uint8Array)` method. This verify method only takes 64 bytes of data on the signature, though, and the message signing ritual in the wallet adaptor program produces an array of about 128 bytes; causes `error: bad signature size` when passed to nacl...verify(). Can anybody help me out, getting verify to work? thanks
ty ill try it
cats outta the bag
do 8 whoppa. get your 20b.
less
so more decimals or less if i want 20bil exactly
haha yes. üê∞
nice. üé©
FYI token supply is stored in u64. in the other words
your total supply should less or equals then u64 max or you got overflow error
`supply * 10^decimal <= u64's max (approx, 1.84e19)`
thats part of the experiment üôÇ
it may indicate why more tokens have less decimals 9 than more ü§∑
if it's a precision issue wouldn't you have to use less decimal places?
try it out on a local validator or dev and see üôÇ but sounds like that will give you enough places. what tokens are you pointing at?
i want to get 20bill tokens exactly do i have to change the decimal to 10 to do that
its up to you?  but 9 is pretty standard. generally there is a reason for going more or less. but depends on your goals.  if your doing it with cli you can use the decimals flag
yeah i do should it be 10?
look at your decimal place? you probably have it at 9?
sampling is where you take a sub-set of all the actual data... so if a slot contained 200 sequential hashes but you only "sampled" 100, you would get every other one. The same rule applies though... the validator can check it 100x faster than it took to generate all 100 values, it's just more steps on each sample-pair.
how do some coins have tril supply
its probably the max big int size üôÇ
What do "sample" and "sampling 100 values per slot" mean ? I just want to understand every pieces of information in that paragraph. Thank you
https://solscan.io/token/ERD6RgGEFoB8RmSGWve3iZjgRPzmRftWSbHJ3JXnXnUR
It means if I want to generate 100 sequential hashes, I have to take some time to do it, because I need the output of the first in order to generate the next one... but if I supply all 100 values it can be validated much faster because 100 parallel processes can take each adjacent pair and validate that the next one is indeed generated from the first... this validating in 100th the time it took to generate.
when i did this on testnet earlier it sent exactly what i said to mint. but now on devnet it didnt give me exactly 20bil like i put
i created a wallet on mainnet and created tokens and sent it to my wallet

Could everyone explain me that, please ? I spent multiple of hours on that but I haven't got it
not an answer... trying to understand/learn: You can create your own tokens and just mint them willy-nilly? Is that a thing?
how did you do this? üôÇ
you can open an issue with metaplex, and or see how the eco system feels, but metaplex meta data is separate from the token list meta data as far as I know and they are separately maintained and updated, and how each is read and interpreted by any scanner or explorer is up to that app.  will be interesting to see what unfolds..  as of now it seems the view in the explorers is being updated, as may tend to be the case over time for it to improve. it seems the others may copy, fork, or use explorer and thus the duplicated logic.
this is on mainnet btw ^
I minted 20bil spl tokens to my cli wallet but only 18billion got sent to my wallet?
Though in this case the NFT creator has maliciously published metadata to hijack the main info page for our SPL token with the same symbol.
I do think the fix needs to be addressed at the API level. You need to think about the use case where an SPL token (non-NFT) and SPL token (NFT) have the same symbol. The data for displaying should give priority to SPL tokens that are not NFTs.
Hi <@!785084693023424542> - issue with SDOGE token SPL showing as NFT due to metadata with same symbol name was fixed earlier by Josh in the Solana Explorer. Looks like it has been reverted. https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/commit/9ff561134dcee9a6f538dee4a64fc707daabfb15
the PR is for the token list, and you can specify the network/chain in that PR.  otherwise yes you create the token
the program likely needs to have the functionality to write the data. and you would have to have some kind of authority over the account, and the program would have to be the owner of the account. here is an example of a program that can read and write data to and from a program:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/record/program

Hi Friends. Any idea how I can transfer some lamports from the user account to PDA using rust. I can transffer tokens but not sure how I can transfer lamports
sorry if i was confusing, not looking to load this info from an rpc call but retrieve it from a program

Hello! I'm looking for the steps and guide to creating a new token. Here's the steps that I think are needed, but not sure how to do this first in devnet:
create token on mainnet using cli
open pr to add logo to assets/mainnet
open pr to add token to solana.tokenlist.json
it depends on how you want to go about doing it and what you want to analyze, but here are web3 methods you can call:
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getTokenAccountsByOwner
JSON RPC:
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api
Explorers:
https://explorer.solana.com/
For anything more you probably want to have some requirements.
basically you can derive an address for a specific program, and can use that address as a signer for the account referenced for that address, inside the program:
there are a few explainers, this may help:

Hi there, gm/gn. Would you have recommendations on how to start analyzing Solana on-chain data?
hm if I create a pda, is the program automatically the owner and only the owner can modify the data in the account?
yea that would be great. a getting started or how to and what to expect.
Got it, thanks a lot for you clarification.
it can take up to two weeks for the merge itself.  after it is merged, it may vary how often each explorer updates their feeds, if not soon after, based on implementation. either way all you can do is wait üôÇ
nice
We've started indexing program-level data, querying should be generally available in < 48 Hours. Maybe I can drop a video short video on how the queries may look like?
Thanks for the mention!
you mean after I merged my change to main branch, I have to wait for 2 week for the information update on https://explorer.solana.com/. Correct?
10MiB
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/system_instruction.rs#L137-L138
it takes up to 2 weeks to auto merge
Do you know how long does it take ? 1 - 2 day?
probably just gotta wait
Hi guy, I would like to ask about listing token on https://explorer.solana.com/, I have finished minting my token and it was no  https://explorer.solana.com/ already.

I would like to add the name of my token and also picture. So, I updated the token-list.json and get merged to main branch. But, when I checked on the website, it still does not show my token name and picture. 

Could you please suggest?
is there a limit for how much data an account can hold and how big is it?
thank you!
https://github.com/near/borsh-rs

I guess strings are some kind of variable length datatype in rust, so if thats the case these examples should suffice
hm i was going to do it without borsh first to get some feeling for whats going on under the hood but if thats just complete standard maybe i should move on
use borsh serialize/deserialize can make you more focus on your program.
if thats the case, thank you!
you think metaplex would serve as a code example for what im trying to do?
I think you can use Borsh to deal with data packing
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/rust/token-metadata/program/src/state.rs#L72-L83
metaplex use it a lot. you can take a look.
I think my problem is that Pack requires LEN
do you just store a vector and build appropriate de/serializers?
I know how to store data of static length, like a number
whats up guys

I am new to solana. I'm trying to store a variable length array of data on-chain. Lets say it was a sequence of orders of some sort or a registry. What's the best way to do this?
I just did an nft if you need help
you just trynna deploy an nft?
sollet also has it
which means Android/iOS cannot access devnet tokens?
Hi i created my nft and SPL token, just trying to figure out how to get it to show the name on phantom. im looking at the tokenlist on github is there anyway for it to work right away or do i have to wait 2 weeks

and when you click on it, its name is #102.
But they‚Äôre tracked as their token addresses, wish it was their names instead ü§£
Yeah sorry I don‚Äôt think I said exactly. I‚Äôm trying to track transactions for specific nfts, selling buying on certain marketplaces
metadata has the nft names
This code will go from public key -> nft metadata https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/get-account-nfts/getAccountNFTs.ts
You could just start from the mints instead
What would be the easiest way to get the name of a spl token (nft) from solscan/explorer if the solscan url is provided programmatically
Yea its still breaking
each keypair would have an associated public key
if you went through the docs in the link,  it covers what these things are, and how to create and use them
the solana-keygen command above  can create keypair files.   depending on what you intend to do with them. is what matters.
which one is the id.json?
whichever one you want..  but the default one used by the CLI is the id.json
id.json is the default one.  if you specify a new name it will create another keypair with another name.
how do i know which one is the main one to use
you can create new keypairs with keygen command

i did im just confused on why i have 2 pubkeys
I would go through this:
https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide
and even this for Tokens related to CLI if you have not yet:
https://spl.solana.com/token
sorry im new and im really just trying to understand my way around creating wallets in the cli . so im trying to understand the difference between the two commands, because they both create a keypair and the docs dont explain the difference or witch one to use it unless im missing something
all the code should be available to do that from what I recall.  I would first search for, and look through the resources, and ask very specific questions in metaplex discord. Others have made JS in addition to metaplex, and there are CLI methods as well.
Thanks, I really appreciate your help.  A lot of the NFT minting seems to be in python or rust, the js SDK: https://github.com/metaplex/js seems to be still under development. I guess I'll have to wait until they get further along?  My goal is to integrate minting into an existing site rather than a wholesale solution like storefront or candymachine.
is this in an example or demo? whats the issue or what are you actually trying to do?
so its a new add. not an update.  you should be able to submit yours as an add only and make sure not to delete anything. especially if its not an edit.

they each created different files
I am forking the current repo
whats the difference between the keypair created from ```solana-keygen new -o /Users/joey/config.solana/devnet-test.json``` and the keypair created by ```mkdir ~/my-solana-wallet
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/my-solana-wallet/my-keypair.json```
are you updating a previous addition or adding a completely new one?  
and when comparing locally the merge with master are there any conflicts?
if the answer is yes to either then you may want put comments in your PR to let them know of the merge conflict. Also,  auto merge and conflict resolution can currently take up to 2 weeks.
Otherwise, I believe there is an initiative to try and stream line this process.
It is the standard way to do NFTs. Heres a short NFT and Metadatalist of resources aside from the dev docs: There are libs in js and python for various things as well. you should be able to find what your looking for.

Yea it keeps on adding a deletion to the PR that i didnt do
so all NFT's are via metaplex? is there a way to generate these NFT's via a js SDK? similar to how you can with spl-token?
merge conflict?
its not for every NFT, this is for SPL-Token token standard.  For NFTs it follows the Metaplex Standard.
My PR to add my token keeps on failing
the keypair path used is located in the config.    the config.   however, some programs may try to use the default location. so you could always back up your keypairs, and cp/mv/rename a new one to id.json to use a different keypair for CLI or programs, as needed.
so i just noticed that a config.solana dir was created on my computer
if you make another keypair, and in another directory with a different name the CLI will not use that just because it is created.  But to get the address of the other keypair,  you use something like  `solana address -k <keypair>`
by default it will use only the 1 keypair file for CLI commands, located at the default location.  ./config/solana  id.json
Config File: /Users/joey/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com 
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: /Users/joey/config.solana/devnet-test.json 
Commitment: confirmed
is there a way to delete it and start over?
what do you see when you do solana config get ?  where is the file located?
yeah i tried that too and ill do `solana address` and its the same one from before
Anyone knows a way to add some randomisation to signatures, i was thinking in using the memo program to change in a unique way but thats no longer an option as we would like to use the memo as is supposed to be used for.
Currently i have the problem that when you create 2 transactions with the same data, the signatures is the same.
but be careful and backup if you need to first..
the keypair is different but the address is the same? hmm. what if you write --force or what if you use a different out name?
how is this handled on metaplex? do they do it differently? it seems odd that i would need to create a PR to mint every single NFT.
it makes a new keypair but it doesnt make a new address for some reason
to officially associate you need to fill out a PR here:
https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list

otherwise for testing only or preview you can modify the phantom wallet meta data for your wallet to update the name and symbol
what os are you on, and did you install rust, update os dependencies, and install solana cli per the install directions?
as i recall, if its with the same file, it may overwrite, unless you write --force. id test it on a dummy keypair to dbl check before anything real.
hi, i am able to mint a token with solana/web3 in js but it shows up as "Unknown Token" in my phantom wallet, how do I associate metadata with it so that it shows up as an NFT with an image?
```bash
error: no such subcommand: `+bpf`
```
Any one already faced this issue building the rust contract
I have a question what happens when i run ```mkdir ~/my-solana-wallet
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/my-solana-wallet/my-keypair.json``` more than once? does it get overwrited?
üòÑ
haha.   metalstep üî•

thanks!
closed the issue on github
all good now. Works, after adding `AccountMeta::new_readonly(spl_associated_token_account::id(), false)`
how are you adding it to program test?  
..oh, is it working now?
oh, sorry, I was not including it in the accounts list when invoking the transaction. Sorry for that!
I'm getting this in the test logs:
```
DEBUG solana_runtime::message_processor] Unknown program ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL
```
What accounts are you providing for signing?
If you have the mint account, you can do the first result. Otherwise you'll have to use the second example
have you seen the usage here:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/associated-token-account/program/tests/program_test.rs
and if you look at program_test:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/program-test/src/programs.rs#L16
It works
nope, works for me
Solana.com and docs.solana down??
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/21122 I created an issue for this
Thanks for this reference Jacob. I'm trying a call to this code snippet but I'm running into a "Error: Signature verification failed" at the sendRawTransaction step. Was wondering if you had any tips on how to debug this:

Regarding the parameters:
tokenMint: double checked it
wallet: grabbed it by generating a keypair from the base58decoded private key
to: public key of destination address
connection: verified its pointing at mainnet-beta explorer
amount: 1
Hey <@758357755899281469> , happy to connect; sending you a DM
Thanks, that worked, was using the wrong decoding
Try `let keypair = web3.Keypair.fromSecretKey(bs58.decode(phantomExportedKeyString));`
Does anyone know how to convert a private key (exported from Phantom wallet) into a secret key that can be used to initialize a Keypair (from web3.js lib)? I've tried encoding it with TextEncoder to convert it to the expected UInt8Array type but I'm getting "Error: bad secret key size"
Thanks a lot. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.
No actual damage. Just a bug on the explorer
Thanks. So nothing to worry about I guess? It looks really scary.
There seems to be some collision issues with NFT names and token names going on in the explorer. It's not an issue on chain, just with viewing on the explorer. It has been raised and being looked into
In fact it is a token with revoked mint authority and a fix supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens
The SCODE token has absolutely nothing to do with Metaplex, but the explorer says it is a Metaplex NFT.
Only the transaction 7 days ago were done by me
https://explorer.solana.com/address/HWnfNCDHWJqqXQBpF379ubyLPhk8sdvFAa2mBsn4T6Bz/instructions
I have the same problem as Wim#3080 menioned: my token has been messed with with some Metaplex metadata 2 days ago:
I may be wrong, but I do not see any jsonrpc call for that.
I've dumped the program and saved it to `tests/fixtures` as `spl_ata.so`, then I'm doing:
```rust
program_test.add_program(
  "spl_ata",
  Pubkey::from_str("ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL")?,
  processor!(spl_associated_token_account::processor::process_instruction),
);
```
and it's still not picking it up and failing with `DEBUG solana_runtime::message_processor] Unknown program ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL`
I also tried adding:
```rust
program_test.prefer_bpf(false);
```
And nothing. Is there a way I can use it in unit tests? The only (and the nastiest, that I'd really rather avoid) solution that I see now, if nothing works, is just copying the contents of the process function from `spl-associated-token-account` into my program. I really need to have my code testable with unit tests.

Is there a way to transfer NFT's using the solana cli?
so it's not a standalone validator that I can deploy to
I'm running it in `cargo test-bpd`
You can use `solana program dump` to get the related `.so` for local deployment
Could you deploy it before running the tests in your CI?
Gotcha. Thanks for clarifying!
Hello, the `ProgramTest` test validator seems to be missing the associated-token-account program, and in my unit tests I'm getting `Unknown program ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL`. Is there a way to deploy the associated-token-account program first before running my test?
Correct. Per token, there is one token account. These are associated token accounts.
Naive question then..how does it know which token to send? I don't see it in the transfer instructions. Is it because the token account is always linked to a specific single token so it's not ambiguous?
using `splToken.Token` from `const splToken = require('@solana/spl-token');`
I don't believe it is transferring sol. It's transferring a token from different token accounts
Thanks Jacob! The transfer seems like it's transferring SOL but not a specific token/NFT? On L53
There's a second example here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68236211/how-to-transfer-custom-token-by-solana-web3-js/69522224#69522224
Here's an example: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/examples/create_mint_and_transfer_tokens.js
This shows how it's done on the command line, but I didn't see any equivalents in the npm lib
Hey all, new to the discord, great to be here. Was wondering if anyone here knew how to programmatically transfer NFTs from a wallet to another?

That worked, thank you!
What about using `getBlockTime`?
I just tried that and I'm getting "Null" for the blockTime associated with the given slot.

yea, that's what I figured. I just was wondering if anyone has forked the spl-token program yet to add these 'game theory' components. Obviously it woudn't work with stardard Serum markets, but if you were willing to build your own dex/amm program that used the custom spl-token account.... will probably see it in a matter of time
Hey! anyone run into the issue when you type 'cargo build-bpf' it says 'Error during execution of `cargo metadata`: error: could not find `Cargo.toml` in...'
Are you actually getting 429?
Maybe you're running into something else, but devnet is definitely up.

üò¶
its been a whole night since ive made a tx
Your http statuses usually start being 429
how do i tell this?
Every associated token account is owned by the parent account, or usually what you use for SOL. Associated token accounts are really just PDAs off of the token program
i see

Hey guys i'm trying to implement the swap inside the solana chain just for learning anyone has any sample or link to share about it?
Dear, <@!489206164270350337>  could you please tell me about relationship  between owner with token account the below picture
I am not sure. Would need more information
yeah ill try and look further
gotcha 
to clarify the lamport transfer to the token account is irrelevant to listing price correct ?
It may be handled differently per marketplace. DigitalEyes or MagicEden may be handling as part of data stored in accounts
yah so I identified it for solanart alphaart but it seems for some it‚Äôs not even available in the program output
You'd have to decode the program output for listings. Depends on how each marketplace is doing listings
yeah , Even the base64 encoded account info data section seems not to contain it
Probably not. You could always see that transferred amount, or decode whatever the listing was to figure out how much a token is listed at
it‚Äôs starting to seem like no . any feedback is Much appreciated
I don't believe it will work like that. Smart contracts for tokens in EVM world =/= token program. The tokens are minted to an account, and managed there. You'd have to create a separate standard, or wait for evm support
is there another way - for marketplaces that don‚Äôt explicitly say the list price in any rpc response - to find the listing price of a given nft via the rpc
Hey all, this question came up and I realized I don't really know the answer. Lots of EVM projects use these mint/burn on transfer() gimmicks, and I don't know if any projects are using non-spl-tokens or if there's a way to build a program that would override the spl-token transfer functionality:
During that transaction, those are the currently owned accounts
So you mean, is  the account owned the token at any given time?
lovely, taking a look. thank you !
It's just showing all accounts owned at any given time
I was thinking we don't really have a channel for general Python Solana stuff anywhere ü§î  though we do have the AnchorPy channel at least https://discord.gg/fF5Ru5hB

is there a place where I can discuss about python api for solana?
What exactly are you asking here? The transaction you posted had no changes on `5RJHbiaHvnRcLQs7S6xmHYC8nfAuXVt8PwGGrjRCaF6Z`
It looks like the account `5RJHbiaHvnRcLQs7S6xmHYC8nfAuXVt8PwGGrjRCaF6Z` didn't have any debits or credits to it in this transaction
maybe I can set some limit
I don't know actually, I'll inspect the python api before anything
Do you know if you're getting 429 statuses? You may be hitting rate limits
So, I don't know if that's the reason I'm getting blocked
Actually, I'm coding a program to make successive requests
Yes, sometimes it works

I think NFT collections and SPL tokens should not have the same symbols. And if so, the Explorer should prioritise the info for the token, not aggregate with data from the NFT.

Could someone help me?
but it isn't connecting
I'm trying to access solana API mainnet
Please see attached API response on Explorer.
It is on both
If with solscan, you should reach out to them with the bug
Is it only with the solscan explorer, or also explorer.solana.com?
I'm speaking to them, but I have a feeling they might send me back to you. First of all, should it be possible for an NFT project to publish with a symbol that already exists as an SPL token?
Looking for someone that could help me create a smart contract to sell SPL-tokens at a certain price
have you filed an issue yet?  with metaplex?
Can you expedite this please as it is very likely this is a vulnerability for all SPL tokens that could be messed up in this way in the Explorer.
<@!785084693023424542> - we won't be able to reproduce this as it relies on the symbol in the SPL token list.
Getting the transactions processed at each marketplace
You could do something like what I explained here https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/904795432394309652

im new to solana - im a data scientist - i cant seem to find much on this online
The hello world program just is a counter for the amount of times "hello" is sent to the program. It is mainly just as a tutorial. You could make UX to show the amount of times it was greeted by each account if you wished
Hi Solana friends.
I am currently attempting to determine the price of a given token via the solana RPC. With Solanart and Alphaart, it was simple enough as for solanart, the price data can be found in the 'meta' section of the get_confirmed_signature_for_address2 rpc response, and for alphaart, within the get_confirmed_transaction response.
But I need to find this data for digitaleyes, magiceden, and more - but I'm not sure where it'd be best to proceed with this. I've scoured the responses of rpc calls on tokens belonging to these marketplaces but I see no indicator of price.

My idea was maybe find it through arithmetic on the pre/post balance arrays but I didn't get an accurate result attempting to do so. 

Any thoughts? Thank you all so much.
Ok so correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. 

Let‚Äôs say I built hello world on mainnet with a beautiful UI/UX. Every transaction the user sends to the account would feed a message ‚Äú any message I want ‚Äú back to them ?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The data of a Solana Program is compiled BPF. There are BPF disassemblers but that will leave you with BPF Assembler source only. If you can read that, great. I know of no tools that will translate that to the original Rust source

It didn't work because you exceeded 200_000 execution units?

This is exactly how I did when I was contracted for HOAG
Think I found the answer Collab.land
I see. Thank you
If you structure the bot well you could even setup a project system so that other project could use your solution! üòâ
I think setting up a bot to do that would be the best, code the discord bot to:
a: connect with a discord user, 
b: connect their wallet to the bot and link the two (via a web ui), 
c: scan their token list for your nft, 
d: assign a role based on if they have the nft, have a certain number of the nft (whale) etc

Hello everyone. 
So the last time i was here i was trying to serialize and derserialize a struct having a vector of publickeys. now that i have done it.
Now i want to know how can i create an account on solana blockchain so i can let it know that it has to store like 10000 public Keys? i tried to create an account with the size having 50 pubkeys but it didn't work any ideas on how to go about it?
is it possible to see the RUST contract of Solana , on https://solscan.io/ ?
guys I haven't managed to find any info/doc on creating a PoS coin on Solana, and then creating a Staking Pool for this coin? anybody aware please? thanks in advance
do they still update the ecosystem website?
Think of them like an 'abstract interface' where you need to implement the functions for. It is there for a consistent interface that your program relies on. You don't have to use them to serialize or deserialze account data. Instead you can just 
```rust
let mut account_data = program_account.data.borrow_mut();
// That statement is what is the equivalent of dereferencing the pointer to the data storage of an account.
```
And do your deserialze
You could then serialize the changes you may make to the data to update the accounts data state
Thank you! I'll try to figure it out
Thank you for the explanation. Appreciate it. Just curious, why is there a need to use `unpack` or `pack`? Is it similar to dereferencing a pointer in other languages like C++?
Sealed, Pack and IsInitialized are Rust traits. You implement these if you want to use `unpack_unchecked`, `unpack` and `pack` in your program.

For example. usage implies that that you somehow indicate that the data storage for an account needs to be initialized. At first access to an accounts data, it is common to `unpack_unchecked` so the Pack trait implementation won't fail as it calls `is_initialized` first:
```rust
fn initialize_account(accounts: &[AccountInfo]) -> ProgramResult {
    msg!("Initialize account");
    let account_info_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let program_account = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
    let mut account_data = program_account.data.borrow_mut();
    // Just using unpack will check to see if initialized and will
    // fail if not
    let mut account_state = ProgramAccountState::unpack_unchecked(&account_data)?;
    // Where this is a logic error in trying to initialize the same
    // account more than once
    if account_state.is_initialized() {
        return Err(SampleError::AlreadyInitializedState.into());
    } else {
        account_state.set_initialized();
    }
    ProgramAccountState::pack(account_state, &mut account_data).unwrap();
    Ok(())
}
```
After initialization, you would use: `let mut account_state = ProgramAccountState::unpack(&account_data)?;`
Here is an example setup of implementations using these traits: https://github.com/hashblock/solana-cli-program-template/blob/main/program/src/account_state.rs
hi, how to create mint keypair from seeds, i meaning deterministic mint address which can derive by the seeds in the future?
the basic gist is to get the account info and then borshdecode it 
in javascript there is now a js package that you can use https://gist.github.com/dvcrn/a1b0ff0a0b4b3ab02aff44bc84ac4522

There is a older gist that explains how to manually decode the account without the js package: https://gist.github.com/dvcrn/c099c9b5a095ffe4ddb6481c22cde5f4
that gives me the token's address, how to get the metadata using  that?
i get the list of signatures, then parse the tx to get the postToken balances
I'm using python
do you want it within a onchain program or within javascript
which methods do i need to use
Is this doable using web requests with the RPC?
you have to retrieve the metadataaccount from metadata program, then borsh deserialize that. For onchain, pass the account to the metadata account into your program
it's gone
Can someone explain to me what does `program_pack` do? What does `Pack` and `Sealed` mean?

```rust
use solana_program::{
    program_pack::{ IsInitialized, Pack, Sealed },
    pubkey::Pubkey
}
```
what if mango relies to the logs to be correct. That can break their offchain stuff
I can add that to a program and do the same too.
Ohhh now I see. Thank you!

<@!788215642070581289>Hello, Is the method getParsedConfirmedTransactions still there? When i call it the json returns  'method not found', I'd like to get transactions without having to parse each transaction individually
Hi there! i hope you re doing well,  i need help to creating your own solana pool on market ??  Anyone can help???
guys I haven't managed to find any info/doc on creating a PoS coin on Solana, and then creating a Staking Pool for this coin? anybody aware please? thanks in advance
okay got it
i know the command on mac is cmd shift g
But ive created a wallet using the solana code on vscode. I need ti get my new keypair but am not sure how to find the path to access my keypair
hey guys. I know this may sound dumb but I'm new to working on windows and wsl.
thanks pal
you can use the method 1
https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/advanced/token/get-all-token-account-by-owner.html
you also need to check initializer is a signer.
I have no idea with `soster`. candymachine is a good start to you I think.
Hello folks, may I ask is there any api that could query all spl tokens hold by one owner? Seems GetTokenAccountByOwner need to fill in the mint addresses
Okay thank you so much. I'm still new to rust so would it look something like this?

```rust
let account_info_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
let initializer = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;

if initializer.address == "0x13hkj12h3k12" {
  // Able to execute admin actions
}
```
Is it ok to launch the nft on soster or i should do that in candymachine
1. you can create an account to store these whitelist pubkey and only your admin can update this list (for the admin, you have to hardcode the admin's pubkey in your program)

or

2. you can just hardcode the whitelist in your program

the structure looks good to me.
for NFT: https://docs.metaplex.com/
```javascript
lib.rs           -> Handles registering of modules
entrypoint.rs    -> Handles the entrypoint
instruction.rs   -> Handles program API and de(serializing) of data
processor.rs     -> Handles program logic
state.rs         -> Handles states
error.rs         -> Handles errors
```
also, is this the correct way to structure our smart contract?
How do we whitelist address in a smart contract so that only they can perform a certain action?
Where should i launch that nft and how should i be doing for future progression
Hello guys 
I wanted to get your help on what should i be doing to launch my nft art which can be used in a dapp (game) tht i‚Äôm creating in solana blockchain
Your first constraint is that the total transaction size in bytes and will fail transmission if greater than 1232 bytes
So calculate that sum of instructions, where each 'instruction' size is the sum of each account (figure 32 bytes each) and the instruction data block
https://docs.solana.com/proposals/transactions-v2#problem
how can I get USDC on the devnet to test it?
is there anyway to sort this JSON RPC request by recently created? currently it just gives me program accounts with no order it seems, also am I doing something wrong with the "limit" param? 
```
curl http://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "getProgramAccounts",

    {
      "limit": 5,
      "encoding": "jsonParsed"
    }
  ]
}' --silent | jq -r '.result[]'
```
How many instructions can I fit in a transaction? Is there any number limit or only have to ensure they don't overcome the computation limits?
I am still a bit confused on the definition of `crank` . Is `crank` just an externally accessible function?
Can someone help me with using fee_payer on a transaction? I am unsure what to sign?
Hello, my pull request is 22 days old, how long it takes to merge?
https://github.com/solana-labs/ecosystem/pull/640
your seed is already buffer so you can simplify that to:  `bip39.mnemonicToSeed(mnemonic).then(buffer => Keypair.fromSeed(Uint8Array.from(buffer.slice(0,32))))`
then check what you actually get and compare to real keypair data
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/21359 jon it is broken on my machine lol, i updated to 1.8.5
thank you
you're a lifesaver man
found it
solana config set --url https://api.mainnet.solana.com
but when i create new keypair, it wants me to overwrite
i need to create new mainnet wallet
how can i get out of devnet
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
I think you can take a look here https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/tour/create-keypair.html
which tool can i use to decode? theres nothing to look at the internet
any idea how do we get ourselves listed on the solana ecosystem. Weve already submitted our project for listing on the ecosystem and has been about 5 days or so
you can use this rpc https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getminimumbalanceforrentexemption
hello! I'm brand new to solana, just getting started working through the anchor tutorials and thinking of a first application to build... I'm wondering where I can find the current rent cost for data in an account?
you can take a look at how the keypair file is stored.
you will find that is just a array. This is the raw private key.
When you export a private from wallet I think it will be a formatted string (maybe base58)
So you need to do a decode to retrieve the raw private key and save it as a keypair file.
maybe you can dig into https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter
how can i export keypair file from 3rd party wallet?
into an object
how can unpack this? ``const result: Buffer | web3.ParsedAccountData``
thank you so much
for private key is true. if you export your seed, you have to use something like `solana-keygen recover` to retrieve your private key file first.
Is it possible to convert the public key returned after a wallet connection to a wallet address? trying to wrap my head around how the solana wallet-adapter works
or generally speaking, where can I get a user's wallet address to display in the UI after they connect their wallet
right?
and then solana config set -k <my-exported-private-key-file>
oh
sure. you can export your 3rd party wallet's seed or private key.
for creating token
can i create file system wallet with private key from 3rd party wallet?
you can use `solana config set -k <your-keypair-file-path>`
ive created 2 wallets, now i cant change it back to previous one
how can i change my solana file system wallet on CLI
hey guys
Same question here. Did you find a way?
this is for testing purposes, for the record
is there a straightforward way to upload dozens of kilobytes of data to an account? methinks it'd be too big for a single instruction
Thank you. Appreciate it
it depends on what kind of accounts/data your trying to deserialize and read, and between Solana github, Solana Program Library, and metaplex there are many examples. based on where your trying to do that it by default likely means that whatever your trying to 'parse' or deserialized, by default isnt able to be parsed, and may need to be deserialized unpacked or parse in some other way.  hard to say without seeing any code.
from the transaction response?  this is the description.
`Optional blockTime?: number | null
The unix timestamp of when the transaction was processed`

you could also check solana explorer, to see how they show time for transactions.

https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/governance
Hi, I'm trying to implement a voting system in a Smart Contract. Does anyone have a good resource that I can reference to?
Isn't blocktime how much time it took to create the block itself?
How can I deserialize account data
Hi all, I am using rust to test getaccountinfo and decode the data inside, I got ProgramNotParsable
I asked there before hehe, I'll try again, thanks!
https://discord.gg/metaplex  'im sure you know about this. but good luck with that question. not sure my self.
the payer needs to sign if cost is involved. but other signers can be included.
Hi there! I need a help with metaplex contracts. I'm creating an instant sale auction with a store which has `public = true` , but  `validate_safety_deposit_box_v2` is returning a error that the creator is not whitelisted, anyone know what I could do? I don't want to validade each creator... I'm testing it on devnet.
Here's an example of setting the `onlineAccount` as the payer and signing with the `offlineAccount` https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/offline-nonce-account/offlineNonceAccount.js#L80
You can set the `feePayer` to be a different wallet, and have multiple signers on the transaction
In Solana is it possible for the tx signer and fee payer to be different? For example, I build a tx, I want others to pay for it but need to keep the content of my tx unchanged.
Haven't seen this, but it looks like token-swap is using it https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/search?q=precise_number
didnt get help on my tech issue, but fished out a scammer <@&439193644826755093>
You can set up a cron job to hit the crank, or have an incentive for anyone to hit it
Mango prefixes all their logs with `mango-log` for their programs. Check it out https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/mango-v3/blob/0c4d26e3e32821d871c5e5986edafbf694a44137/mango-logs/src/lib.rs#L8
Is PreciseNumber the 'golden path' for doing any form of float like ops on uints in solana? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/21f8af34e7dac77ba60b1821a7d30ede53387fae/libraries/math/src/precise_number.rs#L28
Are permissionless cranks usually triggered manually by someone or they can also be triggered automatically like in some sort of schedule? Like a vesting contract for example. Thanks
there should be a way to know what program is calling the program log
how to go about this ?
Can DM?
Cool, ok, I was close. Problem was Rust telling me that I couldn't call `Clock::get` because the module where the trait is defined must also be in scope. I had to `use solana_program::sysvar::{clock::Clock, Sysvar}`
I'm still a bit rusty with Rust, but I believe the answer to your question is yes.
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/4fe3354c8f78cc140c71ea9897cd663ac33dde11/programs/bpf/rust/sysvar/src/lib.rs#L33
You can see an example usage of `Clock::get()` here. It is from `use solana_program:sysvar::clock::Clock`
In regards to getting the `unix_timestamp` at runtime, the docs say that you should "query the sysvar at runtime via `Clock::get()`. Could someone clarify where `Clock` is brought into scope? Do I need to `use solana_program::sysvar::clock::Clock;`?
Thanks!!!
Something like this https://github.com/skynetcapital/solanaj/blob/main/src/main/java/org/p2p/solanaj/token/TokenManager.java#L59
For getting token amount values based on token accounts, you could just use some of the other rpc methods.
So, if i can decode the data message, these values will probably be there? Correct?
I can see for example here that the solscan displays the tokens amount locked: https://solscan.io/account/6UmmUiYoBjSrhakAobJw8BvkmJtDVxaeBtbt7rxWo1mg
Yes, i am speaking of Raydium.
What do you mean pool's token value locked? Are you speaking of Raydium?
Because i want to get the pool's token value locked, is the data the correct field/place to look or i need to check to some other program? Based on your experience. Thanks
No problem. I'm a Java dev before this, so I know your pain
Thank you for the explanation <@!489206164270350337>
I want to be happy again! üòÜ
Nah I uploaded them but as you can see it looks wrong.
It's a different kind of developer friendly. Awaiting for when you can throw jackson-borsh at it and be happy again
If you find the serialization the program uses, you then know how to deserialize it
Shit, this is not very developer friendly
ok, so if i find the serialization algo that the X program uses then i can decode it using that info? Is that correct?
Unfortunately you can't just throw jackson at is and hope for the best
Type of serialization is a feature, so it's up to the program to choose
The data field that comes from the rpc getAccount call will be a different structure based on how the program is serializing the account
So because of that there isn't any universal decoder?
So i order to understand correctly. The base64 data response is a different structure for every call of the RPC? It has to do with what the response structure is?
Basically the structure is the `/model` dir has all the deserialization of various accounts for the programs. You can see how it grabs different parts of the data and reads it into an object
Yes, i am working on this repo now, but i haven't found anything yet
You can find other program examples of decoding with java here though https://github.com/skynetcapital/solanaj-programs
Raydium is a bit tricky since they're not completely open source
From a Raydium pool. Do you want the pubkey?
From what program?
Hello, i would like to decode base64 response data from RPC call. What i need to do in order to decode it? I am using Java language.
Here's Serum's guide https://docs.projectserum.com/guides/multisig
Sounds like a scam. Check metaplex though, as they have more people using NFTs https://discord.gg/metaplex
That's correct. I think mango changes the descriptors based on the program. If another program that you're calling has the same beginning though, you're out of luck
Can someone point me in the direction of information regarding the generation of a multi signature wallet?
how to verify if a program log really belongs to your program ? what if someone calls your program inside another program and emits an event that has a similar discriminator. 2 program logs would be emitted.
Thanks!
An example of this would be creating wrapped SOL. You would do something like this:
```
const solTransferTransaction = new Transaction()
  .add(
    SystemProgram.transfer({
        fromPubkey: wallet.publicKey,
        toPubkey: associatedTokenAccount,
        lamports: LAMPORTS_PER_SOL
      }),
      createSyncNativeInstruction(
        associatedTokenAccount
    )
  )
```
Where the SystemProgram is called for the transfer instruction, and the Token program is called for syncNative
Yes
can a transaction call 2 programs ? one program in each instruction
Nvm see you solved it
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69245982/import-phantom-wallet-private-key-into-solana-cli
thank you ser üôè
base58 worked
I have no idea.  Hex isn't generally useful here
Or maybe base64, depends on your request
oh wait so I need base58 -> hex?
That the "ascii" is base58
I'm struggling to arrive at the hex encoding of instruction data that Solana's explorer is showing.

Here's the tx - https://explorer.solana.com/tx/HKuQ2ejrY31DjmvgvZrURBbtRhQKodKnQFEP9uCLr7m3zKYeLFEHQSKLDRuoKB5U4AE6SEsin1xDDGC2U5Q2kf8

Explorer is showing - `050046c32300000000` (last instruction)
When I pull the tx down from the node I'm getting - `"data": "4h9HXdActS8X",`, which when I translate it to hex gets me `34 68 39 48 58 64 41 63 74 53 38 58` (according to this - https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-hex.html)

What am I missing?
thanks i resolved it 
with this code Keypair.fromSecretKey(bs58.decode("private"))
in web3, getTransaction should have results that has the blocktime the transaction was processed. https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#TransactionResponse
You are my hero!)
These sound like questions for Phantom
add it from NPM
Use bs58 to make it simpler

No idea what you're asking
can I get my pairs from the private key (phantom)?
That creates a raw ed25519 keypair.  You need to derive it from the `m/44'/501'/0'/0'` bip32 path.  Use `ed25519-hdkey` or w/e it's called
i was trying this, but when i am trying get balance i am getting null
bip39.mnemonicToSeed(mnemonic).then(buffer => Keypair.fromSeed(new Uint8Array(buffer.toJSON().data.slice(0,32))))
Hello guys, can you help me with getting keyPair from seed ? How can I get it from the seed phrase which I get from phantom ?
Hey guys, does anyone know how to get the datetime a transaction was confirmed? That is, its timestamp. Given either its block or signature. I tried to search in the API docs, but couldn't find. Has anyone a way of doing so?
There's a list of metadata assets that wallets/explorers/etc pull from.  They update when they update
Why does `spl-token create-token --output json` don't return the token address, just the signature ?
`let key = "<key as base58>".parse::<Pubkey>().unwrap();`
Thanks for the insight, I'll take a look.
How can transform an string address to an a Pubkey struct variable?
hi guys. Im trying to define a mocked publickey in rust to compare it with an input pubkey.
something like this `let mocked_pkey: Pubkey = Pubkey::new([...])` where `...` is in somehow, the translation of a human redeable account address, and then, do something like:
`if mocked_pkey != input.owner...`
is it ok, or I can do it the same with less code?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

anyone know when rust edition 2021 will be supported by solana?
I did get something with another address, but the address in above screenshot I cannot get the correct decode data after I call base64 decode
Hey is there a solana Rust programming API. I looked on search engines, but only JSONRPC API comes up.
base64 decode in whatever language you are working in
No I mean a deployed program <@814228493302497301>
`solana program -h`
Upgrade the program
So I searched the channel and found this kind of swap transaction : https://solana.surf/transaction/MbSx5cSrpNTUtXDRTXRkQPaegBPi4idGupnujQMUcc8NBriPByaHUaRtmUEseUMkPCNtZAkckpP5hbAu7FpAt6h 

It appears to be quite different from the New Account > Initialize > Swap > Deposit > Withdraw > Withdraw_one chain of instructions. Is it rather a New Account > Initialize > Approve > Swap > Close account chain of instructions ? Is there a universal chain of instructions producing a swap or does it change between exchanges programs (such as Saber, Orca...) ?
say I have a program that does some machine learning inference. I might want to modify the machine learning pipeline later on. How can I do that?
is it possible to change parts of a solana program later on?
Network down again ?
Yes, https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#cross-program-invocations
hi, is it possible to call another solana program from one solana program? If so, how do you do it?
Thanks! Updating!
I will look deeper another time and provide feedback via DM
In paragraph starting "If you know front-end development..." you don't mention TypeScript but in Section II you start using it for the example
In paragraph starting "If you know Rust..." I think you mean ***"If you don't know Rust..."***

hello can i ask how would i retrieve the list of nfts created from a candy machine and i already have the candy machine id. thanks!
people are getting scammed by people who are posing as "team members" and offering to "help people out" for a "rush listing fee", total nonsense
there's far too many people who are both spamming that list with tons of scam coins/things that have no business being listed as-is.  its becoming a bit of a problem, actually
gonna take a while for anything that gets submitted in that repo to have any attention paid to it, tbh
I‚Äôm already add my token, but i want to edit it
you probably are getting an error with the IDE or whatever text editor it is that you are using, seems to be a lot of people are getting formatting errors with spaces and stuff when they are adding PRs in that repo on github, if the comments are any indicator
lol i know someone who is already working on this very thing, actually. how strange.
Hey guys, a frontend dev here.

Anyone know about my question?
I think I will go with borsh, that seems like a common choice anyways.
You're choice
Yes
How to edit our token on solana github on token-list? I want to add some social media and website url in there
Is bincode really that inefficient for storing data?
Borsh or Bincode to store data in pda account controlled by program?
Just to clarity there are two aspects:
1. ***Transaction Instructions: ***When you are constructing a transaction it may contain 1 or more Instructions, each of which may represent a call to different programs. For example, it is a common practice to have the first instruction in the transaction create a program owned account and that goes to a System program, and the second instruction that Initializes the just created account and this is sent to the program that owns the account.
2. ***Program Instructions:*** The individual processing paths identified, typically, as an index into an Instruction enum,  that the program may execute.
Ok thank you, I'll look into it
maybe here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L240
Hi sir, btw what's the structure like the mint account's accountInfo that should decode into to extract the mint authority? Understand that the accountInfo has a function deserialize_data but I can't have any info how to decode the structure , appreciate if there is any example for this
`solana-keygen grind --help`
solana-keygen new --help didn't really provide info on that
`ARGS:
    <TOKEN_KEYPAIR>    Specify the token keypair. This may be a keypair file or the ASK keyword. [default: randomly
                       generated keypair]` Anybody knows how to create a token keypair (so a general new keypair) with custom words in the public address?
Oh ok, thanks a lot
perfect, thank you!
meta is derived by mint so first you need get the mint then
https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/advanced/metaplex/get-tokenmeta.html
mint authority is stored in the mint account. you can pass mint account into your instruction then decode its data to retrieve mint authority on chain.
thanks, this helped me out.  once you have the token addresses from a wallet does anyone know the best way to get the metadata?  I'm using i programs.metadata.Metadata.findByOwnerV2(connection, walletPublicKey); which takes an age, is there a quicker way?
Hi, anyway that I can check or verify the mint authority of an spl token from the Rust on chain?
Nope as far as i know. Instructions are a part of a program. A single program can have multiple instructions. And each of those would belong to that specific program instead of being a separate thing.
Hello. Want to verify. Is every instruction basically a separate program?
Cheers mate! got me started down the right track, downloaded react developer tools to see functions in the browser that pointed to an issue in the metadata. I have 3 creators listed in the metadata splitting profits, but had the same wallet listed for two different creators in the array ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

If I can ask you another question; I thought listing 3 wallets in the "creators" array would mean that payments would be split at the ratio defined, but I'm not seeing payments move to the three wallets specified as "creators". Am I wrong in thinking this is how I would do payment split? Seems like all payment is going to the treasury account. appreciate your help/patience, if you can point me somewhere I can read to learn on my own I'd appreciate it!
barely figuring out similar problems myself
I'm not the expert here
can you refer me to some proper documentation about seeds because as of yet i haven't had a clear understanding of it. 
and what could be a general use case for the signers to be program controlled... i'm sorry if this makes no senseüòÖ
that's for if none of the signers are program-controlled
it's fine.  since ```rust
pub fn invoke(instruction: &Instruction, account_infos: &[AccountInfo]) -> ProgramResult {
    invoke_signed(instruction, account_infos, &[])
}```
if you're calling invoke_signed, you should probably have some seeds in the last arg
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
```rust
invoke_signed(&assign(mint_token_account.key,my_program.key), &[mint_token_account.clone(),sys_program.clone()], &[])```
this is what i'm getting trying to assign the mint or the token account to my own program...
```failed to verify account F5hNeNgAw4tqZQveJYxHtAsm95T58cwZEcwbw3pVMMdj: instruction modified the program id of an account```
Does anyone have any idea why voting_account returns {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0} when trying to access `voting_data.data`?

```rust
let accounts_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
let voting_account = next_account_info(accounts_iter).ok().unwrap();
```
Okay let me check whether or not that work but i doubt it...
and mints should be *owned*, as far as the chain is concerned, by an instance of the `spl_token` program
"its token account" is unclear, though
I believe it's possible to have a program-controlled mint, sure
i have a general question about the tokens on the solana blockchain. Since we already know that tokens can only be generated by the token program and there is no other way. I'm thinking of creating a mint account, create it's token account and assign both of these accounts to my own custom program, would it work? or for a token the assigned program ID must be that of the token program?
I have specify encoding to jsonparsed but the response value is still base64 encoded. How can I decode this account.data?

have a question on the solana token list - made our update almost 2 weeks ago and I see this now - do I need to resubmit or edit the PR? doesnt look like it's merged in
Found the problem. For some reason, 

`My First Proposal` is returning a length of 11  when doing `let data_len = voting_account.data.borrow().len();`. Any idea why? Shouldn't it return a length of `17` instead?

```rust
fn process_add_proposal(_: &Pubkey, accounts: &[AccountInfo], name: Vec<u8>) {
    msg!("processAddProposal {:?}", std::str::from_utf8(&name));
    let accounts_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let voting_account = next_account_info(accounts_iter).ok().unwrap();
    let data_len = voting_account.data.borrow().len();

    msg!(
        "Voting account: {:?}, length: {:?}",
        voting_account.key,
        data_len
    );

    msg!(
        "Content {:?}",
        std::str::from_utf8(&voting_account.data.borrow())
    );
    write_data(voting_account, &name, 0);
}
```
Okay thank you
thats up to you. its doing its job.  but inside the program you can check the length and throw your own error or do your own preferred way of handling it. from the client side, you want to do your best to validate and prevent overflow from happening in the first place. erroring and or warning the client side first. to do this you will want to know the account size to begin with. this should be a known value, from your self, or trial and error.
My `input` length is 17 while my `account_data` length is 11. How do I ensure that when copying, it always meets the correct size without causing any error?
the guess would be the input being copied ends up going over the offset + len of what is being written to. current account data size is not big enough and/or the offset is too big, and runs out of bounds/overflow account data byte index.  try to use text in concise portions and or link to relevant code. makes it easier to search and others to read/copy.

Does anyone know why this is throwing an error?
wallet related error, that you may see when it detect when payer funds are not enough, but not sure about all the potential reasons. I would check verbose logs, you can run while this is running to see if you get any more information, and or add some logging to the program.  make sure there are enough funds. you also can check on explorers to see potentially trace and see whats going on.
I'm working on an nft minting site (candy machine/react/metaplex). I was able to get an initial build running on devnet, but ran into an issue where payouts weren't transferring to multiple creator wallets. I attempted to rebuild to address the issue, and now I can't complete a mint. When I initiate the mint, my wallet displays the error "transaction may fail to confirm" and the mint fails immediately. google-fu has failed me in resolving the issue, any idea why this is happening? TIA
Hi just want to do a pull request in https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pulls but I see automerge-error

Could someone help me?
you could more or less replicate this idea on Solana in some way, yes.  
you can integrate just about anything. its more about what you want to store on chain vs off chain, your use case, and if it makes sense. Are games being developed that are using Solana? yes. Is it necessary to store every single thing on chain?  generally no. depends on your requirements, design and situation.
hi all.  is this game possible on solana? https://www.wolf.game/whitepaper
yeah, makes sense. I was worrying that if I put the system instruction in the same transaction as an instruction to write to the account, there could be a race condition, but now I see that these are both write operations and, as you say, will occur sequentially
its really just a classic styled performance based setup. as minimal as possible. as parallel as is safe to execute.
I see. thanks. much better than what I was going to do üôÇ
for non writes they may be run in parallel for multiple accounts, based on system logic for processing
its sequential, in order, after signed and submitted.
any write or update there after, would be considered a created+initialized account, and you can check an 'isInitialized' flag, if necessary.
I see. That makes sense. I wasn't sure if the instructions of a transaction execute serially or in parallel across their respective programs
you can essentially initialize an account, as many other programs do, the idea being in the same transaction, create, then initialize.   eg: instruction 1: create the account instruction 2: initialize  [..,1,2...] in 1 transaction.
So if I create a new account, then the first time the program goes to write something there, I guess it can check if all bytes are zero as a proxy for deciding if it is "empty". It would be nice if the system program let you specify a constant value to initialize a new account's data with.
not per say, that I am aware of. This would be up to the program managing the account to track or manage.
I did, but I'm using an in-house scaffold generator. I could show you the file layout I'm using, though.
Do you guys have any idiomatic way to check if an `AccountInfo`'s data has previously been written to or is brand spanking new at runtime?
hey anyone know why serumV3Usdc in token-list would cause auto merge to fail?
any idea of how to increase my node performance, or my web3 operations performance? I got one from quicknode, it works pretty well, but I'm thinking about ways to make operations faster or with less offset, what do you guys suggest?
Is there anyone who used scaffolding to set up a project ?
no. i do not believe changing the decimal after creating the spl-token is possible.
say I create a token from the CLI with `spl-token create-token --decimals 2`, can I change the decimals to 9 even after creating some supply? I couldn't find any documentation about this?
Hi all. I'm not sure what channel to post this question to so please guide me to the appropriate one if this is not the one:

Is there a way to change the number of **decimals** of an already created spl-token?
Anyone can help please??

Hey, requests to arweave are very slow for me
https://docs.pyth.network/how-pyth-works/account-structure
https://pyth.network/
an example of this implementation is pyth
it is not too easy to describe
say you have mapping account A - this contains a list of pubkeys for whitelisted addresses and one pubkey for the next mapping account (account B), repeat for account B


to get a full list of whitelisted accounts you can look up the pubkey added to account A, which maps to account B, repeat for B until you come to the end of the chain and loop out each whitelisted address
I'm confused about the decimals.

I got a token with 1.25B supply, registered with 9 decimals.

If i use some wallets and go from ``8`` figures, 9 million tokens, to ``9`` figures, 10 million tokens - i can't send them.

Same whenever i try to list them in ANY serum market, i can list 9.9 million tokens, but not a single one over 10 million, then i get ``assertion failed``, normally i would've visited the serum discord, but this feels related to the decimals i've registered. 

Can anyone clue me in whats going on here?
I've used that approach, I include in the instruction batch# and total batches# so when the last batch is received it considers the account data initialized, then the rest of instructions can work.
One thing to note, the larger the vector of keys you serialize the more execution units you use. I am doubtful that you will ever make it for that reason. In which case, <@!848333406849073202> approach makes more sense.
Hey all, I'm attempting to mint an NFT with metaplex's candy machine and I'm receiving a 0x138 custom program error on devnet. transaction signature is 2P3uAb5TTseVBbpbCLP8sGRdFodyHHpjrF3GotB5ETtzQBb8sfp9a2pmWcQ4CeCRzFDJRiK67kDWkkhmWDU6uxxE. Anyone know what the 0x138 error means?
i was able to send i think 31 to the program in one transaction, so i was thinking of something like this. a for loop in web three that will run for the total number of public Keys to be whitelisted and send only 30 publickeys at one time. once that transaction is completed I can move to next 30 and so one!
by this do you mean to create an account that holds the public keys for other accounts that will hold whitelisted public keys?
Or like <@!848333406849073202> says üôÇ
I do not know the 'when' and even if done not sure it will offer bulk to the extent you need. One workaround is a bit if workflow logic in your program that accumulates 'chunks' and only makes it usable after processing the last chunk.
alternatively you can set up an account which maps to additional accounts, where each account stores a set of whitelisted pubkeys. this was you can keep adding as you see fit
<@!814228493302497301> sorry for mentioning you in this message and this might be off topic but do you have any idea when will the transaction size increase because as of now it is 1232 bytes which isn't very helpful when trying to store bulk addresses in one call to the program. this is the use case for storing publickey in a program owned account that will be used for whitelisting
yes,  i had learned that from experience. but i had it there since i was testing with a single pubkey first and then it was just laying there now needlessly removed it and everythings working great!
thank you <@!814228493302497301>
`msg!()` should be used sparingly and not try to pump a lot of data through it
Well, that operation will surely exhaust execution units. Formatting is a killer when you want to do it with 320 K
<@!814228493302497301> ```rust
msg!("hrerererererer{:?} ",greeting_acc.data);```
this is what was eating up all the compute units.. i had it in place to check something and i forgot about it finally remembered and removed it and deployed the program and it worked. i did have errors because of it before so as soon as i saw this i knew this is the culprit
i think i got what the problem was running a check on it now and i'll let you know what was up with that.
Are there any constraints on the size or contents of seed values used for generating PDAs? 16 Bytes in length, I guess
If you are calling an 'Initialization' type thing, you do not yet have the Pubkeys correct? Or are they already populated?
```Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: Program failed to complete

Hello everyone,

 I am currently trying to perform automated swaps of tokens on various exchanges including Saber. I chose a SOL -> xSOL swap as an example for the moment. I have been using the stable-swap-client module from Saber (https://docs.rs/stable-swap-client/1.5.2/stable_swap_client/) but I can move to spl-token-swap if needed (https://docs.rs/spl-token-swap/2.1.0/spl_token_swap/index.html). 

If I understood correctly, I need to chain the instructions Initialize -> Swap -> Deposit -> Withdraw -> Withdraw_One in order to perform the swap. I used the respective functions to build my swap before activating a transaction. However, I cannot find any documentation on what corresponds to each Pubkey : I can find most keys in the Saber pool json (https://registry.saber.so/data/pools-info.mainnet.json) (and I suppose I can find the equivalent json for other exchanges), however I do not know what some keys are. For instance, the deposit function (or deposit_all_token_types in the case of spl-token-swap) requires a deposit_token_a_pubkey and a swap_token_a_pubkey, yet I have no idea about what they represent. 

Is this the right way of performing a swap ? Is there any documentation on the meaning of these keys and how to find them ?
So you create the account with that size (appox. 320 K). What error are you getting from the program.
```let pub:PublicKey[]=new Array(9999);
for (let i=0;i<pub.length;i++){
    pub[i]=new PublicKey(0)
}
const GREETING_SIZE = borsh.serialize(
    GreetingSchema,
    new GreetingAccount({counter:0,is_initialized:false,tokenAddress:pub}),
).length;
```
with this account is being created with my required size(319977) no problem 
but when i interact with it it gives this error even though the instruction that i'm calling isn't interacting with that particular pubkey field. it just deserializes the struct and then set one of it's field to true and serializes the account data and exits

is there any way to make it work? because if i can't store those publickeys it wouldn't do me any goood....

hey all, i'm building a social app which needs to store some user data (call them posts). I want to store these on chain in an account so the app loads all the posts (and all users can see posts from others). Does it make sense to do it this way given that there's a 10mb limit on the data property of an account? fishing for patterns/approaches
Hai, how to calculate Gas fee and Gas limit ? can anyone help ?
Makes sense. Thank you.
I'm using the solana web3 and i don't know how can i set the signverify off in that method because there is no method either in the connection or the transaction class for that
You got a solflare or a phantom wallet

Ok, so you need the market ID of the token/nft in question
It says invalif
That's the token address
Should be this: 3j1i465ruGiosCB3nhPVAF4aVRIPJRJVKQBRQAWNAKf3 < if this is your market ID
Should I use a DApp DB like arweave ? Or just a traditional DB for the following :

For the DApp I‚Äôm building I‚Äôd like to show a marketplace basically. This means each public key of a wallet can be used to identify their listings

I can‚Äôt find any design that would let me ready/ query this off the chain right? I would need to store publicKeys and map those to the items that people are selling

Same with the history of a specific user - I would need to associate the items they sold or bought and store that in a DB right?
What do I put in market id
Add a custom market on your DEX, on Raydium just click the little + sign in the corner

Hi all, I am working on basic RPC calls for tests. Each RPC call is either
1) creating an account (which needs a signer) but the account itself is not a signer in the actual program
2) updating an account without a signer

I continously get "     Error: unknown signer: 7CNZgMVynXBYMsAYM7aVPsW4sxvUJ9TajSMdBwDF8gf1 " with different signer erros whenever I run the anchor testt command. Any thoughts on what is causing the issue

Cron Job for Smart Contract? How to make the program run by itself after X time period?


I‚Äôm working on a DApp where a user sends some token/ NFT to be held by a PDA.

If the user does not take an action within a specified period of time (let‚Äôs say 1 weeks) then I want to automatically trigger sending the token/NFT held by the PDA back to the user.

So in traditional programming, we could run a cron job or async job for this.

In Solana / Smart contracts what‚Äôs the equivalent here ? How exactly do I schedule something to run ?

I will be able to have various account information / data to pass into the smart-contract and I‚Äôd like the smart contract to then do validation (I.e does this request even need to run? If it needs to run let do it)
Can someone point me to an example of smart contract where we do transfer of some tokens inside the smart contract?

this is giving an error, the signers are complete in it. payer account,the mint account and the token account as well.
I didn't think it was serialization

Hi Team,
Is it possible to create the wrapped SPL Tokens and ERC20 ?
you can take a look at  https://jstarry.notion.site/Transaction-Fees-f09387e6a8d84287aa16a34ecb58e239 for more detail about fee.
and you can also just use simulate transaction to know the result.
and also is there any function in the web3 that i can use to get the transaction fee payer before i send transaction to the blockchain, to check whether a wallet has enough balance in it or not for performing the transaction?
Borsh is more efficient
hey everybody, so once i call the function ```await sendAndConfirmTransaction``` it would only return the transaction signature only if the transactions is successful right if the transaction fails it won't return the signature right?
I want to make sure that a transaction has succeeded before continuing with my other processes what would be the best approach for that?
I'm reading the whitepaper and I'm having trouble wrapping my head around proof of history. It uses the example of photograph_1_hash being before photograph_2_hash because photo 1 hash is earlier in the sequence of hashes, but whats actually stopping you reordering events and regenerating the hashes. Surely you just end up with a harder to validate proof of work if there's enough hashes that it isn't feasible?
Yes I am trying to pack it into instruction data but in which format it should be like?

Interesting üòä
Even if it‚Äôs not 1000, it is stil possible to have multiple tx with the same fee payer (assuming tx data is different) included in the same block right ? The lock is not for the full duration of the block but rather for the short amount of time it is used to process the transaction no ?
hello, I have multiple subscriptions to `onAccountChange` but only one is ever triggered. I'm not unsubscribing anywhere as the subscription and unsubscription code is grouped for both callbacks (to see if I can make it work with a minimal working example). does anybody else have this problem?
Is it possible to send multiple separated transactions in the same block ? Except from durable nonce, Solana does not seem to have nonce. Is there any ordering by the validator ? By time or reception maybe ?

I'm trying to understand how escrow programs work as that's a direction I am headed towards.
Very stupid question yet, https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/

Is this only for Party A and B and then I need to deploy a whole new program for Party C and D to escrow transact or does the escrow program hold a pool of funds in relation to the parties transacting?
I think there are too many things you have to check. I'm not sure how to help you but i can give you some point to do it.
1. it is ed25519 verify, you will need data (message serialize data), pubkey and signature.
2. you can get a random success tx use the same way to check your flow is right.
<@!788215642070581289>  I did the  same, I sent my message to phantom to sign the message and in response it provide me the signature and public key. Now what I want is verify that signature in backend somehow I used the Py-nacl module to do so but was unsuccess to do it. I dont know where I am missing what.
you can just request phantom to sign tx but don't send it
use some lib like nacl to verify the signature.
I'm just guessing.
there is a good article https://jstarry.notion.site/Transaction-Fees-f09387e6a8d84287aa16a34ecb58e239
okay
only accounts owned by system program can use system program transfer.
I don't dig deep but I just guess the account not owned by system program so it need to modify its lamports directly
maybe check this https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program
instead of using the transfer instruction on system program?
why do you guys do all of this manual lamport manipulation in metaplex:

@everyone  Can someone  help me in making  signature verification process while making login flow? e.g like https://www.solanium.io/ login flow.
Yep <@!788215642070581289> , that's understood, but Actually, I need to pass in some data into the account. Think about this like I am sending the program an account with the program's state itself, so that program can get the saved data from the account, and then process the whole thing.

Here is an example, about what I did earlier:

```
        let mut metadata_account = TestAccount::new(
            metadata_min_balance_needed,
            MAX_METADATA_LEN,
            &Pubkey::new_unique()
        ); 
// TestAccount is coming from
// solana_sdk::account::Account as TestAccount

        let metadata = Metadata {
            key: Key::MetadataV1,
            update_authority: Pubkey::new_unique(),
            mint: Pubkey::new_unique(),
            data: Data {
                name: String::from("Hello, world!"),
                symbol: String::from("Hello, world!"),

            &mut &mut metadata_accountinfo.data.borrow_mut()[..]
        ).unwrap();

```

here basically first i created an Account, then I have created an metadata instance, and then serialized that metadata instance to the accounts state/data. And then I have passed it to the programs processor. Such that I have to create an account stub, for using it with solana_program_test Transaction.
``getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner`` returns a ``uint8Array``
<@!829667434239098910> do you know any resource on how to parse a custom program
sounds weird. maybe check your endpoint. BTW I've written some code for you and it works fine
```js
import { Connection, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

(async () => {
  const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");

  let res = await connection.getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner(
    new PublicKey("av6Audt1fhGyXAZMoTPTrVfMAXfRBymhgbP5EpMAzCg"),
    {
      programId: new PublicKey("TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"),
    }
  );

  console.log(JSON.stringify(res));
})();
```
loader will do it for you. you don't need to carry data in your transaction.
on client side, you pass what accounts you will use in the program (just like what you're doing) then you send the tx. 
on program side, you can use these accounts which you passed including fetch lamports, data ...
Hi There! 

I am writing a test for my program, I am using `solana-sdk, solana_program and solana_program_test` for writing the tests, as I have to write a stub I need to an account with some data of some length in it. But it seems like solana_program does not have data field on it, I want to send solana_program's `AccountInfo` struct in the Instruction, But it seems like the Instruction struct only supports a vec of `AccountMeta`. So my question was how can I pass AccountMeta with data to the Transaction Struct. My code:

```
    let mut transaction = Transaction::new_with_payer(
        &[
            Instruction::new_with_bytes(
                some_program_id,
                &data,
                vec![
                    AccountMeta::new(initers_key.pubkey(), true),
                    AccountMeta::new(some_account.pubkey(), false),
                    AccountMeta::new(some_program_account.pubkey(), false),
                    AccountMeta::new(spl_token::id(), false),
                    AccountMeta::new(pda.0, false),
                ],
            )
        ],
        Some(&payer.pubkey())
    );
```

In this `AccountMeta::new(some_program_account.pubkey(), false),` I have to set the data of account, so the program can process this. How can I do that?
ah i see
why does ``getParsedProgramAccounts`` not return parsed data
whats wrong with this code? it returns 404
```js
await connection.getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner(
        new anchor.web3.PublicKey('av6Audt1fhGyXAZMoTPTrVfMAXfRBymhgbP5EpMAzCg'),
        { programId: new anchor.web3.PublicKey('TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA') }
      )
```
hey guys ,I start a solana genesis node by following  solana-project/multinode-demo/setup.sh . My node started , but it keep printing Program Vote111111111111111111111111111111111111111 invoke [1]  and success . Am I enable some config like stress test ?
answering my own question, but for the interested: looks like Metaplex gumdrop is one way to deal with whitelisting users for candy machine mints: https://lwus.github.io/gumdrop/
For mapping data. you can use BTreeMap or use PDA to do the mapping.
(3rd from last bullet-point)
If your program owns the account then you should modify it, not some other program. See the policy section here: <https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/runtime> - this sounds like where the error is coming from, when the transaction processor is applying the policy after the other-program invocation.
like solidity.
how can I use map variable on Solana network?
How are you today?
Hi <@!489206164270350337>
Of course there are some good guidance discovered so far... point is it's very early days, so blaze a trail, think something through thoroughly and name it and write it up as a new design pattern, then wait for Apple to copy it and rename it and claim it's theirs (because that's how this works).
I verified it is though. Original link is https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/906247338513793045. But I'm not clear on why it's unable to modify the account that it owns itself, even if it's being called through a CPI.
lol "say how old you are without giving any numbers"
sure sure, fair points! (I've been in the game since Ruby on Rails was the New Hotness / coincident with jQuery first releases / just after EJBs in Java-land were going out of style, for context üòÜ )
If you've been around a while... to see programming languages evolve things (for example async await, and optional/nullable types, or going back even further interfaces, classes, and OOP itself...) then you'll recognise that what is a "design pattern" or "best practice" eventually becomes so normal that languages bake them in, and new design patterns and practices can form on top of them. I don't think solana dev has been around long enough to even form many best practices, although I hear anchor has encapsulated some good ones... it'll probably evolve a bit more before we know what can go wrong with different approaches and how to avoid it.
wowza just found a treasure trove of info: https://hackmd.io/@archaeopteryx/By4bpbA4F
Well there you go - you want to see how "real devs" do it - I expect that those guys probably know a lot more than most, so seems like a good place to learn. Even if you want to make different decisions than they did you can spot their intention in the code, and be inspired by how they achieved it.
I hear you for sure. I feel like I'm trying to strike a balance between "I really want to learn how this works fundamentally" and "I want to understand best practices/idioms other ppl in industry are using"
we grew so much that babies are able to code simple web2
yuppp ahaha
same, web2 -> web3 migrant üòÜ
I'm kind of the opposite, trying to learn how it works, and things like "use this magic thing instead" gets in the way and introduces a whole load of terminology that I don't realise is irrelevant initially üòÑ
I'm a software dev moving to blockchain <:shovel:840350031999664179>
yup: https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/
Is it open source? then yeah!
what I'm taking away is:
1. most projects just use Metaplex candy machine
2. they use ^ not for its intended purpose (ie to enforce flp) but as a way to create nfts from static assets/metadata
3. projects w/ presale either use 2 candy machines or just 1 machine and a special presale link (this seems horrible for things like...ensuring only WL ppl have access...)
4. I should probably just read the candy machine code and use it as a starting point
I'm certainly not a "real dev" on Solana yet. ü§£
no no the opposite! I want to make something new. Just I was trying to start from a point where I understand how "normal" projects do things so I could build off of that
tbh most of that stuff seems to be pure hype... why don't you just silently launch your project and let people mint away until they're all gone, promoting it once it's live? Do you need everyone to be frothing at the mouth to get your NFTs all at once? If so, maybe there's no real value there?
mostly I just wanna know how the "real devs" are doing things
well...not "art" art but I think you know what I mean üòÜ
yeah lol that's what I'd be looking to avoid is the royal mess ups...but at the same time I'd hope to understand enough about the underlying implementation to be able to step in if things go wrong and/or to make cool bespoke nfts that still leverage as much prior art as possible
How they do it is just a common pattern though - you could do it totally differently... you might implement a pre-post-mid-sale-swap-thingamabob. But if you just want to do a normal same thing everyone else does, then there are probably common things that can go wrong, and they (claim to) solve it? I don't know what problems they solve exactly, that you couldn't just do yourself, but from what I heard here people have royally messed it up before.
which is...interesting...
I just got this as an answer in Metaplex discord:
```
Many create a candy machine for whitelist and one for the public.
Others create one machine for both and share the mint link to presale a bit earlier‚Ä¶
Most of them use candy machine
If you are searching for a project you want to do yourself I would propose to look at candy machine together with gumdrop.
```
right. The other part that I feel like I'm missing is all of Metaplex's Candy Machine docs talk about how it enforces fair launch protocol etc but almost no projects I've seen do that - like they _all_ have a presale + public mint
Yeah - I don't fully get it either... but as far as I understand, it's a for-profit service that they offer, not an open-source library you can use to do it yourself.
like in ETH you can 1. look at just about any nft project's code on-chain, 2. extend from OpenZeppelin's contracts. Here it's completely different
thanks! I seem to be in this situation where everyone keeps pointing to "just use metaplex candy machine" which, as I look at docs...has a bunch of cli commands to run but not much in the way of like libraries to extend from or whatnot like i'd normally expect. So I'm thinking I've got to be missing something
Learning how to structure/architect something by looking at code might limit you to only learn how that implementation did it - sounds like you want to learn how it actually works so that you can use that to create your own architecture. Helping you to answer questions like How should I implement a pre-sale whitelist? How do I manage minting? - So you'll need a good knowledge of how Solana works, plus general algorithms and data structures knowledge for creating a solution on top of that platform.
If the account was created by a call to the token program, then it's owned by that program, not your program, if you want an account owned by your program that you can store data in then you need to create a PDA. I'm guessing you're using anchor, which I haven't learned yet, but I've seen it has a `derived` macro, so that's probably the thing to look into. There's an anchor discord too üòÑ
I have this loose constellation of knowledge for how all this stuff is related but it seems like finding actual code to learn from is few-and-far-between
can anyone point me to resources? Maybe codebases for actual NFT projects that _aren't_ using candy machine / FLP out of the box but can support presale + public sale minting?
I guess regarding entry points, there are many - each individual instruction is an entry-point of sorts. The validators run the validator software - there will be an entry-point for the validator software, so finding that in the code would be a good place.
I'm getting the "modifying data of an account it does not own"
vs most "real" projects I see have like a presale which precludes candy machine / flp
Yes, thanks for the reply. I did check it at https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf. Unfortunately the whitepaper is more like a detailed version of the descriptions in https://docs.solana.com/ and does not really talk about the code specification/implementation-details.
That makes sense! So I have a Metadata program modifying a metadata account. And I've provided an external instruction so a third party can invoke that instruction. But no luck.
I read up on Metaplex / joined their discord. But that seems limited, ie candy machine/flp
hey all! So I'm trying to figure out how "real" solana nft devs structure things
<@!420813860811833347> did you read the whitepaper? I haven't read it yet but that sounds like the place you want to read.
Hey guys, does anyone has an answer to my question?
Here is my question:

1. What I aim to do:
I seek to understand here is the blockchain infrastructure itself (i.e., the code in the repo: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana).
The information in https://docs.solana.com/ and https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf are too high-level 
and not talking about the code specification/implementation-details.
So I'm trying to trace the layer1 code directly to gain knowledge from the code implementation.

2. My current status:
* I've already read through almost everything in https://docs.solana.com/ 
* And I understand how to write a "program" on the Solana blockchain.

3. My question:
For ./runtime/src in https://github.com/solana-labs/solana that I'm currently tracing here. 
Can anyone tell me how is this folder used in the project?
Can anyone tell me where's the start point of the code control flows that uses the implementations in this folder?
(It's hard to trace the control flow without knowing how a library is used in a project.)
Only the owner can modify it - i.e. the program - so the only way you can modify an account owned by a different program is through one of the instructions provided by that program - kind of an important security detail if you think about it üòõ And `invoke_signed` is for signing on behalf of a PDA that your program owns. It's all described here: <https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs>
Specifically how would I modify account data from a third party account, assuming I make a CPI call to an instruction in the account's owner program.
https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program#dumping-a-program-to-a-file
Tell me more! How do I check the hash of the on chain program?
also, here, can we not open issues? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js
You can dump the executable to a file and compare the hashes with the opensource compiled program
you can compile the program yourself and see if the compiled program matches what is deployed
Right. I love that Solana uses Rust. But making calls on a random Solana program feels unsafe given the code is obfuscated. Trust building becomes paramount since a malicious dev could upload their source to github but deploy a modified program to the blockchain.
this is a problem on most non eth chains, not having a tool like etherscan. One solution is to just upload the non compiled code to github, like what defi kingdoms has done
This is probably a very silly question but is it possible to view a deployed Solana program like you can with Etherscan and Solidity? I'm guessing not since Rust / C++ are compiled. This raises questions about how one would audit a program that's been deployed if the source is not viewable.
how can i parse that and its logs with program? I know there is a way to use program to parse instruction data
```
Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 4: custom program error: 0x135 

```
<@!788215642070581289> Our program size has now become bigger than what we have in the program data account. We are getting the error `ProgramData account not large enough` which can be seen in this TX: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3BaZHyzqWbJEH5njJrSBXe5SUPUcN2TKSBv2uoJp5U4sQ6wBRyoNpLpjbNnKDTUz8zPkDYv1CM1w45CkLnhFqSVL

Running `solana program deploy --commitment finalized --program-id $PROGRAM_ID ./$DEPLOYED_PROGRAM_PATH` is what got us the original error which has been your response for fixing this error in the past. Is there any way to change our program to use a new program data account with a larger size?
something like
hi guys, how is there a way for me to parse solana program errors?
Hello guys, quick question, I am looking for an elegant way to write a text in the account data while overwriting the previous text? The problem is that my input is a string with variable size and the field in my account data is fixed at 50 bites.

The problem is that "my_string" can have different sizes so I end up with the behaviour:
1st program call: my_string = "abcdef" -> my_string_field  becomes "abcdef"
2nd program call:  my_string = "123" -> my_string_field becomes "123def"

Right now I am doing something like this:
account_info.my_string_field = new_string;
account_info.serialize(&mut *data_account.data.borrow_mut())?;
Solana uses arweave, zero.  Metaplex folks use it though
I have some questions
Can I talk to you about that on a private chat?
so I'm asking here (since solana uses arweave a lot)
I know people have overcome it
I went there... and unfortunately I didn't get sufficient help
Sounds like questions for arweave support?
up to like a minute
and when I batch them in groups of like 10/20/30 etc it just gets worse
It takes ~5 seconds per file
I'm trying to download 10k metadata files
> Since executable accounts are immutable, any lamports in the account will be frozen when the account is marked executable. The lamport balance should therefore be no more than the minimum balance required for rent-free storage.
How is this enforced? If I change an account to be executable, but it does not have the minimum rent-free balance -- will it throw an error?
What are you trying to do? Usually it's not too bad and the RPC node is the slow part.
and kinda unusable
but I'm finding arweave painfully slow
Sooo idk if anyone here has epxerience with this
I'm attempting to understand CPIs and am not fully clear on the invoke calls. What are the different use cases for invoke vs invoke_signed and why would you choose one over the other?
Importing the value from the package did the trick. Most of time it works with just writting the string value but not when the value is then serialized to another type within the instruction i guess.
Thanks üôÇ
You could run it and see exactly what is set in `createSetAuthorityInstruction`
Also, here's an example in the tests of using just `setAuthority` https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/cli/token-test.js#L404
The current program can be found here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs
I think the main problem may be with serialization on your part. Try using the type https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L86
Hey üôÇ 

Unsure why i'm getting this what is seems like unrecognised value error.
```    
    'Program log: Instruction: SetAuthority',
    'Program log: Error: Account does not support specified authority type',
    'Program TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA consumed 1598 of 20000

js : 
```
        Token.createSetAuthorityInstruction(
            TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
            mint.publicKey,
            new PublicKey("XXX"),
            "AccountOwner",

this seems like the right one :

any help?
hey im working on my nft, but when uploading i get this message
Yeah, auth controlled is probably better
Anyway- I know very little about how to write programs yet.. mostly just learned how the platform works. No doubt with a lot of misunderstandings and holes. üòÑ
I see, so validators set that during transaction processing. I guess you can trust it to be reasonably accurate. I'd still probably opt for an authority-controlled data change to configure program behaviour.
Then `clock.unix_timestamp`
You can use `solana_program::sysvar::{clock::Clock, Sysvar}`
I didn't realise there was a time function available within a program. Maybe you'd use an epoch/slot or something.
You could do many different things. Enable flag, mode, hard timestamp, etc
Timestamp? Wouldn't you put an "enable" flag in the account data and change it with an authority account? (or perhaps "mode" that you can dev/debug against before switching it to live/prod)
Awesome. Glad to have you! We definitely need more senior engineers in the space
Well everyone still seems to be using node servers - which I've never seen in any professional team I've worked in (except for once with AWS lambdas) where we've had to build a scalable solution. I've seen Java, Scala, .NET, Ruby, Kotlin, Go, and sometimes PHP (I work on the mobile app side though so not intimately familiar with the server-side infra). Anyway - mobile is not innovating any more, so I'm looking for what will be big over the next decade and this is what I picked to learn üòÑ
Yeah. It really was a sorry scene at the time. No one really understood how to properly scale a site, or have a program only execute post a specific timestamp
I see. So just shoddy dev work then. I guess I'm coming at this from "I want to learn the platform properly so that I can easily find work as an expert consultant in the field, architecting great solutions for my clients for the next decade" whereas they probably came as "how do I quickly do this without actually understanding it to get in on this action".
Unfortunately no one could really figure it out pre-candy machine. Every NFT mint site died immediately and there were tons of exploits where you could switch your NFT's metadata during the mint.
Oh yes yes yes, only know have I read that the frontend requests an API challenge, which I assume always changes, so it can't be replicated, if you have a constant/static message and somebody gets the chance to use your private key one time, or eavesdrops when you send it, they can reuse it countless of times
Oh - well I've only been learning about Solana (and crypto in general, and NFTs and all the other stuff) since the end of October, so I 'm too new to really know. And I haven't really looked at how the whole NFTs/marketplaces/etc. work. Seems like it'd be a case of creating an architecture and a minting program that does what you want... and metaplex have made a (presumably generic/somewhat configurable) version of that. Maybe it's harder than I think though üòÑ
Should be able to move to SOL easily
The concept is the same. Take the token generated, sign on user front end, validate on backend.
Thanks for the resource! I have never developed on ethereum, this will help me a lot!!!
This is a validator form. I would check in <#560174212967432193>

Just use `solana program deploy` will go through everything
what fields
"safe enough" for what? This is more of a web2 architecture design question. I would look into how ethereum logins work today and try to do something similar with phantom https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/serverless-auth
When registering, you need to specify this key in both fields?
Keys will work across all envs
In version 1.8.5 when running the command "solana-keygen new -o ~/validator-keypair.json" is created mainnet key or testnet key?
You sure?  Before Metaplex candy machine, every NFT drop was a clusterfuck üòÇ
do you knwo what could be an alternative way to deploy it
Hi, Jacob, sorry for tagging
But do you think it would be safer to have a Redis db where, on the first "Wallet Connect" request to store an Expire Key with a random message, which then gets sent back to the user for signing, so that the message is always different for increased security? Or do you think it is already safe enough as it is?
Correct. Basketball tickets, selling "art", free parking pass, etc
Well.. that's one use-case out of an infinite sea of possibilities, right? An NFT could be used to represent the right to park your car in a particular parking spot between certain times... or visit a holiday home on certain dates... right?
NFTs are fun little badges, but create "ownership" in a digital world. Probably majorly useful for games
It's all a bit hazy to me all that NFT stuff... I'm more interested in the core tech and other cool uses that can be built on top of it üòÑ - certainly I should learn about how all that works too though, I suppose.
Yeah, they can write their own minting tools. All marketplaces integrate with the spl-token wrapper that metaplex created, but it is permissionless so anyone could plug into it
I guess it's so that non-developers can do it all then? A dev team can just write their own minting tools, rules, etc.? Or is it that all the marketplaces integrate to their tools but not to some indie's custom ones?
They kind of own the standard for NFTs on Solana and have a bunch of tools for minting NFT collections, distributing them, sales, etc
I still don't fully understand what metaplex does - is it basically a service so you don't have to write your own minting program?
They've brought this upon themselves!
poor metaplex
https://discord.gg/metaplex
You want the Metaplex discord for candy machine support anyway
no plz help kek
Yeah - thanks for confirming üôÇ Plan is to leave it staked long term, I'll just need to fund the account again later to cover fees on withdraw I guess (or provide separate `--fee-payer` and `-withdraw-authority` perhaps).
Still can't read the green text?
Keep in mind that if you expect it to pay fees, it _will_ need some SOL
Nice - good.. glad the rent Lamports get paid to validators and/or stakers, not just destroyed.
Your stake authority doesn't have to exist on chain at all.  It just needs to be able to sign
Any ideas why it's failing ?
File an issue because it looks like there may be a bug in the steps
Rewards on the epoch I believe
Yeah that's what I understand... will the 488 Lamports be collected and the account immediately deleted, so not even present during the epoch? Who gets those lamports?
Try Metaplex for candy machine needs https://discord.gg/metaplex
My understanding it that it is dealloced and gone
Ok.. so my stake-authority account is about to be deleted soon - I didn't leave quite enough in it to be rent-exempt and it's been gradually reducing. It has 2927 Lamports, so enough for 1 epoch, but not two. Does this mean it will be deleted entirely when there isn't enough? Next rent will take it down to 488 Lamports, then next time there won't be enough... what will happen?
any idea what can be done
Just got around to doing the same flow as you and ran into the same issue
I believe some people have done this at alon https://github.com/lithdew/alon
Hey guys, I am trying to compile the `Solana-sdk` for a wasm app (need to access the pubkey primitives), but some compilation error happens in a dependency of it (when targeting wasm). Is what I am trying to do even possible?
üòâ

```cd ~
solana-test-validator```
Don't mess with that dir
No
as solana installed in /home/rokitman/.config/solana, may be here ?
Judging by the questions you're asking, no chance that / is writable by your user
just do that, but from your ~.
It automatically creates it in the current directory
where i should create that directory test-ledger? /test-ledger ?
Yeah you should fix that instead
Should still not run as root
The solution to Linux CLI errors is never, "blindly throw sudo at it"
but as user, I got  Error: Unable to create directory test-ledger: Permission denied (os error 13)
thanks
Don't run it as `root`
Looks like you don't have permission to create a folder where you're running things
but sudo solana-test-validator give me command not found ...
I'm on Ubuntu 20, and solana-test-validator give me : Error: Unable to create directory test-ledger: Permission denied (os error 13)
Check in the metaplex discord https://discord.gg/metaplex
okay, so we might need to tweak the contracts to make that possible
Not sure about today's state, but shouldn't be impossible to change if it doesn't already exist
yes
For payment?
no my question is, for minting the NFT can we use a custom fungible token rather than SOL?
They're wrappers around spl-token
The NFTs minted by metaplex are custom spl-tokens
can we use a custom spl-token to mint nfts using metaplex?
Trying it out myself, never done before
If you run explorer locally, or make your cluster custom: `localhost:8899`, you'll hit local-test-validator
that means, I can't check transactions on solana explorer ?
That's local, not devnet
<@!489206164270350337>solana-test-validator is only for devnet cluster ?
thank you!
You can get the mint using `getMintInfo` https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L725
do you have any ideas what could it be; seem to be doing everything according to the tutorial
Thanks! but i see that this is called on the token mint - how do I retrieve that mint object? Can I reconstruct it from the mint address?
I don't think it is related to anchor
using buffer because want to deploy using ledger; could it be somehow related because im deploying an anchor program
You can use `getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo` https://solanacookbook.com/recipes/basic-transactions.html#sending-spl-tokens
If I have an NFT already in my wallet (spl token), how can I programmatically transfer it to another user's address? I know I have to create a token account for the recipient, but how do I do this without the mint instruction?
where can i check how much sol i need ?
i'm still learning and playing around sorry<:1286jesus:911028119081746463>
thank you guys so much
oh i thought 1 sol was enough
Did you read the error log?
You don't have enough SOL
anybody know why this is failing ?
It looks like you can just use `solana program deploy` without the account, as you'll be doing the buffer account intermediate anyways. https://jstarry.notion.site/Program-deploys-29780c48794c47308d5f138074dd9838#561f8e76208a46b8963092adabab2256
Yeah, that's what I am doing but when I am passing this account to deploy it doesnt work
I would expect the first command, `solana program write-buffer <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>` to make a large enough buffer account. If you're just using `solana program deploy <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>` then something else is happening
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
basically following the steps here: https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program
The buffer account you are using must not be large enough to deploy your program
You're using `solana program deploy`?
r
works fine when i dont use buffe
nope first deployment
Are you redeploying? Looks like your new program can't fit on whatever accounts exist
Keep getting this error when trying to deploy:
```
Error: Buffer account passed is not large enough, may have been for a different deploy?
```
oh right, I didn't even know that we had to do that. I thouhgt transaction fee cover everything
You should pay for rpc from genesysgo, quicknode, triton, or another service
ok, but what I should use in production ? if my app is online and users start to make transaction, i continue to use solana-test-validator or public with rate limits ?
Someone built this that you could use https://github.com/sunguru98/solana-whitelisting-program
You can check with `solana feature status`
Hello everyone I am new to solana, I would like to know if there is a possibility to add on a token a black / whitelist restriction
how to do a pre-sale / private sale on it, for the moment all the videos that I found and what I saw on the solana dev site does not offer things of the kind
Thank you in advance for your help!
None at this time. Being integrated now
How I can find that specific feature is activated? For example https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/18631 / https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/1.8.5/solana_sdk/feature_set/tx_wide_compute_cap/index.html
there is any example using it?
You'll have to build the webapp
Blog posts are very welcome. Part of my job is to help facilitate them, so feel free to send them my way. I'll make sure to get as many eyes on them as possible
I want to check interface like webapp.
by the way, what is the result?
Yeah, I get you. It's just hard to see the utility of the "hello, world" example if there are no follow-ups that build upon what one has already learned. Right now, it seems like, as a learning developer, I was directed to "hello, world" and then immediately to anchor, as all non-trivial examples besides internal solana programs are in anchor. I will aim to make some blog posts as time goes on to help in the effort. Thanks again üôÇ
Thank you.
thanks
Reading about it, sounds just like NFTs. So metaplex
do you konw where is wrong?
from the sounds of it, this is likely
Hello, there are the concept of POAP¬¥s in Solana?
Is there a problem with the configuration of the node server I built locally? I am not very clear now
Sounds like something may be wrong with your local setup
i use getSlot this function also return null for me
You have to have your account exist locally for it to exist
You can use both
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/rust Reference specifically auction-house and auction
i have recharged yesterday ,but yesterday i used public service rpc api
I am going to build smart contract for NFT marketplace using Rust, what should I reference?
yes is exit
I am using my own local node machine
Does the account exist?
yes i use rpc api, but on my local service i try to user this rpc function,but get data is null
getBalance get data? Are you using RPC? What account? Please provide details
Does anyone know, thanks
i getBalance get data is null why
cool, I'll ask around the Metaplex discord. Thanks again üôè
Please provide more information
Does anyone know
Metaplex is basically like erc721 as a standard for nfts on solana. NFTs outside of that are far and few to come by
The node server built locally returns null. Why?
cool thank you. Do virtually all solana nft devs use metaplex then?
All Metaplex code is open source https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex So you're welcome to peruse the code. Metaplex docs exist and go over most of what you need https://docs.metaplex.com/, otherwise I would recommend heading over to metaplex discord and asking more detailed questions there https://discord.gg/metaplex
I've taken some deep dives in the docs but it's just not "coming together" in my head if that makes sense
Whereas on ETH I can just peruse source on the blockchain, that doesn't seem to be an option over here in SOL land
I know Metaplex is a thing and that Solana has a built in Token program...but I feel like all the knowledge I have so far is just kind of a loose constellation...I'm looking for like a good blog /tutorial, a large body of code to read through, or both.
hey folks! What's the best place to get started w/ Solana NFTs?
It's not impossible, but not something that is Solana related. There's plenty of APIs out there to do it, you just have to look outside of solana github and solana developer support
Please help me if someone has experience in this kind of stuff
ty
Test account was connected to Phantom wallet, and I get its lamports using `getBalance` or `getAccountInfo`  functions from <@569580494283603980>na/web3.js connection. 
But I also need its price. For example, if I have 1 sol in wallet, it will be 1000000000 lamports, but also need to get like $200 or $300. 
Is it impossible?
You can use `Transaction.from` https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#from
this is tangentially related to dev support, but it would be awesome if there was a channel here to looking for solana developers for projects. just something like "looking for team" channel
Safe to usually just go with latest
Most frameworks do this -- remove unneeded complexity with writing code.
Anchor, as a framework, removes a lot of the complexity of working with Solana Programs. However, it can cause issues when you want to do something complex and have no idea what's going on under the hood. Anchor also does a lot of the account security checks that make your program secure by default, which is great.

We're trying to create more resources for solana native right now, it just takes a lot longer. 

Ultimately you can write programs a lot quicker with Anchor, especially if you know what you're doing already under the hood.

Hello Solana people, I would like to start hacking on the Solana codebase itself (not Solana programs), do you have some intro docs, videos, etc? the ones that you would typically give to your new dev hires.

Hi everyone
<@!534091595759222784> did you figure out your architecture for your project?

How to do enums with anchor
I got it but how to write it with anchor?
I'm testing a NFT staking program and I need to test using NFTs not SOL tokens
Hey how can I test with NFT tokens and not just airdropping dev sol
this sounds like a custom implementation. where in order to render the contents of the page you want to check for 1) a wallet 2) a token balance in a given token, then render the page accordingly.
Hello, Can anyone point me to where I can read about integrating an SPL token into my website (have certain pages require SPL token ownership to be viewable)?
Does Solana allow multi-line descriptions?
Then the lamports quantity does not change when I generate a new tx?
I keep getting ```Unhandled Rejection (WalletSignTransactionError): Transaction cancelled ```
you can take a look at https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/runtime#policy
I think so, but I see in doc section# Starting a Validator , i need to connect it to public host rate-limited.. Just I can't get it.
Hey Guys, I'm passing an account chat_account to my program, and chat_account is owned by my program id, so only my program can change the data of that account. Is it possible to change owner of chat_account to some other program id without deleting data of chat_account?
you can get rid of rate limit if you build your own validator.
if i build my personal node and connect it to public server, so there is a limit ?

I dont understand those 2 informations :
here is the rate limit https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints#rate-limits
in doc, i see to connect clustor of Solana solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com etc... so that's mean that im limited by this public server rates ?
Yeah we are looking into ways to migrate all of our PDA accounts over to a newly deployed program with a higher account size.
I know what you mean. you want remain origin program id and just substitute the program data. Unfortunately I don't find any way to change the origin program data account... üò¢ 
maybe you post an issue to github.
if you build your own validator, there is no rate limit anymore.
you can take a look here https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program
How can I tell if my program is upgradable or not?
The question is whether or not there is any way to redeploy a program with a larger program data account to support our new size. "Migrating" the program is a super large undertaking and not something we can do. Is it possible to just change the program to use a different program data account similar to this? https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program#using-an-intermediary-buffer-account
is it possible to run live endpoint on VPS or dedicated server or AWS, which are not fully powerful but can make 100K RPC per day ?
We know our new program is larger than the program data size which is why we are getting the error
FYI
there are all instructions of loader, seems there are no way to upgrade origin data account
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/loader_upgradeable_instruction.rs#L5
there is the error you encounter
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/programs/bpf_loader/src/lib.rs#L605
Thanks ideally we could just increase the size of the program data account. Or else make a NEW program data account and change our program account to point to that new program data account. However both operations don't appear to be supported in any documentation.
sorry, I'm not sure with that but if you got `ProgramData account not large enough`, seems you have to migrate your program.
I'm not pretty sure. Will dig into it and let you know.
Thank you!!
if you are just testing, you can use local validator.
$500/mo is too expensive for what i'm testing üò¶
if you are an upgradable program, you can upgrade it.
only if your size become too large (default is 2 times of your original program) that you will need to deploy to a new program id
or https://www.rpcpool.com/#/ maybe
we usually use ATA as token account which is a deterministic address but actually you can create a random account and init it as a token account.
in the other words you can have not only one token account for the same token.
you can take a look at here https://solanacookbook.com/recipes/token.html#create-token-account
sure. you can take a loo at https://jstarry.notion.site/Transaction-Fees-f09387e6a8d84287aa16a34ecb58e239
Just tried 1 SOL 0.1, 0.01, 0.001.  Same error
<@!788215642070581289> Our program size has now become bigger than what we have in the program data account. We are getting the error `ProgramData account not large enough` which can be seen in this TX: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3BaZHyzqWbJEH5njJrSBXe5SUPUcN2TKSBv2uoJp5U4sQ6wBRyoNpLpjbNnKDTUz8zPkDYv1CM1w45CkLnhFqSVL

Running `solana program deploy --commitment finalized --program-id $PROGRAM_ID ./$DEPLOYED_PROGRAM_PATH` is what got us the original error which has been your response for fixing this error in the past. Is there any way to change our program to use a new program data account with a larger size? We tried closing a program account and redeploying to the same address but that doesn't work either. We just need to increase the size of the program data account. Cant redeploy to new accounts because of PDA's that will no longer be owned by the new program.
Are you trying to do something like this:

import type {Connection} from '@solana/web3.js';
import {PublicKey} from '@solana/web3.js';

export async function loadAccount(
  connection: Connection,
  address: PublicKey,
  programId: PublicKey,
): Promise<Buffer> {
  const accountInfo = await connection.getAccountInfo(address);
  if (accountInfo === null) {
    throw new Error('Failed to find account');
  }

  if (!accountInfo.owner.equals(programId)) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid owner: ${JSON.stringify(accountInfo.owner)}`);
  }

  return Buffer.from(accountInfo.data);
}
Awe I see what you are doing using publickey from web3. I was tryna convert from buffer myself
I'm trying to figure out how to get these parameters from any arbitrary token swap program:

For example: If I have the public key of the pool, how do I get the other addresses here, and the nonce etc 

export const solUsdcPool: OrcaPoolParams = Object.freeze({
  address: new PublicKey("EGZ7tiLeH62TPV1gL8WwbXGzEPa9zmcpVnnkPKKnrE2U"),
  nonce: 252,
  authority: new PublicKey("JU8kmKzDHF9sXWsnoznaFDFezLsE5uomX2JkRMbmsQP"),
  poolTokenMint: new PublicKey("APDFRM3HMr8CAGXwKHiu2f5ePSpaiEJhaURwhsRrUUt9"),
  poolTokenDecimals: 6,
  feeAccount: new PublicKey("8JnSiuvQq3BVuCU3n4DrSTw9chBSPvEMswrhtifVkr1o"),
  tokenIds: [Tokens.solToken.mint.toString(), Tokens.usdcToken.mint.toString()],
  tokens: {
    [Tokens.solToken.mint.toString()]: {
      ...Tokens.solToken,
      addr: new PublicKey("ANP74VNsHwSrq9uUSjiSNyNWvf6ZPrKTmE4gHoNd13Lg"),
    },
    [Tokens.usdcToken.mint.toString()]: {
      ...Tokens.usdcToken,
      addr: new PublicKey("75HgnSvXbWKZBpZHveX68ZzAhDqMzNDS29X6BGLtxMo1"),
    },
  },
  curveType: CurveType.ConstantProduct,
  feeStructure: {
    traderFee: Percentage.fromFraction(25, 10000),
    ownerFee: Percentage.fromFraction(5, 10000),
  },
});
That part must be handled by the orcaSDK because in the config file are the public key strings, and the SDK appears to use web3.js to convert those into the correct RPC calls
I‚Äôm doing typescript too. Just not sure how to convert to solana buffer format from public key string
Thanks for the response, for clarity what I'm trying to do is to generalize the orcaSDK so I could use it to interact with any solana token swap program. 

The way Orca appears to work is based on a list of addresses for each pool in a config file: https://github.com/orca-so/typescript-sdk/blob/642be4139545afe57f8cd722d6035a5614930702/src/constants/pools.ts

So my thinking is, if I can find a way to generate the addresses in the config file for any token swap program, I can plug those into the orca SDK and it would work.
I can‚Äôt just plug in a string into topubkey?
Hello! If I'm creating a project of around 5,555 generated NFTs how much would "Rent" and "Gas" be?

do you know if there is a way to get transactions by (account) public key?
mhm, i know that page already, thank you. Maybe i need another solution.
These are the current available things you can subscribe to: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#subscription-websocket
If what you are looking to accomplish is not there, you'll need to look at the API to get what you want and then have something drive the call at a frequency you need.
but is it possible to see all TX of a (program)account as subscription?
ok, i don't have that üòÑ
For Q1: To deserialize you need to look at the program source to see how/what it serializes.
Feels like a complete noob question, but...

I am trying to "monitor" a program account and analyze it's transactions with JS. Currently i have the function onProgramAccountChange from @solana/web3.js. Not sure if it is the best one. With this I get the program data which i am not able to deserialize.
Two questions: 
1. What's the best way of deserializing?
2. How to get to the transaction information? Or is there a better thing to subscribe to?
Well what is another way to do it?
What‚Äôs the context folder for?
The wallet reacter libraries are all outdated and im getting a ton of dependency errors
The wallet does not work when add sendtransaction
Who‚Äôs in charge of github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold ?
Hey all, figured I'd come here because the anchor discord is broken. I'm building my first anchor program and running into problems with testing it. I've made changes to my Rust program and attempted to re-build and deploy the changes to devnet, but am not seeing the changes and debugging messages I put into the program in the transactions I send to it. What's the best way to tweak and test anchor programs? Can you change them once they're uploaded to Solana? Or do you need to create a net new account for them every time
Hello, do you have suggestion for best node I can buy ? (tested quicknode but not really satisfied)
Hello üëã , Is it possible that 2 tokens account has one owner of the same token ? It appears so https://solscan.io/tx/2oSwbmmf2pcL6XUi4wfuVH1Mnn4aHKzdDD9novMxNeew7PR348hKfBSdpuyi68UBVD3L4FCKvEq4K3iaLTQuR4QA?cluster=devnet
I thought account to token account for a given token address was a deterministic operation, am I wrong ?
Thank you for the response! Is there a calculator for how much would the "rent" and "gas" be?
Yes, at some point the cost to store/serialize entries will exhaust your budget as it takes more and more cycles.
People have opted to 'spawn' a new PDA for the entry versus centralizing the mapping. I haven't done this but others here can advise...
I'm experimenting a problem. My program checks that a pair of data doesn't exists and insert it in the BTreeMap, if exists, throws an error. The problem is that I'm seeing that everytime I store a new pair in BTreeMap, the program consume more computer units. It's incremental, until after 90-100 transactions it start to fail because always reach 200.000 computed units. Any thoughts????? Someone experimented the same problem????
inspired from this, is it possible to make puppet master to deploy as many as puppet's which all own by the puppet-master
https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/tutorials/tutorial-3.html
Heyya! can program deploy another program ?
yes. you will be charged by `rent` and `gas`
if you have installed solana cli tool, you can use `solana rent <data byte length>`
to get the number
Thank you, I think that i didnt incorporate the rent cost for the candy machine config. I understand that uploading a 5.5k collection would cost almost 9sol would this be correct?
Hello! I have a question about smart contracts for minting NFTs on Solana, do we need to pay for anything when launching a smart contract? I‚Äôm sorry for the noob question but in Ethereum there‚Äôs a fee that you need to pay to launch it and I was wondering if Solana has one too.
what is the current cheapest method to mint a 10k NFT collection? how much does it cost $$? -- i'm using the candymachine if anyone is familiar
If you need an associative structure in your program account data, then yes: BTreeMap is the way to go
Hi everyone, I'm developing a Solana program and I need to do the same that I do with a mapping in Solidity. Is BTreeMap a good solution or do I need to look for anything else????
I've looked around, but there is no `StakeAccount` type.
Maybe there is the schema somewhere?
Hi, I know there is https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getStakeActivation, but I'd like an equivalent that takes the buffer directly. Something like `borsh.deserialize`.
Is there a dao management tool like snapshot labs for solana ?
Hello, how can i connect Escrow smart contract to a react app?
For compound data types, borsh prepends the serialized data with 4 bytes (u32) to typically indicate counts, length, etc. Here is their specification: 
https://borsh.io/
yes..
You are asking why borsh prepends 4 bytes to the 'serialized' memory segment?
i'm always having 4 extra bytes when i encode the above struct. and i think i asked before why does it do that but i didn't get an answer.
and if you kindly explain what you mean by this that'd be great!
these are the program logs.
```41 Web 3 console log
Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: Failed to serialize or deserialize account data: Unknown 
    Program 67bG7RM4jcKedxcVJArRYEoqkESzzjptsi7kWy4yiPFv invoke [1]

    Program 67bG7RM4jcKedxcVJArRYEoqkESzzjptsi7kWy4yiPFv failed: Failed to serialize or deserialize account data: Unknown```
even the data length for both sides is equal
Borsh encodes a u32 length prefix for certain data constructs
Whenever I build with cargo. This is what I get
solana_genesis-b887baf53af90acd.exe is infected with Gen:Variant.Razy.985422 and was moved to quarantine. It is recommended that you run a System Scan to make sure your system is clean.   ???
the ```Vec<Pubkey>``` takes 36 bytes? Vec 4 bytes?
Can also check like this https://github.com/SushantChandla/sol-stream-program/blob/d0d537889b155d16fa3c0879e61e4f68c3d47f07/src/state.rs#L43
Here is a 'mockup' where you encode the length of the vector into your data area, get the slice of this size from the vector area and use that.
https://gist.github.com/FrankC01/b03937c5e8c74753eb552ca1e15ba8f8
It's the ol' variable length encoding trick
Check the size and set it when you create account (PDA)
```const Counter = new Map([
    [Counter,
        {
            kind: 'struct',
            fields: [
                ['counter', 'u32'],
                ['is_initialized', 'u8'],
                ['tokenAddress', ['pubkey']]

            ]
        }
    ],
]);```
this is the schema for that.
so how can i avoid this and use try_from_slice because i don't want to rely on the try_from_slice_unchecked as i am unable to trust that.
You need to include the account in the account meta block you pass in to your instruction
When you setup the account I'm sure you allocated enough data to hold the largest `address` vector
The length of your allocated data area is encoded in the `&[u8]` you are deserializing and the `try_from_slice` checks THAT size with how much actual data it deserialized. When they don't match ... kaboom!
`...unchecked()` avoids that test
Hey everybody,
```rust
pub struct Counter {
    /// number of greetings
    pub counter: u32,
    is_initialized: bool,
    address: Vec<Pubkey>,
}```
when i use BorshDeserialize::try_from_slice() to deserialize this struct it fails but if i call it with borsh::try_from_slice_unchecked() it deserializes it correctly?
https://github.com/hashblock/solana-cli-program-template/blob/main/program/src/instruction.rs#L9
If I wrap SOL into a token, what does that inherently do to the value of that token? Does it take the value of the SOL?
How to implement them I am having trouble implenting them. Can you help with any example code.
Enums are supported in Rust, which is what just about everything in Solana is written in
Your program can write to any account data area if THAT account is owned by your program... yes.
Thr alternative is to create a method like this, https://github.com/SushantChandla/sol-stream-program/blob/d0d537889b155d16fa3c0879e61e4f68c3d47f07/src/instruction.rs#L40 
Here I am using the first element of list as tag, then using borsh to deseralize.
Yes, that could be one way to do it.
=> And another question (sorry total different context üòÖ). Is it possible to see the processed data in the smart contract with tools like Solana explorer? E.g. give number in and increase, can I see this
=> Im trying to build a chat app based on Solana. Does anyone have a small code example how to write data to another account with the public key?
Thanks in advance
If not then what is alternate?
Are enums supported in solana??
So every user has their own PDA, plus one central one. Right?
Any account owned by program.

What you have to do make that is create 2 PDA to store data, and write the logic accordingly to update the data of both of them.
EG, if I have a game program. I have an account which interacts with the program and stores my game stats. But there is also an account which stores the global stats for the game. So I run an instruction, it will update my stats, but it also needs to update the "central" account to update the global stats
So can my instruction write to other accounts owned by the program? Or only my own account?
No, you will give the account in the parameters where you want to write the accounts(array). And that account should be owned by Program id
Or only to mine, since I ran the instruction
Yes, but if I run an instruction on my account owned by program X, that it write to all other accounts owned by program X ?
A program can only write to the accounts that are owned by Program.
Can a program write to all accounts that have set it as it's program ID, not just the account calling the instruction?
Hello, How to close a executable program account and get SOL back? I deployed a program on mainnet for testing and now I want to close that program and program data account to get my SOL back, is it possible to close a program id

but I want to print that key in a human readable manner
now if I do 

keypair.secreyKey

of course I get the array
web3.js
I mean, I have generated a keypair with web3
can anyone tell me how can I print a secretKey in the string format in typescript?
hi everyone
here are some code references on staking, 
https://github.com/step-finance/step-staking
https://github.com/project-serum/stake
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/stake-pool (sol but still relevant)
several issues have been filed. if its different from those please file the specific issue.
that would be awesome. most of the video series that start appear to get side tracked by what seem to be personal projects and new job opportunities. would love to a see a whole series! post them here and let us know can offer support and send over users!
Hey guys. I think I should start a series of video tutorials on Solana Dapp development. Let me know if you think if it would be useful. Because I am willing to spend many hours developing videos only if people think it would be useful tool to get them started. Because on youtube right now the Solana dev tutorials are pretty scarce. Let me know what you think and thank you.
Dapp scaffold. Getting a deserializeMint error on fresh install. Fix it
If you were to allow accounts of your program to 'stake' your token:
1. what data structure would you use (for storage)?
2. what are the relevant functions to store data on a program?
3. Thank you!!
the only info i know on voting aside from the validator chats and related is in the Solana docs and code.

you should be able to use the above recommended by jivin, but if nothing else is working you need to make sure you add it to your profile that is getting loaded into terminal, one that gets loaded when terminal loads, for mac m1 its probably zsh. there is also a mac m1 guide that if u do follow from scratch it does work. as a backup.
`export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH`
https://dev.to/nickgarfield/how-to-install-solana-dev-tools-on-an-m1-mac-kfn
here is more info on path and terminal for mac
https://wpbeaches.com/how-to-add-to-the-shell-path-in-macos-using-terminal/
Is there a good writeup about how voting works on Solana, which explains the meaning of "root", confirmed, final, optimistic confirmation, etc.
how can I solve this ?
but when I quite terminal   I should do it again
cd into the solana directory and run this in your terminal
```export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH```
how can I add this on mac?

while deploying a program i am facing an erroy that says

Hi, i was asking me if its someone have worked with unix_timestamp?
Ohh....Thanks!!

wtf, fucking scammers in the server..
hi how do i get the amount of other tokens in my wallet?
I‚Äôm creating a program that allows users to write. Meaning they can input variables such as text or number and then approve the contract to create or send a message to the program to execute an order such a deliver the message.

This is possible correct ?
Hello devs and team members back to bother you with another Question
ahh thats different.  so how it has worked, is that when you deploy originally, the account used is twice the size of the original deploy by default, to leave room for upgrade, but if you specify max length, usually in anticipating the 'max size' you can set it to be even bigger (or smaller)  after deployment the max len is locked permanently if I recall, so either way, if it grew so much it went pass the specified size, or the allocated default, you are probably out of luck..
Thanks for the reply. I haven't marked it as `final` deploy and I also have authority to redeploy, but while deploying my program I set the --max-len to 100_000 and now my program size become around 130_000, and I'm not able to redeploy my program. I'm getting this error `ProgramData account not large enough`  Is there any way I can increase program data size so that I can redeploy my program to the same program id. I have keypair for my current program id. Or any other way to deploy to same program id
i would just try locally, and or in dev. if I recall, the same keypair/id can be used to continue to deploy, and u can still transfer authority and deploy. im not aware of any specific close related to a program Id specifically, in which case just start using another ones. the only way something cannot be deployed that I recall is if there was a freeze making it a 'final' deploy. and or u no longer have the authority in some regard.
not really sure what you mean. if using the built in token swap they use the ids inside the program, including token-swap and token program Ids, and then you have to pass the ids for the other things. in all cases the ids you pass in should be known. the token-swap program, in github also has tests you can follow.
If I close the current program id and deploy again to the same program id as I have keypair for the program id, will my program vaults, accounts that my program own and PDA will work same as before or is this can create a problem after deploying again to same program id after closing. Any help would be appreciated. Thank You.
Would really appreciate any help to point me in the right direction

the best place for metaplex questions and support is the metaplex forum.   0x1 from what i remember usually does mean insufficient funds, unless your getting another custom error. if you can somehow do verbose logging or do extra logging in someway for your metaplex calls that may help. in either case, u should probably try adding more funds, at least to accounts that might be paying for the funding. im not sure how accurate the arweave calculator is, or if it takes into account all combined fees that may be charged, including the native sol standard signature fees.
hey guys! I'm trying to upload to arweave using metaplex, however i am getting an error saying that I have insufficient lamports and that that there is a custom program error: 0x1. I have used the arweave calculator to calculate my fees which would be roughly 0.002sol, I have sufficient funds for this in my wallet. I read that people had issues when uploading due to the metadata not being standard, I have checked that my metadata includes "symbol" and all the needed requirements. I have also made sure that my files start with 0.json, 0.png, 1.json, 1.png, etc...

I think you can dig into the source code. you don't give signer you disable sigVerify

Sorry if I‚Äôm missing something obvious - didn‚Äôt find anything via google search or discord search. 

Is it safe to use a Vector for dynamic array sizing to hold data In an account? 

The context is let‚Äôs say I want to collect messages from a user - the size is unknown. 

Would the chat app demo be a good one to follow to take learnings from or is this a bad design?
but here you're transferring using system program transfer lamports, and then just using sync native to sync the wrapped token account to underlying sol balance
ie usually you're transferring using the token program transfer function between token accounts of same mint
From what I can see in the code you link, it means I can treat the wrapped token account as the source or target of a transfer as long as I call sync native after the transfer?
Thanks <@!785084693023424542>, I've really struggled to understand what the sync native command does (looked at both docs and code).
the standard practice from what I have seen has always been to wrap and unwrap SOL to send and transfer.  are you aware of the SyncNative feature?   if your wrapping or sending lamports or SOL you should be able to transfer and syn, with the account, to update the SOL/WSOL account/balance.  not sure on your exact implementation but you may be able to use this. but  you should be able to transfer lamports, and just sync the account
https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-program-library/blob/doc-upgrade/docs/src/token.mdx 
`// Transfer SOL to associated token account and use SyncNative`
(I'm doing all of this via web3 FWIW)
But I was wondering if there's any other way to transfer in / out of a WSOL token account without a create / close?
Team, I've got a use case where I'd prefer to have a 'long term' wrapped SOL account, probably the native mint ATA, with the majority of my SOL in there. I know how to get funds in there when creating the account (ie wrapping SOL) and how to get funds out when closing the account (ie unwrapping SOL)
metaplex is a good example of how they did a marketplace and the source code is available. it depends what u 'needn' on chain, what is already accessible on chain of what u need, and then what u actually need to really store on chain, vs off chain. 

There are several dashboards and services popping up to get existing data, like say a users wallets and accounts, and or NFTs, from on chain already, and whether you use these and send data from those to your app,  or see which source codes are available to see their approaches, or choose to write your own simplified database for on chain data storage, and determine what it necessary, and use airweave/ipfs, or some other distributed storage, cloud storage, or traditional storage for other info, is up to you. for each specific thing you want to do, see whats needed from on chain/off chain, what already exists, if you want to use that, or create your own resource, and go from there.
this repo for example has lots of helper functions, some related to updating meta data, as an example: included in the links:
https://github.com/samuelvanderwaal/metaboss
Thanks for sharing the info, i think theres some options here and I will dig deeper into the external solutions to see if I want to use those instead. 

If you don't mind me asking a follow up question - is there any architecture designs that we can read about. Say a Marketplace DApp - structuring the main feed to search and display items. A users profile etc. 

It seems like we would need tons of accounts to hold some of these info and I am struggling to wrap my head around this and come to a solution without using some centralized storage to make it easier
Ok, i will try to understand how it works.
the discord link contains like to meta data related tools, including for token and NFT metadata, mints, looking up mints, minting, lookups, searching, airdrops, accounts, and much more. the explorer also has started showing meta data and have source code.
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/886259112105635940/886269376196657172
looks at the links, and the others in metaplex community docs section, lots of tools and resources and explainers are available.
for associating your generally speaking of either getting, updating, or somehow linking other metadata to existing data.  the resources should have all those, in several forms. I would spend some time and you can find what your looking for.
'wrapped' solana is SPL-Token, so unless Crypto.com has an SPL support, probably not.  and do u mean Fantom or Phantom wallet, that was built for Solana? in either case, unless it was not unwrapped it should still be in SOL and not WSWOL. Generally you would unwrap any already wrapped SOL. You could also use an exchange like FTX which greatly simplifies the wrap and send portion if you cant figure it out otherwise.  in a worst case you can test an extremely small amount to see if it succeeds, which u always want to do before sending anyway, to verify it works. If your sending SOL from PHANTOM wallet, you should be able to send to another SOL address.
I want to mint 10 NFT's and add metadata to it. ("simple" as that) without using UI.
Without all the boiler plate for UI minting and store fronts.
So, is there any tool on metaplex that associates metadata to a minted token in a simple way?
hey all. devs please help. can wrapped Solana be sent to Solana address??? Using FANTOM wallet going to Crypto.com
right if you use the discord search on getProgramAccounts, you will notice several implementations of 'filters' used. 
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/911552199857946635
so you can filter content, but if the protocol or account you are querying has something more complex, it might be difficult to know or figure out, without consulting them. many will help in their discord if your trying to interface or query a protocol.  also the other resources for graph, solana.fm, aleph, and others.. also have ways to make easier and help query on certain data.
When you use 

```
    /**
     * Fetch all the accounts owned by the specified program id
     *
     * @return {Promise<Array<{pubkey: PublicKey, account: AccountInfo<Buffer>}>>}
     */
    getProgramAccounts(
```

Is there a way for you to know / filter the accounts ? 

I.e what if your program has accounts to handle token transfers, some to hold data, and others to process data?
thank you!
did you ever figure this out?
when starting the test validator are there known issues wit hteh validator crashing when the genesis state is unapcked?

i keep getting a test validator crashing right after the genesis unpack is started:


```

```
<@785084693023424542> thank you very much
no problem. its always better to be proactive. just letting you know.
let me have a look at it
by capturing log data and filtering the data you need, or inquiring with those protocols, and seeing what resources they have for capturing that data, possibly through solana.fm, graph, and other protocols as well. thats for current data.  out of the box there is no 'simple' mechanism for simply subscribing to protocols updates, because they are all custom.
I know I'm writing so much I'm really sorry about that but I'm very excited about my project
same answer atm. it is being reviewed and eco system is in process of being updated.
for traditional SPL-Tokens the token list is how you can add basic supported meta data, 
https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list
for NFTs the Metaplex standard is used:

is it possible to stream all deposit/withdraw/swap transactions via solana-web3 from platforms like Raydium/Orca/Saber?
Can someone explain me where can i find information about how to add metadata to tokens?
Hello there!
O so it is possible to fetch all the accounts for a program Accounts ? Can you filter or sort the accounts that are returned ?
like what if there are thousands of results, is there any way to page the response?
does anyone know what the limit is on getProgramAccounts?
Hello again when will the solana-labs/ecosystem merged projects will be added into the solana ecosystem website
So if programs have to own accounts 

And a single DApp could have multiple accounts to store various data 

How exactly does someone associate an account to a specific user versus for the entire app? 

How would you go about fetching these different types of accounts ?
Thanks mate!!!
hard to say why your timing out, im not very familiar with that script or candy machine. you might try a different RPC end point if thats possible, or launching the call from a different client/proxy or source to see if its related to your client/ip/source.
hey guys. I've been in the metaplex server trying this for hours, tried every possible thing you can imagine, and I have had no luck. 

Tried with RPC
tried without RPC 
tried on gitpod etc. 

I am running this code...

*All i'm trying to do is get my SOL back with the* **withdraw** __command__

``` npx ts-node js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts withdraw --env mainnet-beta --keypair ./humbleroobeachclub-mainnet.json ```

**But it is not working. **

I have tried over 90 times, (not kidding)

I am receiving timeout errors, over and over and over again. How do I stop the d*mn timeouts?

can someone help?

Do you have some resources around the topic NFTs and programs?
Something other than all the stuff from the solana docs?
Agreed!
the funny thing is that a 'smart contract' was just a made up catchy buzzword that took off, and program is actually more appropriate. but I admit that the term smart contract is fun, has stuck, and can make sense too üôÇ
I already thought of something like this. But do not know where to start.

Getting a NFT collection and uploading it on the network is not the difficult part. Having some kind of program that interacts with the NFT sucks
i agree, a lot of the naming conventions are so confusing to me
same
Kinda feel weird about saying program instead of smart contracts
unfortunately not
I just started learning two days ago
Do you have some resources that go into depth around the topic of nfts and smart contracts on solana?
Doing something each day - sounds like we need a Cron job (probably in NodeJS and use the Solana JS SDK?) that can call into your Program. 

The NodeJS Script probably also has to do the fetching of users you would like to give money to. 

The program would then likely need to be able to transfer funds from a PDA account to each users public key (checking it only happens once every 24 hours?)
Hi guys,
I have a broad understanding about smart contracts and I have viewed some examples. But I still do not know how to make a smart contract for example that gives out some coins to holders each day.
How should i do something like this. Can someone please give me a broad understanding on how I should implement that?
Is the program_id something that the client can fetch, or should it just be fetched from the package.json metadata?
<:confuse:585605260563972109>
im repeatedly running into issues with the localnet validator being unable to start if i add certain lines of code and im not sure whats up.

im working on a function that invokes an spl token program transfer method, and adding `token::transfer(cpi_ctx, transfer_amount)?;` causes the validator to fail to start with the error:

```
Error: failed to start validator: Failed to create ledger at .anchor/test-ledger: blockstore error
```

commenting out that `token:transfer` method fixes the issue
We are paying nice salaries
Is anyone interested?

hi can someone please provide me link or some suggestion on this ?
yes please
Would be happy to start a DM with you guys so we can discuss design details together and help each other with what we learn
<@!132687814017024000> <@!900398103084023858> Man you gave me more to think about that i planned but i definitely want to keep it all on chain and eventually have it decentralised. Just re-thinking traditional approaches to system design
For me, it's a lot of trial and error
Yeah, I understand. I mean, I'm going through the same thing. It's a whole new world.
For sure the latter, I am having a hard time visualizing / know what approach to have in system design to keep track of this info & how on the front end to fetch this info.
I mean, if your data is stored on-chain, there is a fee for creating/updating it. It's going to be very small. A few cents on average, I'd imagine -- or less -- depending on the size of the data, but would you rather have a world where companies leech off people like parasites by selling their information to advertisers just so they can say that their services are "free" or would you prefer people just pay directly and live in a more transparent, honest digital world?
üôÉ
How do I fetch tokens except than solana from the wallet ??
Philosophically, I think that there is a lot of opportunity in Solana in constructing new business models and product design paradigms based on charging minuscule amounts for user actions, like posting things. So much data out there stored and duplicated in data centers is complete garbage. Useless old posts and pictures of the same thing, like pizza, some building, some trite platitude. Think about all the crap on IG and FB.
I mean, you can definitely create a hybrid application. However, the question becomes one of how important it is (and for what reasons) that the data be decentralized and possibly ephemeral as well as how you want to charge users for actions in the app.
Yeah this part of the system design does not have a clear answer. 

I‚Äôm trying to find an answer to this as well. 

You should be able to open source a project even with some of this basic DB storage and it can still be a Decentralized App right? 

It‚Äôs just data mining / displaying data opposed to other aspects imo and it should be fine but idk. Maybe we should use something like Arweave ?
that's what i wondered. Does it make sense to just store this sort of data in a database but then only handle the web3 parts (transactions, signing etc) with Solana rather than trying to save everything on there
Yeah i'd only load the user's posts for their own profile and depending on how many there were definitely paginate. But doing that in web 2 is trivial, storing these on chain and how to load them is what i was trying to work out.

So the idea here is that a user would have many accounts each one storing their post. Then the app would need a way to retrieve all posts from all accounts say on the home page? Say there are 1000 posts/accounts, it would need to fetch say 20 for the first page etc
Is this a paradigm for anytime you need to fetch things for an entire app? 

Would it be bad design to just use a DB with the wallet public key to map to posts/objects? 

This way you can pull specific account_ids mapped to a users wallet and show all user activity / specific user activity
Even if you only had 5MB of posts to load for a user, it would be not good from many perspectives to have an app load all 5MB of posts whenever you visit a user's profile page. It would be better to paginate their posts rather than process and/or load them all at once. Either you can allocate accounts for each individual post or for a number of posts you deem to be considered "one page" of results. If you also keep each post to a fixed max size, then you know up front the cost of each post/page. You'd then need the program to store the address of each post or page or have a way to deterministically reconstruct the addresses using, say, some sequence of seed values when generating your accounts' keys. Just my 2 cents.
Are you asking what method to use to sign a transaction? If so, you add signers upon sending the tx:
```ts
const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(conn, tx, signers);
```


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

this is really helpful. thank you!
Is anyone aware of projects like dxlock or unicrypt etc. that support Solana? To time lock liquidity etc?
if you're only using the web3 for achieving this. you can set the authority of the token account to that wallet address and it should work. i did try this. i minted a token using the CLI wallet and after minting i set the token account authority to my phantom wallet and the NFT showed up there
and all these resources should have or link to the things you need. getting all NFTs on an address, meta data, etc.  https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/886259112105635940/886269376196657172
you'd need to use the getTokenAccountByOwner method of the solana web3 connection class. From there you will get those token accounts of the NFTs held in your wallet then you will have to decode the account data and in it you get the token address. from there you get the metadata account Address by using the method Publickey.findProgramAddress and once you get the metadata account you can decode that to get the on chain metadata for the token. Pretty much that's how it would work like as far as i have tried.
it would be much cleaner if you only had those NFTs in that wallet since you are only requiring those.
sounds like customization, but can probably be done.  users can create as many addresses as they want so you may want some other mechanisms in place. whitelisting or some other features. metaplex related resources may have things like this.
I have several NFTs that I minted in my wallet using candy machine. I now want to be able to programmatically transfer these so some recipient wallets. Is there a way to query for all the nfts in my wallet, get their metadata (i.e., I want to know the name of the token) and transfer to a recipient address? I know I have to create a token account for the recipient but I couldn't find any examples on how to create this if the nft already exists in my wallet.
Is it possible to have a free mint where you can choose how many nfts someone can mint per address. So you allow one guy to mint 1, and another guy his address 5
look this overview, and if needed follow it from scratch as is, it should work.
https://dev.to/nickgarfield/how-to-install-solana-dev-tools-on-an-m1-mac-kfn
ecrow_account and admin_account are accounts i have copied  from the `accounts` array. You can only debit lamports from a PDA in a program. `ecrow_account` is a PDA.
here are some different overview docs consolidated by some community :
https://hackmd.io/@ironaddicteddog/solana-starter-kit#PDA
https://www.notion.so/Solana-Rust-Intro-for-Solidity-Devs-e27d881a14794a3199514336ee032d0c#eb143eaecb5c4ff4a5d7129826df83c8
for entry point, based on the line, they are conditional compilation lines, that may indicate usage based on some state, you can google more about those for rust if you want to know more about how conditional compilation works.
Hi guys, any help?
okay but a little explanation with it would be help me a bit much better
```rust
        **escrow_account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? -= 30000000;
  **admin_account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? += 30000000;
```
if i want to transfer sol to three different account in one transaction do i need to invoke the
```sytem_instruction::transfer``` three time for each wallet or is there any other way
what does that mean if you have the transaction signature. how would you have this, and what transaction are you referring to.  generally youll want to have a list of known mint addresses, and or query an address, and what would you do with getMintInfo.
here is more on fees:

If I have the transaction signature of a mint, is it possible to getMintInfo from it?
Hello, how many are the costs to put a collection on the blockchain ?
Would a dev be interested in being a guest on my Defi podcast?
---
 how do I pass additional values, i.e. the key value into onAccountChangeCallback?
```for (const key in PROGRAM_TOKEN_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS) {
  connection.onAccountChange(ADDRESSES[key], onAccountChangeCallback);
}
function onAccountChangeCallback(accountInfo, context) {
  ...
}```
what you trying todo? there are few things that might work
Hello, is it possible to set-up an "emergency wallet" ? On my minting site, I want the funds to go to a wallet "A", is it possible to add a second wallet "B" just in case the A-wallet has problems ?
Just wondering if there's a way to mint and transfer NFT in one transaction. Can anyone point me to the right direction?
also i was told pda accounts are made on chain by the program using create_program_address(programID,seedphrase) if so what does createAccountWithSeed is used for ?
so i was looking at  one of the spl examples, can any one explain the rust project architechture for example it had 3 files
entrypoint.rs, instruction.rs , processor.rs
what does each file represent
and what does this macro do and why is "#![cfg(not(feature = "no-entrypoint"))] present in the entrypoint.rs file "
Hey folks, I'm looking for Solana smart contract dev.
that corresponds to this line in `run.sh` https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/scripts/run.sh#L93
here's the error I get when running `docker-compose up`:
```localnet_1  | /usr/bin/solana-run.sh: line 120:    79 Killed                  solana-validator "${args[@]}" $SOLANA_RUN_SH_VALIDATOR_ARGS

the Docker image `solanalabs/solana:v1.8.3` was working for me last night but now it fails to start. But according to Docker Hub it was last pushed 17 days ago üòï
Hello, is there a way to already bulk upload a large collection (<1000 NFTs) to Solsea using a smart contract? Are there any workarounds so i can do this? Thank you
Thanks! The airdropped balances were not in the correct deriv path address (m/44'/501'/0'/0') - but inside the default address CLI tool generates for us
do you see your tokens in solana explorer?
works for me ü§î
Doesn't matter much, I just want to know have I done something wrong
Hey, I'm playing around with wallets on devnet with phantom. I do have airdropped some test tokens on my wallets but I cannot see the balances in phantom when I switch the phantom network to `devnet`  is that normal? Is it possible to see the devnet balances on phantom?
hi. i'd like to read a lot of transactions (>10K) using `getParsedConfirmedTransactions` call. which size of batch and interval between batches would be considered unobtrusive?
Is devnet down?
How do I hide NFTs and reveal them after sometime?
Is it possible if I use Metaplex?
Makes sense, thanks. Do you think that it is a matter days/weeks/months?
I'm trying to use get_multiple_accounts() but I don't get the "data": " " at all.
Is there any multiple equivalent of get_token_accounts_by_owner() in python?
we are trying to build a simple game that could exchange the game coin to our token. is that possible? is this the right repo for the smart contract for the game? i would appreciate any insight. thank you! https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold
Lol you guys even made a cli for this? Stake pool cli. Going to remove all the fluff: fees and validators
I'm working on a project that aims to reduce the number of NFTs available over time. At the start of the project, 100 NFTs will be generated, and I want to burn 1 NFT every 24 hours, until only 1 is left. Is it possible for a program to burn an NFT when this NFT is owned by someone else?
It should be possible to trade these NFTs until they are burned.
Nice. Is there a hello world for a simple deposit/withdraw? Only finding one to send a hello
Could someone p point me to example code parsing transaction history
Okay, the thing is, the documentation itself also returns the same thing, how could make it return the information that I do need.
Does anyone know of there is a quick UI to mint NFTs to devnet/testnet
is there an easy way to get the first transaction that has occurred for an address? `getSignaturesFromAddress` starts from the most recent, which makes you write a while loop to get to the first, wondering if there's an obvious method im missing
Hello, could someone please help me out here, trying to build my solana program but keep getting this error
So im going to have to buy the domain and the hosting then.
Thank you
Fork the dapp scaffold and build the site from scratch. Typescript takes just a day to learn
hello! i was just wondering.... does the website matter in a sol contract? What I mean by this is, can I just have a basic wix.com site and run a contract through that. Or what does the website need...
I can just mint new tokens every minute right?
cool. what did you do?
ok thanks I think I figured it out!
the user will have to at least connect once. if your taking about other session, or outside of the page thats a different story.
ok i have this in my code base, so not sure why it still prompts to connect
```
<WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect>
```
ok thanks <@!287328501999075328>
Yeah it's possible - but you'll need to jump through some hoops to prove you are legitimately changing the token address for your name. Then make a PR to change it and then you'll have to find someone to help since it won't auto-merge. So use the PR system and issues to chase it up with them so that they can help üôÇ
if you control the mint, you control the supply. so you can control it however you want..  right?  up to your design.
look at the auto connect feature of the solana  wallet-adapter.
hi there, beginner question here. am building a react frontend, how do you keep a persistent wallet connection? (i.e. user does not need to keep reconnecting when he/she lands on website)
How can I make a solana program with steadily increasing supply like invictus does?
what is your token and protocol?
Can we replace new tokens with same name
okay, but now we have in development and our token in mainet
No, that is the max for that token - you will need to create a new token with `spl-token create-token` and this time add `--decimals` with a smaller number, depending on how many decimals you want.
okay, so I havent yet limit my supply so i can mint more for same SPL token right ?
You will need to create a new mint with less decimals
so u meant to say it is the max supply i can get from SPL
If you want more supply then you need to use less precision... you can only set the precision when you first create the mint account, using the `--decimals` option. Default is 9, see how there are 9 numbers after the decimal point? So you need less decimals for bigger maximum, all the digits stay the same for the max value, only the decimal point moves.
Yeah this is the maximum for 9 decimals
Is there any possible way that I can make the error more verbose than just showing up as 0x4 something like that
and I got only 18446644073.709551615 total supply
these are accurate number
spl-token mint XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 555000000000
Minting 555000000000 tokens
these are accurate number
and I got only 18446644073.709551615 total supply
i mean the error is pretty much self explanatory
so the error is  ```
/// The owner of the input isn't set to the program address generated by the program.
    #[error("Input account owner is not the program address")]
    InvalidAccountOwner
``` in the program  error list.....
spl-token mint XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 555000000000
Minting 555000000000 tokens
those numbers do not look accurate, but if your wanting a higher supply cap youll need to use a different decimal when defining the mint. I dont believe u can change the decimal after the fact. assuming this is a token (mint) you created and are trying to mint. if u did this with CLI look at the --help and decimals, less, is more?
some context would be good. its a custom program error.. it can depend on the program. otherwise, its likely the 5th error in your programs error enum, if the program has one..
Are those numbers right? Do you group numbers in 2s and 3s in your locale? Can't quite understand.
Hi, i have minted 5,000,00,00,000 SPL token but only 200,00,00,000 Token generated, why it so? could anyone help me to understand?
im getting this error

hi guys, how do i get more details on the errors that I get for fail transaction ??
yep, if it happens again i will be careful to try to reproduce
thanks
curious if it happens again.
I will post an update if I run into/fix the issue
yes it was quite frustrating since i was not getting an error
bizarre.
I rebooted the box and that seems to have fixed the issue
this is a fresh ubuntu 20.04. Yes that is the complete log. I tried running with -r. Interesting thing is it ran okay once, then i killed it, then after that it killed itself immediately during init.
thats the end of the log?  no error or anything else?  have you tried running with any flags, or -v verbose logging? what kind of setup is this?
here is the validator log
if an account's owner is "11111111111111111111111111111111" that means it's owned by the system program. I expect that your query is returning the wrong type of account
it's a very new feature, and we need to wait for all validators upgrade before turning it on
oh I misunderstood the situation. I think it was deleted momentarily due to some CI/CD configuration. I didn't realize that your PR was on that repo, it should be moved to the monorepo if you don't mind!
what are some reasons why it might do that?
Im running solana-test-validator but on Initializing it stops running after a few seconds
<:tinfoilhat:809110749141663754>
anyone that a program gives authority to can write data to the file, its based on the program.
the simplest example is probably the record program. and in the case of write you generally pass as a signer or sign in addition to a payer.
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/record/program
i dont have issues running on either.
if your on mac m1 and nothing is working try this, following it exactly. should work
https://dev.to/nickgarfield/how-to-install-solana-dev-tools-on-an-m1-mac-kfn

on ubuntu you may have to do package updates and make sure the distro is up to date, and follow the install recs and instructions related to linux. but it should overall be the smoothest.
maybe: https://pyth.network/
It‚Äôs possible to create a program that lets signee * write ? Am I correct. In this situation the signer could write on the contract ?
I beg of you
Ser‚Äôs
For example, right now on my Ubuntu I'm facing this problem:

```
$ solana-test-validator
--faucet-sol argument ignored, ledger already exists
Ledger location: test-ledger
Log: test-ledger/validator.log
‚†Ç Initializing...
Aborted (core dumped)
```
What's the most stable distro to do Solana development on? My main machine is an M1 mac that seems to have some issues in general (expected), but also seeing some problems with my old Ubuntu 18.04 on an Intel Xeon E5. Would I have better luck with a newer Ubuntu/Debian?
I think there should be things in "data".
{
                "data": [
                    "",
                    "base64"
                ],
                "executable": false,
                "lamports": 164795728,
                "owner": "11111111111111111111111111111111",
                "rentEpoch": 251
            },
I think I'm using get_multiple_accounts() right in python, and I'm not getting any data, is it a bug or is it like this and I have to do something else?
Is there a good solution to access a custom dataset to run within a SPL program? Chain link isn‚Äôt on Solana yet besides financial data unfortunately.
why ed25519 is not enabled?
I see that its disabled `E1TvTNipX8TKNHrhRC8SMuAwQmGY58TZ4drdztP3Gxwc | inactive | enable builtin ed25519 signature verify program`
is `Ed25519SigVerify111111111111111111111111111` available to programs to call? I'm calling it in a similar way this code does (https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/src/ed25519_instruction.rs) it it seems like signature verification always passes without triggering a program error, regardless if the signature is valid or not.
That repo is now included within the monorepo
The explorer uses the coingecko API, I'm sure similar sites have APIs as well
hey guys - this doesn't really belong here, but is anyone aware of an API that lets you query SOL prices by date+time?
okay, thank you :)
How they do that in python
But u need to go through the python doc and figure it out..
So its javascript u would create new pubkey for the address like new Publickey(mintaddressoftoken)
how do I get that?
Mint*
Same with the token min address
mine in this case
And then convert that into pubkey type
yes
Yes but u need to pass the address  of the account u checking the tokens in
doing that outputs {'jsonrpc': '2.0', 'error': {'code': -32602, 'message': 'Invalid param: Token mint could not be unpacked'}, 'id': 1}
But u need to check how python does it for ya
Yes solana web3.js has class called pubkey to generate new pubkey out of those address
Might need to look a bit more y its showing connection error.
something like that?
pub_key = PublicKey("")
mint_account = "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"
print(solana_client.get_token_accounts_by_owner(pub_key,TokenAccountOpts(mint=mint_account)))
And you need the wallet address and mint address of that token. After that create pub key for those address and pass that as a parameter to the function getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner
and it takes me out of my SOL value so I guess that's good.
no connection error
If that's how u make the connection with python, then yes
I'm doing it in python yes
?
Is this like python wrapper around sol web3
client = Client("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com ") this?
Thats one of the methods that they have
Yes but u have set up the connection and everything already?
I found that I think I need to use this .get_token_accounts_by_owner
ok
Lol so u need to check out the web3  library for solana first
but I have to do it for a discord bot.
it would also help me to get all the people who have any amount of a particular token and the amount they have.
Go through solana Explorer  n chuck in the address there
this
or just in general u have this address and u just wanna check their account ?
??
like you trying to get their wallet token amount when they are connected
If I'm honest I have no idea
and like spl token ?
u using web3 to this ?
to retrieve the amount ?
is there any more simple solution for this?
Hi so I was trying to get the spl token amount from my wallet. but when i could only access those value through this
```js
token amount = res.value[0].account.data.parsed.info.tokenAmount.uiAmountString
```
Paulx blog is a beast

Hello, how many are the costs to put a collection on the blockchain ?
I'm new to Solana development, and trying to figure out if there's a good channel for noob questions - would this be it or is there a better place?
I'm doing it in python
that's mine
HqfvwA8fR53KCw5KbG2Hf19iYfXCxJqn2pJ8rK9rexcc
I want to do one thing, I want to know the amount of a specific token that a person has, knowing his public address, I have been trying several things but I am lost.
?
does anyone have any good resources about getting started with writing programs for solana in rust
Why history in this repo was deleted? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js

oh sure I will check that out. Thanks heaps.
you may want to double check the keys in an explorer or make sure they are pointing to what you think they are, and based on what you need from the call, you may want to use this version, getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner
with the same wallet pub key
weird its fetching my sol balance from the wallet tho...
thanks heaps you bloody legend m8
ohh i found the error lol... my wallet pub key is returning undefined ..
did u check the value of MY_TOKEN and wallet.publicKey?    to make sure they are valid PublicKeys?  id check those and log the value first, to make sure they work.
<@!788215642070581289> Hello, I have started with Solana, for the moment everything is fine, but I have a question and I will be grateful if you could help me, has someone used the slots or unix_timestamp to obtain the real time?
due to that error
and i was trying to check the value on console log, but its says the promise has been rejected ...
you probably want to head over to the validator and related channels for those types of questions, <#560174212967432193> . I recall this tutorial, if your asking how to setup and try to build a validator. otherwise you may want to check the other channels.
https://github.com/agjell/sol-tutorials/blob/master/setting-up-a-solana-devnet-validator.md#setting-up-a-solana-devnet-validator
and my token has the mint address value inside it
something like this.
```js
 let value = await this.connection.getTokenAccountsByOwner(this.$wallet.publickey, {mint: new PublicKey(MY_TOKEN)});  
```
so lets say
what does your code look like?  but an error like that means watever your calling toBase58 on is undefined.. you might be trying to cast to something   mykeyString.toBase58  and mykeyString is undefined, has no value.
Hello, to build a node and ask foundation stake, how many SOL you need to have already?
hmm
I think the only paid part of metaplex is the storefront. If you don‚Äôt use that then the rest is free afaict
any idea why its showing me up that error?
hi, i came across a error when I was trying to fetch my spl token from the wallet?
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toBase58') at Connection.getTokenAccountsByOwner
Only thing that costs money is actual on-chain storage and arweave storage
Oh - you mean use the source but not the service? I thought you were saying you were gonna use metaplex.
How do you mean? All open source as far as I can tell
(or are willing to pay money to save time - which is usually the right thing to do)
Oh also arweave in there somewhere
Fair enough - it'll cost more but you'll get there much quicker, so that's the right choice if you've got more money than time. üôÇ
Esp. since there is comparatively a lot of existing tooling around this stack
And obviously any of that can be hand rolled‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm interested in getting things working with pre-existing solutions before going the bespoke implementation route
Basically: Metaplex candy machine for everything contract side, including this subsystem(?) called gumdrop for managing whitelists. Then looking to any number of candy machine compatible frontend templates as a starting point for integration. And any number of image+metadata generator programs to actually _create_ the assets attached to the NFTs created by candy machine.
ü§£ - you know what I mean. And you will get there, you're smart! If you want to whiteboard anything out I'd be happy to pair on it, I'm still learning plenty so can't promise to be much more than a rubber duck. ü¶Ü

Do anchor handles enums differently than vanilla solana program??


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

For some reason, my ts function outputs a completely different derived address than intended
any TS/Rust experts can verify this would be the TS equivalent right...?
I have a really Odd problem, one of my friend was having issue to send a Metaplex Nft from his Phantom wallet(let‚Äôs say A wallet)  to another(B wallet). It was giving him the error ‚ÄúUnable to send‚Äù then he sent me the nft which I received to my wallet, and when I sent him the nft from my wallet to his B wallet the Nft went back to his A wallet, even though the transaction notification said it was successfully sent. We tried this couple of times and both times it went back to him A wallet. I even tried to send it to my other wallet which worked but anytime I send it to the B wallet it goes back to A wallet. How is this possible?? How can he rectify this? Thanks a lot in advance for the help.
Hey thanks for the response. Wondering if there's a code snippet where I can play with this approach you mentioned. What I'm trying to do is a "Mint" button that mints an NFT. Just like Candy Machine starter template does
does this look right? I'm trying to require users to have to pay some SOL when calling a custom instruction
```
  const instruction = new TransactionInstruction({
    keys: [{ pubkey: accountId, isSigner: false, isWritable: true }],
    programId: config.REWARD_POOL_PROGRAM,
    data: createInstructionData(),
  })
  const transaction = new Transaction().add(instruction)
  transaction.feePayer = provider.publicKey

  // include the fee
  transaction.add(
    SystemProgram.transfer({
      fromPubkey: provider.publicKey,
      toPubkey: accountId,
      lamports: LAMPORTS_PER_SOL/10 // (0.1 SOL)
    })
  )
 ```
then in ts I do `const contractState = await program.account.escrowAccount.fetch(escrowAccount.publicKey)`

but I cant find a way to do an `assert.ok(...` on the result of fetch
like I have state:

```
#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum ContractStates {
    Inactive,
    Active,
    Closed,
}

#[account]
pub struct EscrowAccount {
    pub vault_account: Pubkey,
    pub eligible_token: Pubkey,
    pub contract_state: ContractStates,
}
```
does anyone know how to nicely verify an enum returned from a contract in ts/js?
I think you can just take a look at some new token instructions.
they don't need to pass rent system var anymore 
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L37
for NFT, update authority will be store in token metadata account.
you can take a look here https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/advanced/metaplex/get-tokenmeta.html
thanks. I used CLI. was fine.
how do i calculate if a account is rent except without passing in a program
I see, ok thanks. Yes CLI worked. thanks
So i was told after 1.6.5 we dont need a sysvar account if so how do i calculate if a account is rent_exempt as it requires a rentstruct as the first parameter ?
seems like a kindly protection. 
normal user will use on-curve pubkey (ed25519 )
PDA fall off curve.
try sollet.io
phantom banned me?  why would that happen?
seems phantom ban you to send to a PDA.
you can use your cli tool or some sdk to compose transfer instruction.
oh okay
nah, im trying to see if an account exists on-chain (has it been created)
why is it that I can do solana balance on this address but I can't send SOL to it?
not sure if i got the question, but if you want to check if its a user's account or some program account you can just check the owner of the account. The owner is System program for user accounts.
you mean `.lamports()`? Yes, it's a system program account. I guess that would be better because today i learned you can create an account without initializing data
if it is a system program's account, data will be zero. I think you can check its balance equals 0.
somehow on devnet Phantom was saying unable to send, despite my wallet having more than enough SOLs. I want to send just to test reading the Program's SOL balance. My eventual goal is to create a custom instruction that requires the user to also pay some SOL.
you can't use curl to fetch it but you can just write json data to some account and your program fetch the account.
yes. every account in solana can receive SOL but why you want to send your SOL to a program address?
is it possible to send SOL to a program address?
is it possible to a fetch a json from its uri in a solana program?
in my program code, if I'm trying to see if an account on the blockchain is initialized, and I have an `AccountInfo` object, is `data_is_empty()` sufficient for checking this?
Is there a getTokenAccountsByOwner method on-chain?
thanks Jack. i've used this method before to get the mint address -- but sadly it does't have the update authority
hey guys.  trying to find a way to run an IDO on Solana.  Anyone can point me in the right direction for this please?  thanks
outputs mintAuthority
yep
```{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getAccountInfo",
    "params": [
        "4NnLbYJ65nEZ6grKeY8n2brFGxr1uBjSBqbf6Ym3peFZ",
        {
            "encoding": "jsonParsed"
        }
    ]
}```
I think that'll be inside the account data, let me check
have you found a way to get an update authority for a given token/NFT address using RPC calls?
though it takes a few seconds to run, I'm a just save the input as it won't be used for too long
https://github.com/samuelvanderwaal/metaboss has a good function to "Snapshot all mint accounts for a given candy machine id or update authority"
i haven't seen a good solution to get them all
<@!196686304354893824> same SSL certification issue
let me see thanks
need them all
yep, you can use `getTokenLargestAccounts`
https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account#finding-the-associated-token-account-address
```cargo test```
Run a unit test.
can someone please help me through this? I'm trying to install anchor for rust, for solana dev
(I'm a beginner)
Can‚Äôt find it in solana-program crate https://docs.rs/solana-program/latest/solana_program/all.html
can this be called by a program?
Ah found it in the RPC api. getTokenSupply
Try `Instruction::new_with_borsh(...)`
How can I find token supply programmatically?
If you have good experience, let's make it together.
I wanna collaborate with skilled contract developer(rust) for building it
Hello, dear everyone, I wanna build the marketplace on solana
anyone know what RPC call is being used to load list of token accounts associated to a mint?
Hi,
I am trying to modify the existing transfer_lamport program from solana-program-library in github.
I need to send amount  of type u128 to process_instruction method.
Here is what I tried so far,

Inside both test and processor, I made the following struct,
```rust
#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Debug)]
pub struct LamportAmount {
    /// amount of lamports
    pub amount: u128,
}
```


And this is how I serialize it inside the test program, and send it as instruction_data.
```rust
let lamport_amount = LamportAmount { amount: 5 };
let serialized_lamport_amount = lamport_amount.try_to_vec().unwrap();    // Serialize LamportAmount
let mut transaction = Transaction::new_with_payer(
    &[Instruction::new_with_bincode(
        program_id,
        &serialized_lamport_amount,
        vec![
            AccountMeta::new(source_pubkey, false),
            AccountMeta::new(destination_pubkey, false),
        ]
    )],
    Some(&payer.pubkey()),
);
```

But inside process_instruction(), when I try to deserialize instruction_data, I get Err() instead of OK().
This is how I deserialize it process_instruction(),
```rust
let amount: u128 = {
                    match LamportAmount::try_from_slice(instruction_data)
                    {
                        Ok(amount_struct) => amount_struct.amount,
                        Err(_) => 0
                    }
                };
```
'amount' always gets 0.

Please help. What am I doing wrong?

I have some questions about the callstack.

I have a proxy program that can be called by any user. It takes as parameter a target program that must be called.
This target program is configured to only accept calls by the proxy program.
In order to do this, the proxy program is calling the target program with `invoke_signed` and the target program verify that the callee is the proxy program by checking if it is a signer.
However, there is a flaw in this system. The user could pass as parameter a program he controls. The proxy will call the user controlled program which will then call the target program.
The target program will then think that the callee is the proxy program (because the proxy program will be a signer) but I want the target program to only be callable by direct calls from the proxy program.
This would require me to have access to the callstack to check who is the direct callee.

Is there a way to verify who is the direct callee ?

is anyone aware of an off-the-shelf staking program? Ie one that would let me pay anyone who deposits their tokens into a vault some % yield, coming from an account I provide

If you use `solana program deploy` you can update ... yes.
On testnet, I had already deployed a program (rust). I then edited the program, rebuilt, and deployed it again. It output-ed the same program ID. Does this mean Programs are editable/updatable in Solana?
Anyone knows if there is an open source solution to staking your own coin on solana ?

how in GODS NAME DO YOU SIGN A ANCHOR generated TRANSACTION with a WALLET
yeah i'm pretty sure.
so when it calls redeemBond, it takes the user address and gets the data account with user address as a parameter
shiet - i'm just reading old chats: does it mean the createBond program itself creates accounts with the user address as a seed of sorts?
instead of a key-value data stucture
every key would be an account
i'm trying to understand how programs like vesting and bonding works in terms of where it stores the data in solana: let's say we have a program called createBond that takes your token (transfer it to another account), writes some data about when to return it back to you, where do we actually store this data? is it in another account itself that stores all the data about which addresses invoked the createBond program and at what time? (somewhat like a humongous key-value storage on an address LOL) or more practically, is it on some user owned account so that when the user called redeemBond, it checks that user specific storage address/account for date/amount values?

?
like from the solana explorer
in common we use ATA to make connection between SOL address (owner), mint and token account.
https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account
So `createAccountWithSeed` takes your wallet's keypair and derives an account from it?
I think there are many ways to do it.
you can take a look at
1. https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/PublicKey.html#findProgramAddress
2. https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/SystemProgram.html#createAccountWithSeed
if you want to parse tx data, you need to know how program deserialize it.
for example if you get [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
it can be  one u64 or two u32 or eight u8
there are too many possible. I don't think you can just guess it without any context.
okay
in rust
I guess my question is how do you associate (auth and stuff) a account with your wallet's pubkey
not sure I understand your qn. when you use `Keypair.generate();` you will get pubkey and private key. if tx singed by private key, chain believe you own this pubkey so you can transfer or do something else.
Like `Keypair.generate();` creates a new keypair but how are you supposed to store that with some users wallet?
I'm confused about the need to create a account keypair to store data and how like a wallet's keypair gets associated with that account
So, I have this token mint address, how do i check the token account ??
might ask paul himself
hello, how can i get my keypair from phantom wallet to be used with solana cli?

double check your code that you haven't missed anything. A coma, a bracket. Check the url in your json file
Keep trying
I cant remember how I solved it tho. I think its just a problem with the solana connectivity.
Hi, did you find a solution to this?  I'm receiving this error on mainnet today.
That wouldn't add up as we're only increasing one account's balance right?
I was following a tutorial by Paulx, and I came across this piece of code,
```
**initializers_main_account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? = initializers_main_account
            .lamports()
            .checked_add(escrow_account.lamports())
            .ok_or(EscrowError::AmountOverflow)?;

        **escrow_account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? = 0;
        *escrow_account.try_borrow_mut_data()? = &mut [];
```

and I was wondering what would happen if I didn't zero the `escrow_account`??
if I'm trying to see if an account on the blockchain is initialized, and I have an `AccountInfo` object, is `data_is_empty()` sufficient for checking this?
Haha all good Kartar - I'm glad you got it working!

generally less than initial deploy, based on number of transactions. I would test on dev and testnet for the best estimate currently. not sure there is a deploy estimator as of yet.

you could get all tokens for the owner and then check the mints.

hey everyone what is the fee of re-deploying program ?
google that sentence
hey guys! I'm Java developer, but smart contracts and blockchain technologies are new things to me. Where can I get started?
like checking if they had an nft in their wallet
is there any examples of checking if a user has a specific token in a solana program?
ahh sure. I will do that thank you
images, especially like that are not very friendly. in general try to copy and paste small portions, or link to relevant errors and or code.
im passing the token address and instantiating  it inside new publicKey object and then converting it to base58 and its still giving me this error.
hi,
what does this error means...
Thank you
primarily vs code, can handle it all.
everything, from rust to react sure
are you doing only rust coding or web development?
vs code
what ide are you guys using?
but i think on solana you'd need a little extra workaround, still doable tho, just not so clean
also because ethereum contracts have constructors, you can call code automatically as the contract is deployed, therefore having an airtight deployment where there's no room for having to set authorities after the deployment. You can set the authority as a parameter of the deployment itself
something simple like this
you have an owner, you can transfer ownership, and you get a modifier to put on any function that you only want the owner to call
hmm, gotcha. If you have done any Ethereum development, the OpenZeppelin team created some pre-written code that is very simple for what im trying to achieve here on Solana
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol
if you find or come up with anything would love to see it.
haha I at times do the same. im not sure anyone has exactly what you have in mind. it may depends on more details. but aside from some authority or few other variables I have not seen much in the way of controls that is remotely modular. the spl_governance program is impressive and extensive, but thats different.
yeah technically ik how to do it i was just looking for some simple examples that maybe already do it. Everytime i write code i feel like someone it doing it cleaner, so, i try to look elsewhere first ig
i mean, through admin controls, and functions, like pausing, there is essentially the implementation of controlling program function based on variables and controls. the exact implementation may not fit what you have in mind, but if you apply the concept of using stored variables, combined with authority, you can pretty much do whatever you want?
from what i understand this looks like it has access control over just PDAs, not over a program itself, unless i am wrong?
Does a solana program NEED to interact with the state of the chain to be valid? Or could you just put a program on there that uses up programming resouces without actually paying anything and call it over and over to exhaust the computational power of the network? What am I missing here?
thanks!

pass lke random array to the new from array ?
Hello, I am looking at `createAccountWithSeed` and it says that the seed is a string. But, when deriving an account, it uses an array of buffers. I was wondering how to go from one to another?
hi so I have this token under a account, when I write a solana program for it 
```rust
pub const SYSTEM_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS: Pubkey = Pubkey::new_from_array()
```
what do I add here ?
yea, sounds right..  base key, seeds, etc, used to create the account.
we are trying to implement an ido pool. i am a member in that group and no one answered our question. lol thank you for the reply
check out quarry protocol:
https://github.com/QuarryProtocol/quarry
you may want to try the radium discord:
https://discord.com/invite/6EvFwvCfpx
or github: 
https://github.com/raydium-io
whoever asked about Solana programs, they are executed on chain by the Solana runtime where the instructions are passed into the programs - when programs are deployed they are on chain. you communicate with programs using clients (web3, cli, json rpc, an sdk etc)
windows, powershell, and anchor? this is interesting. 
That might mean its expecting an expression, maybe a result, and nothing is there or being returned. looks like you need to sharpen up on some rust overall.  but its also easy to copy and follow examples provided.  also the anchor discord if here : https://discord.gg/bZq8hDuB
where anchor is used or referenced:  especially when your learning, I would have open and closely reference docs and samples that you can run. learn by doing, observing, and reviewing. trial err.
this is exactly what i needed, thank you!
hi everyone we are trying to deploy our ido pool and we run into this. sorry we are still learning solana.
Is there a program that anyone knows about that implements an admin/ownership system doing things like setting some program-wide variables, contract pausing, etc?
Does anyone here has any experience with Raydium pools on Solana?
for a btree, you can reference the mighty <@!814228493302497301> examples. and search the discord history for his many related well put answers and recommendations.  key, value.
if you havent seen this, it was some current progress or implementation, and I did not look at any updates or pull requests, that might exist for it.
https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/tree/master/packages/core/angular
there should be a way to use it, fix it, or figure it out if you willing, as are all community contributions.
wallets sign transactions. this example you found, would be in the case where maybe a web3 client or service has the actual keypair, under whatever circumstance. for wallets instead, to sign transactions, you would need to use the wallet signing methods available to your wallet implementation, and add the appropriate instructions inside the transactions your signing and sending, ala standard wallet practice, something like: 
const transactionId = await wallet.signTransaction(transaction);
alternatively, you may be able to use a method similar to above, and assign your wallet as the mintAuthority, and whatever other keypair you make or have access to, that has funds, can be a payer. that may also work based on methods and what u have available..
how can i store data (like a BTreeMap) on an account?
i am angular dev my self, but i gave up opensouce blockchain-related project in angular since no one maintain such modules/plugins....
everyone using react.
i know, its a bummer... and even if you do find a good plugin that support angular, it wont hold for long...
does anyone have a working example of angular + wallet adapter ?
+ github was down
I keep coming back to this and I just can't get it...

```
export async function createMint(
    connection: Connection,
    payer: Signer,
    mintAuthority: PublicKey,
    freezeAuthority: PublicKey | null,
    decimals: number,
    keypair?: Keypair,
    confirmOptions?: ConfirmOptions,
    programId = TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
): Promise<PublicKey> {
    keypair ||= Keypair.generate();
```

How am I supposed to pass the "payer: Signer"?
The only way I got it working was to to literally hardcode my wallets private key in a constant like this:

```
const payer = Keypair.fromSecretKey(bs58.decode('secret key'))

...

splToken.Token.createMint(
  connection,
  payer
  ...
)
```

Please throw some light at me, i've been stuck for hours on this
if you ever run into this issue, and you've tried increasing your maximum opened files, you are likely running into a genesis state that's too large https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/21452
what are the maximum api called i can make to solana web3 until it crash? (üòÜ )
does it require a owned type and not a borrowed type ?
"  invoke_signed(
            &system_instruction::create_account(
                payer.key,
                new_pda_account.key,
                rent.minimum_balance(space).max(1),
                space as u64,
                owner,
            ),
            &[
                payer.clone(),
                new_pda_account.clone(),
                system_program.clone(),
            ],
            &[new_pda_signer_seeds],
        )
    }
}"

Why do we have to call .clone on a borrowed refrence ?
was jw if there's a direct method
yeah thanks! i've taken a look at these before, it seems you basically have to loop and update the `before` field until you reach the end
if you see there are some options here: some different methods may have different options as well before? until? etc: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#SignaturesForAddressOptions
other services may have additional options as well, Solana.fm, pyth, and different ways to query are coming. for transactions history that is much older that would be a different approach.
is there not a way to fetch transactions for an address in ascending order? `getSignatures` for address returns them in desc order
sounds like u want the mint for the token, tho. in which case, you can get the account info for the token, and see the mint address associated with the token. if thats the case: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getParsedAccountInfo.
generally, you have a token mint, and a wallet, and create associated addresses based on a mint, for a wallet (or address), with which you associate a 'token address' with that token mint address, for the wallet (address).
hmm, this function takes in the tokenMintAddress tho - this is what I'm trying to get
https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account
here are a collection of NFT and Metadata resources. someone of which contain repos of sites that have components to mint, and much more, including how to build a store front.

Where is the best help or place to create a minting site... If its dapp scaffold how would I create the website just css?
Thank you My dear Lisenmayben may great things come to you and your family ser
is there a reason the genesis size is limited to 10MB ?
given a token account address, is there a way to get the associated mint (spl-token) address?
Hey, quick question... What is the second damn parameter that I have to pass to `splToken.Token.createMint` method from `@solana/spl-token`

Github examples use a random generated `Keypair` from where they can extract the `publicKey` and `privateKey`. However I would like to pass the Keypair of my current wallet address, but I'm just able to get the `publicKey` from the `useWallet()` hook from `wallet-adapter`.
is this an accountsDB issue? or is the byte maximum keeping the service from scanning sufficiently?
getProgramAccounts doesn't seem to be returning any results for a given mint when clearly the mint is present
It appears that I need an additional ~10 SOL in my wallet when I do the second deployment, but the second deploy only actually ends up costing me a ~0.01 SOL?
If I deploy a program to mainnet (paying ~10 SOL) and I then want to re-deploy 60 mins later with a few changes, do I have to pay ~10 SOL again or can a recover the funds from the first deployment?

would you have any recommended resource to read up on cranks? googling leads me to https://github.com/Bonfida/token-vesting which is pretty useful
thanks! i was assuming that _everything_ would be decentralized in the spirit of blockchain lol
always brother
overwrite worked fine, you're a lifesaver. hope you're doing well fren
whats up rohan.  u should just be able to run the install for the version, if needed remove the current install from the folder  install/release or whatever your path.  and overwrite may work.
it depends on their setup, but possibly something similar. with cloud or distributed services and servers or server-less you can mitigate or remove the concept of a server failing, in the traditional sense. there is a concept of cranks. and many eth and evm use this concept too.
is there a way to downgrade my cli version? on `1.9.0` trying to get to `1.8.5`
there should be in the near future
Is there a typescript equivalent for https://docs.rs/spl-associated-token-account/1.0.3/spl_associated_token_account/fn.create_associated_token_account.html?
Can I run this with 0 validators?
Ah good to see you guys removed all the fees from the stake pool. Always felt scammy https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/stake-pool/cli/scripts/setup-stake-pool.sh
hi all! web developer here trying to understand more about blockchain - i'm looking at ohm projects and they have this concept of "rebasing every X seconds". Based on my current knowledge, programs/contracts need to be invoked, so the idea of a timer-based function doesn't exist (unless i'm mistaken, or unless the program calls itself after some kind of sleep function?). Does that mean they literally have a server calling the function kind of like a cron and the entire rebasing mechanism fails if the server fails?
whats wrong with this code? it returns Error: 404 Not Found
```js
await connection.getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner(
        new anchor.web3.PublicKey('av6Audt1fhGyXAZMoTPTrVfMAXfRBymhgbP5EpMAzCg'),
        { programId: new anchor.web3.PublicKey('TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA') }

Hey 
Can anyone explain how accounts are created ? SystemProgram::CreateAccountWithSeed, Pubkey::CreateProgramAddress came across these 2 functions so why  are there 2 functions in the first place ? and how do create a pda account on chain any code example you could provide, as per the docs the function is PUBKEY:::create_program_address if so what is the difference between this and systemprogram ?

Is there a way to calculate how much SOL is needed to deploy a specific program?
https://discordapp.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/905788773219053588 I have an answer to my own question:

My deploy failed because I didn't have enough SOL, I underestimated how much SOL I needed to deploy my program (3.15 SOL). Since the deploy command had decreased my balance and put it in the intermediate buffer I thought I had enough, but it just took some of the amount and later needed the rest to complete. 

I think the error message needs to be improved upon
That's correct, account resizing is a feature we want to add but isn't not available yet
So to "resize" an account I need to "change" it's pubkey. Or in another words, I have to create a new account, copy the contents, and close the older.
You could do something like this https://spl.solana.com/token#finding-all-token-accounts-for-a-specific-mint
I would, as in this context I would be the original creator.
You can't resize the account within the same transaction currently, that's the main limitation I can think of here
Do you have the Mint of the NFT?
I've been looking through the docs, but can't find how I could find the pubkey of a specific NFT holder? (Programmatically)
Is it possible to close an account with pubkey X and create another with the same pubkey X in the same transaction?
I hope it's fine like this now üôÇ
and even tried singlegossip
well i am running confirmed
explorer may be using a higher level of commitment than optimistically confirmed
Seems to be running fine according to explorer
i am using custom quicknode $99 rpc node.
is mainnet clogged atm? takes 15s for transaction to appear on explorer after sending it via web3js.
Thanks
Yes
thank you
data length is the account size right?
in devnet
You can run `solana program show <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>`
how can i get the program size? i know about getting the size for a struct but have no idea about this
I believe rent is the same on both. You can call `getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption` with the program account size.
kind of a stupid question i guess but deployin on mainnet and devnet do they cost the same for a particular contract or is it different for both?
It looks like the folder is actually the mint address of the token
Do I just create a folder under the asset directory and upload my logo , or it‚Äôs done automatically
hi , I am adding my token list to the solana token list on github. I see that the logo asset for each token is in a hash generated folder . How do I do that for my token
Cool thank u
I believe there is an update, but it still uploads to my knowledge. Please check with metaplex https://discord.gg/metaplex
Hey guys. A noob question but is there any way to edit the attributes of a NFT (json files) without re-uploading it to the mainnet?
Good stuff. üëç
"solana-keygen recover prompt://?key=0/0", entering the mnemonic and leaving the passphrase blank did the trick.
Thank you!
is there a way to have #[derive(Accounts)] optional to avoid  code: 167,
  msg: 'The given account is not owned by the executing program' error ?
Read the CLI docs about hierarchical derived addresses... You probably need to pass in prompt://?key=0/0
is it possible?
its like: I have a token and I'd like to authorize another account to spend my token
could you tell me if its possible (and how to) set spend authorization to an account?
hey y'all
How can I turn the sollet.io mnemonic into a private key that can be used with the Solana Cli?
I tried the "solana-keygen recover" but it brings a different (and empty) wallet.

Or how can I extract the private key from sollet?
for tx fee you can take a look at https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/transaction-fees#fee-parameters
every solana's tx need to wrap a recent blockhash. when you retrieve a recent blockhash. it will also return you a fee calculator. you can use it to calculate tx fee.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getrecentblockhash

the lamports to create a token account we called it `rent`
you can take a look at https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/rent
and https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getminimumbalanceforrentexemption
I think thats the FEE

isnt that just transaction cost? I thought accounts cost more
ya
So 0.000005 SOL to open ATA account?
so 5000 lamports
it is per signature
is there a good chart of the current fees on Solana, for example looking for the price of ATA account creation
Hi, does anyone understand why a token that used to look like an NFT & has NFT metadata attached - no longer shows up as an NFT in either Solana Explorer or SolScan? It was fine to start with & now the image, creators array etc. has all disappeared... link below in case anyone can take a quick look & advise:

<https://solscan.io/token/Cozug9qMCujPwPmpCoxQi8rUppRh2hQXSCe7YLKPc8yt#holders>
since its 6 decimals
got it so so serum would be 1 * 10^6
token transfer's amount depends on the token's decimals
if decimals is 3 and you want to transfer 1 token, your amount is 1000
and the "amount" is in lamports right
yup.
Got it, so it's the actual "token account" owed by the wallet.
in token transfer. you will use
1. from (token account)
2. to (token account)
3. auth (from's owner)
if you use a non-token account in the to, you will get an error when you send the tx
<@!788215642070581289> so the "to account" can I use the wallet pubkey or do I have to grab the ATA account for the specific token?
I like that, I will try that thx
to me, I will check the account's ATA first. (a kind of token account).
if exist I just send token to it. if not exist I will add some extra instructions for creating a token account for it then I transfer to it.
Does createTransferInstruction send to empty accounts? say for example the wallet does not have the given SPL token is there an option to fund that account or would I have to do a separate check for that
https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/rent#timings-of-collecting-rent
is there a formula to calculate rent cost per epoch per space per day?
I think you will need to use sdk to fetch the imgURL
https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/advanced/metaplex/get-tokenmeta/main.ts

oh wait yes lol thx

Hi guys, any idea on how to customise the WalletMultiButton from ‚Äòwallet-adapter‚Äô? Stuck with the inability to remove the ‚Äòwallet-adapter-button‚Äô class

Some context on the Button

https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/blob/c64705db3523bd3e3da79bd06355b23e30add8de/packages/ui/react-ui/src/Button.tsx#L13
I remember phantom can add custom token on it. maybe try to add your mint by yourself
There are a few repositories about airdropping multiple nfts. Let me see if I can find you one.
oh. maybe you can send a request to phantom team haha. make them to do this feature.
thanks!
I'm on the mainnet. I also can transfer the token from one address to other and actually can see those changes on the Solana explorer. The thing is on the phanton wallet that not show the token there in any of the wallets.
but cant be done via phantom wallet or any other wallet, you have to program code ok
actually a nft transfer is just a instruction.
so basically you can transfer not only one NFT in one tx because you can pack many instructions in the same tx
üôÇ
Thanks for that - just that the need is a little urgent and a mentor could answer questions and guide faster
<#763249718339567626> is free üòâ
the idea is the same. you use a token account to transfer to another token account.
you can take a look at https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/token-transfer/main.en.ts
Hey guys, need a Solana mentor - willing to pay by the hour - pls send me a friend request if interested
maybe check your connection. there are at least three different networks in solana.
any good examples of doing an spl-token transfer with the solana-py libary?
Check in the documentation of Metaplex https://docs.metaplex.com/development/clients/js-sdk/getting-started
i'm not aware of an api for it
or do i have to click each nft to transfer to another account?
is there a way to send nfts in batch in one transaction?
Hello, is anyone here in Lisbon, Portugal!  I am looking to chat with other devs about a project I want to build on Solana üôÇ
any idea if there is a api to call?
the solana api won't be able to return it since it's third party data. in this case it's the metaplex standard of saving metadata: <https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard>
This could have with that my Token account is not rent-exempt? Sorry. Im pretty new
Hi Guys, does anyone know how to get the imgURL from a minted NFT. Like this for example?

someone sent sol to the contract address, how to return it? can anybody help this?
using solana cli version 1.8.2
Yes, I am able to recover the intermediate account's balance afterwards on dev/test so connection should be working fine
And `solana config get` is setup with the target (devnet or testnet) and key?
how anchor workspace work, when i run example test,  below error happen,maybe somewhere i need to replace my program id, any idea help me ,thanks.

```
const program = anchor.workspace.Basic0; #here where it to find the program id .
```
```
Transaction simulation failed: Attempt to load a program that does not exist
```
misread, sorry
Ahhh
the `--reset` flag starts a clean ledger loading your default KEYPAIR (see `solana config get`)
I assume that will deploy the program locally? I am already able to do that, but can't deploy to devnet or testnet
You can start the `solana-test-validator` with the program and it will load it:
```bash
solana-test-validator --bpf-program <PROGRAM_ID> target/deploy/<NAME>.so --ledger .ledger --reset
```
For example, in my case:
```bash
solana-test-validator --bpf-program SampGgdt3wioaoMZhC6LTSbg4pnuvQnSfJpDYeuXQBv target/deploy/solana_beetle.so --ledger .ledger --reset
```
I am unable to deploy solana programs to devnet and testnet, but I am able to deploy to localhost solana-test-validator. I have tried both my own program and the official helloworld rust program. I run

```
cargo build-bpf
solana program deploy <.sofile>
```

and just get output

```
================================================================================
Recover the intermediate account's ephemeral keypair file with
`solana-keygen recover` and the following 12-word seed phrase:
================================================================================

================================================================================
To resume a deploy, pass the recovered keypair as the
[BUFFER_SIGNER] to `solana program deploy` or `solana write-buffer'.
Or to recover the account's lamports, pass it as the
[BUFFER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS] argument to `solana program close`.
================================================================================

hey guys, is there a way to derive a public key from another public key or do I also need the private key. I know Solana uses ed25519 & so only hardened derivation, therefore it shouldn't be possible. would still be cool if someone knows of a solution for this?
When using next js frontend how can I make sure the wallet stays connected when switching pages
ah, sorry maybe im wording it wrong! for example, would there be a way for me to make use of the highlighted code snippet without installing superstruct packages, etc?
there is a C# and NET SDK community, that primarily looks to integrate these things.  SOLNET.
looks like there is a unity sample wallet in the source code. probably can just load it into a project and see how it works. There is no official support for this. Just a group that is waiting for the Unity upgrade to hopefully really build some things out.
oh by extract you meant import üôÇ   
you can look at the web3.js package and import anything you want from there..
i dont see any docs
yeah but how to actually use it?
Hello friends. I have a question. Is there anyone who is a blockchain developer and works on blockchain games?
this is the only related unity integration that I know of, I know more support is anticipated after the Unity .NET framework upgrade. from what I heard.
https://github.com/allartprotocol/unity-solana-wallet
yes, i can install the same packages as source code, was just wondering if the library allows us to import them directly as well for ease of use üôÇ
Fixed: add `rent_sysvar` account while invoke other program in `account_infos` params
the source code is available. in the githubs.
Alright thanks!
there is not very good support for native windows atm, as far as I know, and validators do not appear to be working well or at all on windows either.  you can easily use WSL though.
is there any way to extract the parsers from `@solana/web3.js` libraries? for example, `create()` or `jsonRpcResultAndContext()` from `connection`?
Thanks for replying
Alright
If you use Linux, it is better than Windows
Is this an issue because of windows?
Metaplex is the NFT standard, and for adding meta data:
https://docs.metaplex.com/
use WSL - and or download the UBUNTU distro from the windows store for free.
Any ideas?
And then after having ran the second and closing the cmd they said that solana --version doesn't work
**How to add a URI in NFT token in Solana?**

I've gone through many Solana minting tutorials but haven't found one that shows how to include a URI into NFT token like in Ethereum ERC 721 or 1155.
After running the first command to install it this shows up
I am trying to help someone install solana cli on windows

And i also pass the sysvar  account in the instruction.
Hi, i create account in my program dependent solana version `1.8.2`  on local cluster(`1.8.2`) got error `Instruction references an unknown account SysvarRent111111111111111111111111111111111`.
Does anyone know why?
hmmm
yes, encoding is only available via `_rpcRequest` unfortunately
I remember web3's get multiple account method can't pass `jsonParsed` encode.
maybe you will need to parse account data by yourself or you can just send a PR to it.
or try to call the raw rpc method
seems like this is how the library does it :
```    
const res = create(
   unsafeRes,
   jsonRpcResultAndContext(nullable(ParsedAccountInfoResult)),
);
```
actually, what if i wanted to do `connection.getParsedAccountInfo()` instead? would it be wise to just parse the data client-side to have less API calls total? how exactly do i go about doing that?
cool. you can use this https://docs.rs/solana-client/1.8.2/solana_client/
and use something like 
```rust
let rpc_client = RpcClient::new("http://api.devnet.solana.com".to_string());
```
the url can be changed to the node you want.
Nope, the url of the cluster, for a CLI. I wanna know if the caller has configured solana for a local/test/prod node.
what do you mean about cluster configuration? are you talking about validator config?
oh ok so i was correct then, thank u üòÑ
you can take a look at https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getmultipleaccounts
I think it is exactly a multiple accounts version getAccountIfo.
i just reset the mac and installed everything using simple curl commands and it's now working although solana-test-validator doesn't work it's missing the openssl i think brew install ssl would do the trick here...
Is there a way to get the current cluster configuration in the Rust code? https://docs.rs/solana/0.17.2/solana
I don't see any docs for connecting wallet with  unity. Can someone link some docs that works with unity C#
How can I get exactly this in unity?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=32&v=Ef0ZqpzhD7M&feature=youtu.be
want to double check, if i want to call `connection.getAccountInfo()` for multiple accounts, will `'getMultipleAccounts'` RPC call be there correct way to do it isntead?
feels bad üò≠ I had a problem where the new m1 updated my keyboard firmware and bonked my keyboard working on my main computer so now i have to update the firmware every time i change computers lol
i installed the solana envrionment on my other MAC BIG SUR OS and it worked like a charm.....
oh there are two dependencies you need to dl for it to work if ur not on m1. Brew install openssl@1.1 and brew install coreutils
i'm using the macOS Cataline.. i'll check
https://twitter.com/TomGeshury/status/1446728548555841537 you should complain to Joao as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3Ipaju-ec you dont need to use rosetta with latest solana, but if you want to use anchor you need rosetta still
you need to build from source for m1
hello i'm trying to set up solana dev env on my mac. everything is installed but when I do cargo builld-bpf it says rustup toolchain error not a file.... i checked and i now what file i'm missing but where can i download it's toolchain as i did encounter this error and rectified it by downloading the package from solana github repo it had dependencies for rust. but now i downloaded it and it didn't have complete things. everytime i install it has some things missing and i dont know why? any help would be much appreciated.
hey! just joined here and was looking for a developer for an nft project. Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask just looking for some guidance!!!
Thank you, yes, I already checked the code for explorer using the mint parameter for `getSignaturesForAddress` is probably the way I'll go for fetching current information.
You can see a list of transactions for an address on explorer, so there should be an RPC for it (i.e. the same one explorer uses).
I asked about this a while back, maybe someone has any idea if this is the way?

gm everyone, I'm trying to find the proper way to figure out if a buy or sale has happened on an NFT using the JSON RPC endpoints. Should I be using `getSignaturesForAddress` and go through all the transactions using `getTransaction` to find out if my wallet was in there? Or should I try and use `getTokenLargestAccounts`  and get the related transaction(s) for this token account? I would like to see what I and some friends bought and sold over time. Any hint or tutorial or anything greatly appreciated.
So far signMessage only worked for Sollet and Phantom and both not with the hardware ledger attached, at least for me
This helped me a lot https://gist.github.com/creativedrewy/9bce794ff278aae23b64e6dc8f10e906#step-2-locate-nft-accounts
ok, I will find out how. thanks
you can also use sdk to compose message and signatures I think.
is there any other way to sign a transaction offline for a multisig  account without using the Cli?
for me, watch source code and try to write some code to interact with it is the best practice.
thanks
I want to realize a basic nft mint/sell in production, is it a best practice to use offical token and token-metadata program, just use web3 client to recall the offical program is enough for me? Much tks.
if you are using multisig account which is defined in token program
here is the data len https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/state.rs#L214
and you can use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getminimumbalanceforrentexemption or cli command `solana rent xxx` to get the amount
I  created a multisig account and made it the mint authority for my spl token . How do I know the amount of sol to add to make it rent exempt. or is it that I don't need to add any sol to the multisig account?
but it's not a byte slice, its some weird enum
account's data is what you want. BTW I have just used rust sdk to query and found that it has already parsed for us. correct me if you got a different result.



yeah, where can i get the account data? im digging through the returned structs and none of them appear to provide the actual raw account data lol
here is the key.
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/state.rs#L127-L128
this is a layout of token account.
you can just parse the account info to get the balance.
for a token account, it has 165 bytes
depend on the doc, the balance is stored in data[64:64+8] 
use little endian and u64 to parse it.
does anyone know how to get the balance of a token account from the returned values from `get_token_accounts_by_owner` in the rust rpc_client crate without making an extra call
Oh lol, I think I just found it: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token
Hey, is there any openzeppelin equivalents for Solana tokens and NFTs?
Hi, what's the best way to retrieve NFT in a wallet from JS ? (method to use is enough :p ) thanks
EDIT: NVM, seems getTokenAccountsByOwner() is what i'm lookign for
Ty
Oh ok that makes sense, will do!
You'll need to ask them about what they did there.
They probably created their own fake USDC mint on devnet
Wonder how that works
Thats odd, I can see usdc is supported on Mango devnet
Nowhere, Circle only supports testnet.  I'll ping them again about this actually.  No promises it'll help though
where can i get some usdc on devnet?
alright, thx
We'll get on it
I see you already filed one
There's definitely a bug with the sollet connect function in the adapter. What it is though, I am not sure.
I'll check into it. For now, definitely file an issue https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/issues
I'm not doing anything smart, but the `useWallet` hook should give me access to the publicKey of the wallet and it doesn't
I don't think it is
So it looks like the button may have an error. Although it says `connecting...`, the wallet is in fact connected
If your local works, can you tell me what version?
And check the difference
Let me double check local
Interesting, I cannot
Can you connect with sollet here https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/example/ ?
I'm trying to understand why sollet doesn't work with it
I think we already spoke in a different discord Jacob üòÑ
Yes, I have used it before
ANyone here using wallet-adapter? https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/905506934688464906
I think Trent mentioned using `--no-bpf-jit` and it solved someone else's issue on deployment
We need to get more core devs on M1 hardware to smooth this out.  (and now that the 16" M1 MBP is out, I can to get one finally too!)
And in general, I found 3 or 4 different guides for setting up Solana on M1, is there official documentation anywhere? It really discourages adoption
Hey folks if I compile Solana from sources (I'm on Apple M1) do I need to use x86 Rust or am I cool with ARM rust toolchain. I managed to compile everything with ARM but my test validator acts weird, it doesn't confirm some transactions. Basically the behaviour similar to https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/18033
Try https://discord.gg/metaplex
When creating  candy machine with metaplex, many blog posts use the "--price" option to set a "mint price" - what is this exactly? It's the price that would be paid to mint tokens on the candy machine? I would assume this should be zero when you are minting your own NFTs to sell later?
During the solana api request with XXXXXX.com as origin we get 403 Forbidden:

curl -I -XOPTIONS  https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/ -H 'origin: XXXXX.com' -H 'access-control-request-method: GET'

Using the same request via subdomain *.XXXXXX.com we get the same error

curl -I -XOPTIONS  https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/ -H 'origin: https://12345.xxxxxxxxxxxx.com/' -H 'access-control-request-method: GET'

using any other domain (even the one that doesn't exist) we get 200 OK:

curl -I -XOPTIONS  https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/ -H 'origin: https://xyz12345abc.com/' -H 'access-control-request-method: GET'

Why do the requests from XXXX.com as an origin might be blocked?
It may seem a bit strange, but that's because it's a type-safe language, so you need a way to be very clear about what combinations of data an `Instruction` can hold.
hell of a way to go about it =/
basically my doorway to being able to have my one program do different things lol
That would be a language implementation detail, but basically yeah - it's rust's way of doing a discriminated union (aka tagged union: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union)
well, im assuming that it takes the first byte and uses that as the enum value to determine which instruction and then the following bytes after that are the data that get deserialized into those arguments as defined in the enum
That is a helper function to create an `Instruction` for you. That was probably used to create the instruction in the first place... the `match` is just fancy syntax to de-reference the appropriate struct members out of the instruction object.. the instruction is already there in the `input` in that case. I think the thing confusing you is not understanding rust enums and how they are being leveraged to create type safe instructions with associated values bound inside the match blocks.
its gotta be a step in the order prior to this point that i dont understand yet
trying to find where its called from
I see this:
```/// Creates an CreateMetadataAccounts instruction

Thanks!! I will check it.
Stake pool doesn't is something else
Step created something for this https://github.com/step-finance/reward-pool
it's in the `instruction` item already
prior to the casting
but where does the data actually get populated into it?
args in that instance is a generic type that gets cast into whatever the enum defines
its like generics casting
i get what you're saying
it's not prior to that point... that is the point at which is it assigned.
i dont see how args.data ever gets populated prior to that point
is it being instantiated by MetadataInstruction::CreateMetadataAccount(args)?
it's not a function call - it's matching one of the values from the enum, and assigning the associated value to `args`
and that you have access to it?
so is it safe to say that the setting of args is done at a higher level?
each defined type is what is "expected" for that call
i follow
you can define a strongly typed object around it but you dont have to use everything that object has
like a dynamic or a json object
Think of `match` like a `switch` statement, but the `enum` is richer than in C - in addition to a unique value, each of those unique values can have sub-properties, different ones depending on which value it is. Just like a `struct` or `class` or whatever from many other languages.
Hello. One question. i want to know if there is any way to staking a spl token created with the Solana Token Program. I am looking for the best on-chain way to stake an NFT and receive a reward in another spl token. It is possible to do it with the Stake Pool Program?
what i meant by lambda is that it gets treated as a formal parameter (as worded by someone else)
method declarations in an enum... that to me is more like an interface lol
yeah, an enum in rust is both exactly like i expect and not at all what i expect üòõ
no, not a lambda, you could rename `args` to `createMetadataAccountInstructionArguments` if you like... the `instruction` is basically a discriminated union, called an enum in rust: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html
so its a lambda definition in a way?
i.e. when the value of `instruction` (passed to the `match`) is `MetadataInstruction::CreateMetadataAccount` - such an instruction always has an associated value of type (whatever type args is), so please name it `args` so I can refer to it later (it accesses `args.data`)
Something like this?
```
/// Creates an CreateMetadataAccounts instruction
#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
pub fn create_metadata_accounts(
    program_id: Pubkey,
    metadata_account: Pubkey,
    mint: Pubkey,
    mint_authority: Pubkey,
    payer: Pubkey,
    update_authority: Pubkey,
    name: String,
    symbol: String,
    uri: String,
    creators: Option<Vec<Creator>>,
    seller_fee_basis_points: u16,
    update_authority_is_signer: bool,
    is_mutable: bool,
) -> Instruction {
    Instruction {
        program_id,
        accounts: vec![
            AccountMeta::new(metadata_account, false),
            AccountMeta::new_readonly(mint, false),
            AccountMeta::new_readonly(mint_authority, true),
            AccountMeta::new(payer, true),
            AccountMeta::new_readonly(update_authority, update_authority_is_signer),
            AccountMeta::new_readonly(solana_program::system_program::id(), false),
            AccountMeta::new_readonly(sysvar::rent::id(), false),
        ],
        data: MetadataInstruction::CreateMetadataAccount(CreateMetadataAccountArgs {
            data: Data {
                name,
                symbol,
                uri,
                seller_fee_basis_points,
                creators,
            },
            is_mutable,
        })
        .try_to_vec()
        .unwrap(),
    }
}
```
what populates it?
so is the data in the $[u8]?
That *is* the declaration of `args` - the `match` is like a `switch` on and the args is an associated value of that type.

Good question on where the `args` comes from... don't have MP on my machine otherwise I'd walk through it... there is a Meta plex Discord server however and someone drops an invite in this forum usually a few times a day
ohh it's too long
We are calling this metaplex func in a loop
Could you give a snippet?

theres no instantiation of args that i can find
im meaning args like as used in the highlighted line
No definition found
Hi, we are sending one transaction multiple times in a loop but the second time we get, Transaction failed: Already initialized, any idea what that means?
Look at the implementation of MetadataInstruction's `try_from_slice(...)`
is it just assumed that when making a call, you have access to a global variable called args that contains the data for the call?
where does args come from?
```pub fn process_instruction<'a>(
    program_id: &'a Pubkey,
    accounts: &'a [AccountInfo<'a>],
    input: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
    let instruction = MetadataInstruction::try_from_slice(input)?;
    match instruction {
        MetadataInstruction::CreateMetadataAccount(args) => {
            msg!("Instruction: Create Metadata Accounts");
            process_create_metadata_accounts(
                program_id,
                accounts,
                args.data,
                false,
                args.is_mutable,
            )
        }```
They may have more information about the NFT standard here https://discord.gg/metaplex
Yeah, they call it "Metadata" in a bunch of places
Solana's ERC-721 is likely found within metaplex
im actually looking to see if someone already has made the framework for actual ERC-721s
does that include a solana program? lol
fair, that is true
So you can import if you so wished elsewhere
What I am saying is that `tokens` that you linked is not a program on Solana, rather a CLI package for interacting with Solana.
yeah, i already have all of these repos being linked lol
If you're looking for the spl token program, it is found here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/program
Yes
those who have access to the code, ergo, the project itself, right?
What you're looking at specifically is keeping things private internal to the crate. That's just granting access to code to those who need it
Unfortunately not at this time.
with the solana rpc api is it possible to filter by 2 memcmps?

so im trying to figure out why certain things have pub when they really dont need it unless its one of those "this has a lower visibility than what it references" error
im curious what you meant by this
It's not like Solidity if that's what you're thinking, no. The public/private don't determine what is callable. Also, you can only write calling programs, read is done through json rpc
if im defining the instruction sets explicitly, im not sure why accessors matter
why do i need pub vs private or whatever?
So, for these functions... the accessor (private, public, etc.) don't seem to be in the context of the transaction or the program being called but in just an internal context of the code that makes up the application... is this correct?
You could also use `logsSubscribe`. https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#logssubscribe Either way, yes, you will be parsing
but then id have to be actively parsing the logs for that
There's an active proposal on this https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/14076
Another way you could do it is use `msg!` in the program and parse the program log using `getTransaction`
is there anything to match?
What is solana's equivlant to emitting an event?
To echo what Trent is saying as well, you could try https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld and extend like this https://dev.to/cogoo/solana-how-to-send-custom-instructions-via-instruction-data-4g9g
been looking at bits and pieces of a bunch of different projects
I've got that cloned along with the dapp template
<@!256727262441766923> There's tons of examples here by the way https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library
token-swap, token, token-lending, and stake-pool all have js bindings that you can reference too, to understand more of how the client code interacts with the on chain programs.
It's just a `Trait` (interface)
https://docs.rs/solana-program/1.8.2/solana_program/program_pack/trait.Pack.html
is `Pack` what the process of unpacking the instruction set is called?
i have no idea what this means üòõ
Manual packing is most efficient, but... manual
while taking the structure of more complex programs in mind as i go along
You don't strictly _have_ to use the `Pack` interface for serialization, BTW
thats basically what im doing
Start with helloworld.  Make it multi-instruction
Id take the navy rust anyday lol
friend
Generics are your firend
Yep
Yes, this was my first Rust adventure....
I do see that i can use generics which should be nice
its very different from what im used to in terms of coding (C#/TSQL)
i think i need to work on getting a contract to route to methods i need and to decide how i want to approach this
i think i have a decent handle on entry level error stuff based on examples
Keep the questions coming, lots of help in this forum... I got my 'legs' here as well
hahaha
or participate in mandatory fun
just as long as i dont have to stand by to stand by
lol im a navy vet. aye is fine üòõ
yes
aye
the match is a switch, ya?
Its a bit messy, but the program folder has all the makings
It is in a template I wrote: https://github.com/hashblock/solana-cli-program-template
in a way you're creating a switch, no?
i think i see what you're doing here
are these your examples or from a source i can look at?
```rust
pub fn process(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
    msg!("Received process request");
    // Check the account for program relationship
    if let Err(error) = check_account_ownership(program_id, accounts) {
        return Err(error);
    }
    // Unpack the inbound data, mapping instruction to appropriate structure
    let instruction = ProgramInstruction::unpack(instruction_data)?;
    match instruction {
        ProgramInstruction::InitializeAccount => initialize_account(accounts),
        ProgramInstruction::MintToAccount { key, value } => {
            mint_keypair_to_account(accounts, key, value)
        }
        ProgramInstruction::TransferBetweenAccounts { key } => {
            transfer_keypair_to_account(accounts, key)
        }
        ProgramInstruction::BurnFromAccount { key } => burn_keypair_from_account(accounts, key),
        ProgramInstruction::MintToAccountWithFee { key, value } => {
            mint_keypair_to_account_with_fee(accounts, key, value)
        }
        ProgramInstruction::TransferBetweenAccountsWithFee { key } => {
            transfer_keypair_to_account_with_fee(accounts, key)
        }
        ProgramInstruction::BurnFromAccountWithFee { key } => {
            burn_keypair_from_account_with_fee(accounts, key)
        }
    }
}
```
Your process entry point
just inside the programresult?
what calls unpack?
So the unpack is called with the &[u8] from the entrypoint
hey im trying to execute a transfer using token::Transfer for a token with mint decimal of 4 (instead of 9) and the tx fails due to insufficient funds but i have the funds available in the depositing account?
where do i get the argument values if all i have is program id, accounts, and instruction data?
Here example following the enum above:
```rust
impl ProgramInstruction {
    /// Unpack inbound buffer to associated Instruction
    /// The expected format for input is a Borsh serialized vector
    pub fn unpack(input: &[u8]) -> Result<Self, ProgramError> {
        let block = Vec::<Vec<u8>>::try_from_slice(input).unwrap();
        match block[0][0] {
            0 => Ok(ProgramInstruction::InitializeAccount),
            1 => Ok(Self::MintToAccount {
                key: String::try_from_slice(&block[1])?,
                value: String::try_from_slice(&block[2])?,
            }),
            2 => Ok(Self::TransferBetweenAccounts {
                key: String::try_from_slice(&block[1])?,
            }),
            3 => Ok(Self::BurnFromAccount {
                key: String::try_from_slice(&block[1])?,
            }),
            4 => Ok(Self::MintToAccountWithFee {
                key: String::try_from_slice(&block[1])?,
                value: String::try_from_slice(&block[2])?,
            }),
            5 => Ok(Self::TransferBetweenAccountsWithFee {
                key: String::try_from_slice(&block[1])?,
            }),
            6 => Ok(Self::BurnFromAccountWithFee {
                key: String::try_from_slice(&block[1])?,
            }),
            _ => Err(SampleError::DeserializationFailure.into()),
        }
    }
}
```
ok so its an array of numbers...
So, when you unpack the &[u8] you pull the u8 or u16 or whatever and match that number with the enum offset and populate the struct constructor with the argument values, then dispatch that as your instruction function
so how does it grab the arguments?
so this enum is acting like an interface?
Right, i see that, exampled here in metaplex's auction program
```rust
pub enum ProgramInstruction {
    InitializeAccount,
    MintToAccount { key: String, value: String },
    TransferBetweenAccounts { key: String },
    BurnFromAccount { key: String },
    MintToAccountWithFee { key: String, value: String },
    TransferBetweenAccountsWithFee { key: String },
    BurnFromAccountWithFee { key: String },
}
```
Correct. There's a good overview of the loader found here https://jstarry.notion.site/Program-deploys-29780c48794c47308d5f138074dd9838
`processor::process_instruction(program_id, accounts, instruction_data)` is this using the definition from before?
```pub use crate::processor::{
    cancel_bid::CancelBidArgs, claim_bid::ClaimBidArgs, create_auction::CreateAuctionArgs,
    create_auction_v2::CreateAuctionArgsV2, end_auction::EndAuctionArgs, place_bid::PlaceBidArgs,
    start_auction::StartAuctionArgs,
};```
ok so what im not understanding is how in this example, that u8 is being spread out into that enum with the arguments and all of that
```#![cfg(all(target_arch = "bpf", not(feature = "no-entrypoint")))]

use {
    crate::{errors::AuctionError, processor},
    solana_program::{
        account_info::AccountInfo, entrypoint, entrypoint::ProgramResult, msg,
        program_error::PrintProgramError, pubkey::Pubkey,
    },
};

entrypoint!(process_instruction);
fn process_instruction(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
    if let Err(error) = processor::process_instruction(program_id, accounts, instruction_data) {
        error.print::<AuctionError>();
        msg!("{}", error);
        return Err(error);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```
fair. well then i dont think im coming even close to that cap yet which is conforting
Someone here can confirm, don't think the deploy of the program (contract) is costing execution units... just more Lamports based on size
Im pretty sure ill find out soon =/
yeah, so far i havent hit that cap, even with deploying contracts lol
During dev you can log units consumed through your instruction path, or dev/test net
eg i dont know what 200k really looks like
How can i realistically look at that 200k?
id love to do something like that here with the concept i have in mind
I basically really like the concepts of EIP-998 (an NFT that can own ERC20/721 on its own) and EIP-3525 (being able to "break" one NFT down into multiple pieces, merge those pieces into bigger pieces, etc.)
No, what I mean is for a single instruction, the more complex it gets the higher the 'execution unit' cost, of which there is a 200 K cap
a lot of the stuff will be simple transfers or math calculations
if the cost of the total transaction is under like a dollar for some really complex calculations and stuff... im okay with that
I could do a u16 if I wanted
<@!256727262441766923> Also not that a single U8 for the instruction isn't a constraint either.... You could have more than 255 functions in a single program but then there may be other costs
i dont understand what those listed numbers are
I still need to deep dive to see how the functions and implementations and all of that actually map/wire up
Correct
Yes
```use crate::{EXTENDED, PREFIX};
use borsh::{BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};

    start_auction::StartAuctionArgs,

```
it seems like the way this is achieved is through the instructions u8 thing and what im seeing is that people map an enum to implementations or functions with argument objects and then create a processor crate with the callable "functions"?
im trying to make sure i understand how one program has "multiple callable functions"
i have a pending question that id like to figure out
hahaha yeah, i hit that wall yesterday
There's a NFT standard using Metaplex right now. ERC20 is very much like the token program. I will mention though, solidity vs Solana Programming is very different
im talking a real ERC721
like how SPL Token is for ERC20 and they emulate ERC721 by locking the quantity to 1
out of curiosity, are there programs out there like the SPL Token specifically for other ERCs?
im very curious though
im not sure how that all works tbh
i would think that anything they do to interact with your NFT (such as selling it on a market for you) would incur a royalty of some kind
when its being auctioned, does it still show in your possession?
well, do you complete a transaction with solsea?
Right, I would have thought that minting yourself via cli and then just uploading to Solsea would be cheaper ....
if it sells, they get a cut
i think solsea and other places collect a royalty for minting your nft for you
Is there a cost difference between minting solana nfts via cli/node etc. vs the marketplace GUI interfaces like Solsea?
can i accomplish the same thing with solana that i can with solidity? Does solidity follow the ERC20/721/etc specs or is it the wild west out here?
i mean, i get that smart contracts are expensive as far as transactions go but this would be more overhead, no?
i assume that a project like this skyrockets the costs of a transaction because of all the bootstrapping that has to take place, no?
It's not immediately though. They haven't released anything other than on devnet/testnet
this is a godsend if i can get this squared away
I started writing solidity contracts before switching yesterday
Yes
Also, both of ya'll are welcome to ask any questions you come up with here
meaning my solidity contracts will work here?
Neon is building an evm proxy on Solana
?
Be sure to check out Neon then üëç
Yeah seriously. It's a cool system but much different than the stuff I've worked on in the past
Solidity would be great with solana's transaction fees
There's a steep learning curve here
No worries I'm also confused about many things üòõ
im still very blue to all of this so im mainly asking questions to learn. Trying to follow along üòõ
(The "wallet" here is a hardware wallet running its own firmware)
No? It would just add signatures to a transaction object
or is this all dapp side?
wont doing transactions like that on-chain reveal private keys or other confidential information?
Right the plan is to determine which accounts need to sign in JS and then pass those references to the wallet, which will make the signatures if it can find the keys.
what would be nice is if we ran spl-token create-multisig a1 a2 a3 and got a4 that we could use as the "owner" which would grant permissions to the addresses used to make the multisig so that way any of the three original accounts would validate properly
in that particular case, yes they would require the signers for those keys. thats 1 specific instruction. but the wallet itself, unless providing multi sign capability itself, would not necessarily be providing the signatures for each of those signers. it depends on the transaction. and where the signers need to come from.
Well, that would really only be for things like notarization or contractual agreements where both/all parties must be present and accept?
Also correct, but with an extra cost on storage if needed.
That is correct
a transaction does have N signers. thats how the transaction cost is calculated. 0.005 (i think) sol per signer
I'm not clear either haha. I'm probably misunderstanding something.

My understanding is that a transaction has `N` signers. That set includes every unique account who is marked as a "signer" on one or more instructions. For example, here's an instruction I printed out from a local copy of Sollet:

```
    {
      "keys": [
        {
          "pubkey": {
            "_bn": "63e8ee43a8583013ba6fef5c09181f26720d0621debe8c57eaf4ed87e704843b"
          },
          "isSigner": true,
          "isWritable": true
        },
        {
          "pubkey": {
            "_bn": "f7fa7a4d4e8dda19a3afbec13a5fb4a540289b869b6a5a46162b7c3e3d9161ab"
          },
          "isSigner": true,
          "isWritable": true
        }
      ],
      "programId": {
        "_bn": "00"
      },
      "data": {
        "type": "Buffer",
        "data": [
          0,   0,   0,   0,  96,  77,  22,   0,   0,  0,   0,
          0,  82,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,  6, 221,
          246, 225, 215, 101, 161, 147, 217, 203, 225, 70, 206,
          235, 121, 172,  28, 180, 133, 237,  95,  91, 55, 145,
          58, 140, 245, 133, 126, 255,   0, 169
        ]
      }
    }, 
```

See how both `keys` are marked as `isSigner=true`? I assumed this meant that both of those accounts would need to sign the entire transaction or it would not be verifiable by consensus.
im looking at the metaplex demo code and the spl repo so im getting familiar with the structure... i just want to make sure i understand the concepts
not really clear on this.  a wallet should only provide 1 signature if its not multi sig.  so when you say sign N times, for 1 wallet, for 1 signature, not really clear on that.
Anyone able to help me confirm this?
No no not getting into multisig for this just yet üòÖ
Yeah the intention is just to infer which accounts need to sign a transaction based on the `Transaction` object. Then our wallet would serialize the transaction, sign `N` times (once per requested key), and return the signatures.
looks like what you do is batch the three signers into a single signer and use that
https://spl.solana.com/token#multisig-usage
thats at the transaction level though.  for wallets, they have to support their end of adding multiple signatures. if thats the intention
from what i've read, it can have multiple signers
it is the case.  multi sign is supported out of the box
The GridPlus Lattice (hardware wallet). This is pretty early specing and I'm not super familiar with Solana so just trying to get the lay of the land.

Interesting... I thought a message could have multiple signers (similar to a BTC tx having multiple signed inputs by potentially different keys). Is that not the case? My tx header shows: `numRequiredSignatures: 3`. Where do the other 2 come from?
`solana program show programid`  pointing to the network in question and program
My next question is to confirm my understanding of "function implementation"... we have the entry point that takes a u8 for instructions that we define through an enum with some attributes decorating it, ya? we then crate a processor for each of the methods we want to implement?
wallet integration for what? and a wallet is only 1 signer, usually the payer, not multiple signers, so unless its multi sig that may be different right? Otherwise, you will have to look into the particular calls or programs your building transactions for in order to fill in the required signers.
there is not currently an etherscan equiv for program viewing the same way. anchor framework has been working on and has better current facilities for using programs and getting interfaces to programs with the IDL. Currently others will publish their interfaces or provide SDKs if they have a stronger intention of others using it. If programs do not use anchor and do not publish it would be more difficult to use them.
On localnet how can I check if a program with a specific program_id is deployed?
my dapp is essentially calling my own program using their credentials for signing and stuff, right?
If i write a program(s), am I the only intended user or am i to expect others to call the program?
Speaking of, is there a solana equivalent of etherscan validation? Is the code ever published?
point solana over solidity... security through obscurity... if people can't properly construct a transaction to your program/contract, you don't have to worry about them copying it lol
I'm working on a wallet integration. I need to serialize the message and then sign it with `N` keys in an HD wallet
there is no query as far as I know, you would probably need to be familiar with what you are calling to properly construct the transaction.  what are you trying to do.
Found this in the metaplex demo code
```impl FromStr for Pubkey {
    type Err = ParsePubkeyError;

    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        if s.len() > MAX_BASE58_LEN {
            return Err(ParsePubkeyError::WrongSize);
        }
        let pubkey_vec = bs58::decode(s)
            .into_vec()
            .map_err(|_| ParsePubkeyError::Invalid)?;
        if pubkey_vec.len() != mem::size_of::<Pubkey>() {
            Err(ParsePubkeyError::WrongSize)
        } else {
            Ok(Pubkey::new(&pubkey_vec))
        }
    }
}```
they have been good estimates in my experience
If I have an instance of a web3.js `Transaction` and I want to find out which accounts need to sign the message, what is the best way of doing that? I need a list of only addresses that will be signing (i.e. exclude those that do not need to sign).

I'm at a loss because `TransactionInstruction` `keys` do not indicate whether the key indices are signers or readonly

Edit: I'm actually looking at the `CompiledInstruction` type, as this is now a compiled transaction object. Same question though - how do I distinguish between signers and readonly accounts?
Thanks. Do you know about other ways how to retrieve account structure?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Is there a way to do a division between 2 BNs while keeping 2 digits a precision? BN.js discards the floating part.
So my new issue is ```failed to verify account E24Jy1VyftnrAkRRr1Hgm8k25CyCQk4xcBWKhbzvxsjo: instruction modified data of an account it does not own```

Invoking a CPI with ```msg!("Invoking update_stats_instruction with program_id: {}.", &game_metadata_program_id.key.to_string());

    invoke(
        &game_metadata::instruction::update_stats_instruction(
            *game_metadata_program_id.key,
            *opponent_member_account_info.key,
            *payer_account_info.key,
            new_stats
        ),
        &[game_metadata_program_id.clone(), opponent_member_account_info.clone(), payer_account_info.clone()],
    /*&[&payer_account_info]*/)?;```

To an instruction function of ```pub fn process_update_stats<'a>(
    program_id: &'a Pubkey,
    accounts: &'a [AccountInfo<'a>],
    new_stats: Stats,
) -> ProgramResult {
    msg!("Entering process_update_stats");
    let account_info_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let metadata_account_info = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
    let payer_account_info = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;

    msg!("Program ID is {} and owner of {} is {}.",
        &program_id.to_string(),
        &metadata_account_info.key.to_string(),
        &metadata_account_info.owner.to_string()
    );

    let mut metadata = GameMetadata::from_account_info(&metadata_account_info).unwrap();
    msg!("Curr Stats: {}", &metadata.curr_stats.health.to_string());
    msg!("New Stats: {}", &new_stats.health.to_string());

    metadata.curr_stats = new_stats.clone();

    metadata.serialize(&mut *metadata_account_info.data.borrow_mut())?;

    Ok(())
}```
Seems like it should work because the instruction is defined in the account that owns the metadata. This is verified by the printout

Might be a n00b questions: I'm using wallet-adapter-react to create a frontend application. How do I get the user who connects their wallet to sign a transaction? The example I see in the github repo mentions signMention for verifying transactions or offline, etc.; and the only other examples I see that include a signer make use of an Keypair auto-generated by the program

Hi guys, what is the best UI for swaps & adding liquidity would you recommend to fork?
Some context: we've built our own market model with liquidity pools using standard tokenSwapProgram. 
Oysters UI seems to be deprecated. (https://github.com/project-serum/oyster-swap) 
Any recommendations?
Thanks!!! I already made the comment on the token repository github. Wish me luck ü§ûüèª
yes
and then i get the last accountkeys?
use `getTransaction` on the last signature
Mmm and how do i get the last place from the last transaction
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress
I don't know if there is a better way, but you could use `getSignaturesForAddress` on the mint and get the last place it was from the last transaction
I think you can do something like this `nacl.sign.detached.verify(msg Uint8Array, signature Uint8Array, publicKey Uint8Array)`
No one?
hmmm that's interesting! There is some documentation where can I learn how to do that?
You could require the user to sign with their wallet and verify the signature on your backend
I've seen that and seems to be cool, and I can use that on frontend...So I get see if the solana app is "connected" (through somehow like "window.solana.isConnected" in javascript). 

But I want to make a request to a backend app and generate a kind of token (or something like that) to "authenticate" the user, and in this case, some malicious user change the window.solana._pubKey to any pubKey (or wallet) that he wants to access and send it to backend, so he would be logged in without the proper permission...

How do i get the current owner of a NFT having its mint address?
anyone?
Check with the example repos. As you can see here, it is unpacking using the struct. https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/5f4b735796881a8d341df1f2462414683864d7db/token/program/src/processor.rs#L40
I'm not as well versed at Rust, but it looks like it is using the struct to deserialize the data into an object
So how do I read this account.data in rust properly....
So this is how the accountData is sent. messages here is a vector<dataType>
Its not instructionData it is just accountData
So it depends on how the program is serializing the data

How do i parse account.data.value that is received in a rust smart contract?
I see it is in an array with 2 digit numbers..can someone help on how to read/parse it properly?
I tried the following and it resulted in the correct mint info:
```
const connection = new Connection(
      clusterApiUrl('devnet'),
      'confirmed'
);

const payer = Keypair.generate();


const token = new Token(
      connection,
      new PublicKey('33MSqqAnvwWVCuq28wNv6WMpmLEscSJ4BMxJXSXcJgnW'),
      TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
      payer
);

const mintInfo = await token.getMintInfo();

console.log(mintInfo);
```
`nft` is what does it. You may have to update to show up as a token again
What account are you sending?

I thought that was odd. I'm not doing too much. This is also a custom Metadata unrelated to Metaplex. It looks like I forgot to set the account writable in my Typescript and doing that fixed it. Thank you for your help!

So the main problem is that we just can't use the program library APIs to pull the account data because reasons?
Checking into this
You can use what was posted and just use the rpc api methods instead of ts. You will still have to deserialize the account data using whatever is done in unity though
yeah we are on unity so right now we have to use curl or any other supported tech to get this data... on worst case we have to setup a server only to get the metadata which feels bad
This can get the arweave metadata/links given a wallet address https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/get-account-nfts/getAccountNFTs.ts
Hey All, hoping to get some help with a problem I've been having. I'm attempting to call the getMintInfo from the solana program library on a token mint account I've created on the dev net. 

https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/81c90f5c73732536c4b27f8139f4299bed06e93a/token/js/client/token.js#L725

Token account I'm trying to call this on is 33MSqqAnvwWVCuq28wNv6WMpmLEscSJ4BMxJXSXcJgnW on devnet.

Anyone have any idea why the call to getMintInfo is failing? The only things I can think of are that something in getAccountInfo is failing to find data in the token account I pass in, or there's something fishy going on with the connection that the method is using, but I'm not sure where to start.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#accountsubscribe
You could try subscribing to your account and parsing the changes
JSON array order is preserved
You should be able to watch an account like that, yes
`consumed 200000 of 200000 compute units` Looks like your ran out of compute units for what you're doing. Also looks like your trying to do CPI and hitting unauthorized. Try asking Metaplex about their program https://discord.gg/metaplex

What did you set in token-list? I believe there is a way to set as NFT vs token

Hey guys, does anybody know the steps to get the arweave link from a token with the solana curl methods?

here is a example link https://explorer.solana.com/address/43zT9YZWCrqAK3hWW96QxYyHrVDkygxhtxKNzWexFrCw/metadata?cluster=devnet

we tried curl the explorer.solana website but it use javascript and its not supported. there is also no other api to gather the informations
Hi all, I need to setup a script to monitor a certain wallet address I own. It would burn any NFTs that are sent to the wallet & also match my list of Token Mints - a Burn wallet if you will.

It would then airdrop another SPL token back to the NFT senders wallet.

The airdrop & burn CLI commands I have down. Just wondering how I can setup the listener for incoming transactions (plain old loop to poll is fine) & extract the Token Mint & senders wallet to pass into the next stage?
Hi, does anyone know if https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getMultipleAccountsInfo guarantees that the array of AccountInfo in the result is ordered same as the input keys?
yes that's right
So... I've been watching transactions from an account using `getConfirmedSignaturesFromAddress2` each second... are you telling me that I could be using `onLogs` all this time? Avoiding making 2.5m requests per month only to keep the "watcher" running? üòÑ
I'm having a lot of trouble getting CPI to work in my NFT battler. It keeps failing with ```Dsg8AF5M2Cr1dMTzF7AvssLjNzqobFZ7zsnaEPd6ArHW's writable privilege escalated
    Program 4RKZfwgWxUz1XEmgPnYkZTSQpzaKGPS9pnGbPTghbZyQ consumed 200000 of 200000 compute units
    Program 4RKZfwgWxUz1XEmgPnYkZTSQpzaKGPS9pnGbPTghbZyQ failed: Cross-program invocation with unauthorized signer or writable account```.

I have a Battle contract which tracks the battle states and has the pubkeys for the metadata for all the battling NFTs. Once a battle round is complete I'm trying to execute a CPI to update the NFT's health in the metadata. Here is the invoke call that happens in a Battle smart contract instruction:
```invoke(
        &game_metadata::instruction::update_stats_instruction(
            Pubkey::from_str("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS").unwrap(),
            *opponent_member_account_info.key,
            *payer_account_info.key,
            new_stats
        ),
        &[opponent_member_account_info.clone(), payer_account_info.clone()],
    /*&[&payer_account_info]*/)?;```
Which is trying to call the UpdateStats instruction in the Metadata smart contract:
```pub fn update_stats_instruction(
    program_id: Pubkey,
    metadata_account: Pubkey,
    payer_account: Pubkey,
    new_stats: Stats,
) -> Instruction {
    msg!("Entering update_stats_instruction");
    let metadata_account_meta = AccountMeta::new(metadata_account, false);
    msg!("Created metadata_account_meta");
    let payer_account_meta = AccountMeta::new_readonly(payer_account, false);
    msg!("Created payer_account_meta");
    Instruction {
        program_id,
        accounts: vec![metadata_account_meta, payer_account_meta],
        data: GameMetadataInstruction::UpdateStats(UpdateStatsArgs{new_stats}).try_to_vec().unwrap(),
    }
}```
Any insight into what I'm doing wrong would be greatly appreciated!

Hi All 

Can anyone  help me to build a basic mint NFT with help of SPL Token or Solana programs?

I know EVM-based smart contracts(ERC 721 ).  New to Solana

please share the references
the docs are in the code!  i dont believe there is too much more than that and the spl atm.
hi, is there any documentation available on the fees for the token swap program? https://spl.solana.com/token-swap
Check the docs (Rust, JSON RPC or Web3): https://docs.solana.com/introduction
How it can be done
There are events you can 'subscribe' to that will call an off-chain listener
That I know of
Seems like you would need to manage the period of time triggers off-chain as there is no program capability to 'trigger' some action based on time events
Thanks man! By chance do you know if there is a way to give an `Address Label` to the program? I see certain programs having it on the Solana explorer
Its not like that I need to stake the 10% of token every period of time using the smart contract rust
Do you mean you want to change the behavior of the existing Token program?
Hey guys, I am developing an app integrated to solana (it will have a frontend maybe in react and backend in python) and I want to list all tokens only if the user is connected to it's wallet. I've found a endpoint (https://spl.solana.com/token#finding-all-token-accounts-for-a-wallet) that lists all tokens from a wallet, but I want to ensure that user is logged in to access those tokens in a specific wallet.... Anyone knows how can I ensure that?

Hi team,
I'm trying to create the smart contract for SPL Token in Solana

How do i get a metadata of an nft having its mints publikey?
Besides the current budget constrains (transaction size, execution units, memory and account data size) not likely but I believe some of these are potentially being increased. However; the bigger issue is the math required typically requirement 'modular math' functions that don't exist in the BPF instructions.
Quick question, are there any dapps on solana doing Deep learning? Was wondering if we could fit a neural net given the tight runtime and memory constraints of solana programs.
Can someone assist me please. I sent USDC from Phantom Wallet to Binance Wallet about 9 hours ago. On explorer it shows that it is finalised but I have not received as yet in Binance account.

Hi, I'm the CTO at Beemup, we are well-funded metaverse project. Due to limited knowledge of Rust, we are first launching a bep-20 token on bsc and then bridge it later on to a wrapped spl token. 
However, if possible we want to launch directly as a native spl token. This token should include vesting and a dashboard for investors to redeem these tokens. 

Is there someone who could help me with this?

hey! trying to install yarn through node.js with
>npm install --global yarn
but it's not working and instead gives me this:
but this is per transaction, i thought this could become actually per IX if you only use one instruction rather than 5
and we have considered all options extensively, the current decision is an off-chain on-chain batching computation, but still the chain compute spend is hard cap that limits the size of my batch
and trust me, I love writing Rust
no, it's not, i'd rather write business logic than go around system constraints if I don't have to, especially since transaction cost is not tied to compute budget spent, solving hard problems is something engineers love to do but ultimately I want to provide a utility to the users more than I want to spend time writing Rust

its a signer i.e has to be a `KeyPair` the person responsible for paying gas. i.e creating token

Which would explain your logs if your test localnet was running on v1.8.2 (start with 200k compute budget, consume 71k then have 128k budget remaining, consume 71k) as the budget is shared over transactions.
Whereas on mainnet - budget is 200k per instruction.
Sorry I think I misinterpreted the source code. I had another look and saw this : <https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7200c5106e0bb77b11ace5e0faffd926081535c8/runtime/src/bank.rs#L3854>. Which implies that compute budget per transaction is indeed 200k.
Fixed.

`solana-keygen grind --help` help you find your specific prefix address
`solana program deploy <your-program.so> --program-id <your-keypair.json>`
can deploy your program to the address.
I figured out a workaround for this and filed a ticket: https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold/issues/79
Following on from this - is a good approach just to open a pull request against the solana repo?
Also, is there a way to give an `Address Label` to the program?

Hi, how can I give a specific prefix to my program id when I deploy it?
Hello again.  Something really weird happened to me.  Create a token with the slp token program.  I minted a couple and it showed up fine on the phanton wallet.  But now that I uploaded the image and the name to the token, the phanton is taking it to me as an NFT and not a fungible token.  Any ideas that I did wrong?
I've been thinking of a way to do subscription payments in Solana, but then thought an alternative would be to use a token or NFT that has an expiration date. (So if you sign up for a 1 year "subscription" you get a membership NFT with an expiration date of today+1 year). Then you just check their wallet to make sure they have one to grant access to something. Does that make sense or is there a better way to do this?
thank uuuu
for sure
anyway, should be able to ref the source codes as well. wouldnt use anything without review and test first, risky.
im sure there are more on github. seach the history here or metaplex should find something.

just sending tokens to people from a list or spreadsheet basically
or could anyone help me figure out how?
does anyone in here know of a method to airdrop tokens in bulk distribution?
Isn't an alternative architecture for heavy processing a better idea - for example it could be done with verified off-chain processing... a preparatory transaction could specify inputs and a pubkey of someone authorised to do the processing, and a second transaction could later take the signed result and verify it.. or something like that, right?
and was looking for an update on that
I just happen to know that the team was planning 1 mil compute budget
it's implemented on master, but a few months out from being released and enabled on mainnet
as much as I would like to debate this, there is too much context I'd have to provide
Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x139
Anyone else with this error in metaplex when creating the candy machine?
It sounds like such an idea should be considered very very carefully, if at all. The primary use of it would be crappy/lazy development.
Finding creative ways to achieve things in a constrained architecture sounds better. What use-case would need more?
sure I do üôÇ
also, you've got the seed phrase for your main id somewhere safe, so you can always recover that back to `id.json` if you do accidentally overwrite it
hi, are there any updates on lifting the transaction compute limit to 1 mil?
gotcha, thanks!
yeah - if you don't want that use `-o otherfile.json`
not overwriting my main id
which I don't want, I just wanna recover the temp id to redeploy
but by default it tries to overwrite .config/solana/id.json
It prompts you to type it in - you don't want to put seed phrases in commands as they'll be written to your history
its --help messages suggests no mean to specify a seed phrase

Rent is a bit confusing for me. According to others, it does effect the NFT after creation if you transfer it to an account without an exempt amount or spend your sol and go below the exempt amount after minting.
you should just be able to yarn and yarn start.  could try devnet as well. havent touched the scaffold in a minute, not able to troubleshoot or see rn. it looks like somthn related to the calls scaffold makes, network. accounts, params, is off somewhere.
hard to say, those accounts its tryn to query may not exist or jave diff parms locally. if your not able to comment some calls out or troubleshoot, the wallet adapter has examples have front end and wallet integration.  there are some other example UIs as well, and some more with anchor.
but my step to run app is right ?
yeahhhh
if your local validator running?
and run the app with yarn start
i change network in phantom to local, run yarn program:build and then yarn run localnet:up
<@!785084693023424542> tks for your reply, i just run the app and dont change anything
minimum rent is paid for on token account creation. so it should not affect your NFTs after it was created, in theory
hard to say. maybe some of the accounts being queried have change in some way.  you didnt change anything?  could also try a different network.  dapp scaffold runs several calls on start.
Hi, I'm parsing serialized data (using anchor events) emitted to the program log. However, in some cases users are sending many instructions leading for the program log to be truncated.
For example: <https://explorer.solana.com/tx/46dyFA53Q8ha5JEYin9vcaHrQJL2qbwD4rT5DWkwBnbfB35VNcKCx4VBA25nEHnYG46Q1aCKQecWinYJK6KfXwgB> - the second last line on the log is "Log truncated".
I can see that log messages are truncated after 10k bytes in the solana runtime code: <https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/b4ff488a0dc2c8e6dcb08598ba59e1dc1514187d/runtime/src/log_collector.rs#L3>
It would be great if this could be increased (say to 100k bytes) - is this feasible?
hello guys, im newbie to solana, i clone dapp-scaffold and run with yarn start, but i met this error, but dont know why

Looks like what you can do is set an upgrade authority and not set as immutable `--final` https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program#set-a-programs-upgrade-authority
deploying to a different program id indeed solved the problem
ok, now another question then: how is it that we can update a program if it is immutable?
`Once executable, the runtime enforces that the account's data (the program) is immutable`
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts#executable
Actually, looks like I may be wrong
but how does the blockchain keeps beeing verifiable if the program gets removed?
you can use `solana program close`
just to be sure: there is no possibility to "close" an executable account and gets its lamport back right?
Account resizing is not a thing today unfortunately. It is something being discussed though
yeah, never did that before. Thank you.
hmm I thought it would resize the old account on it's own. Good idea!
you get a raw JS arraybuffer, you can then use for instance the BN lib to convert these raw bytes into u64
damn, okay understood. not sure how to do that but I'll have a look...
<@!368314530729558024> has the correct answer, as there isn't a binding in web3.js today. If you do make this, you can probably make a PR so people can do what you're trying to do in the future
Are you redeploying your program? Seems like your current program account is not large enough
You can try deploying or upgrading to another program id with `solana program deploy your.so --program-id previoud-program-id`
I'm getting

```

```

in test validator log
then it is easy to unpack according to this layout: https://docs.rs/solana-program/1.8.2/solana_program/rent/struct.Rent.html
you get it like any account, its address is built in web3: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#SYSVAR_RENT_PUBKEY
or the rent required for an account per epoch
yeah, essentially that's my question. How can i get it with JS üôÇ
maybe getting the Rent sysvar data?
Another question: does one know how to convert an `Account` into an `AccountInfo`?
yes. but i want to have rent per day / epoch.
I want to find out how i could do that
on my local cluster
Why am I getting `Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 0: account data too small for instruction` when deploying a program with `solana program deploy` ?
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption
in JS you can still query the getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption RPC endpoint
yeah, i know
So it doesn't look like you can do it in js, but you can check via cli `solana rent 1000`
exempt = 2 years worth of rent
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts#rent-exemption
and what's the number of epochs that's calculated in the getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption function?
is there a way to get the rent per epoch in JS?
That's not necessarily true, as an epoch may last longer than 2 days.

is it possible to get the rent required for one epoch with <@903672351441444875>/web3.js?
I can only find the getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption function.
would just using it's result and dividing it by 365 (2 years of epochs) correct?
Both can use LLVM
I think there is more support, but you can do in either.
noob question - is there any particular reason to use Rust over C/C++? I'm already somewhat familiar with C/C++, but anecdotally everyone only talks about writing Programs in Rust
I also see nothing in the program code that would prevent it https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/instruction.rs#L890
So I just tried this out with the spl token lib and it worked. 0x1 seems to be insufficient funds to make the transaction
getting `0x1` from this case
it's failing for me and I want to find out if that's expected
if someone has a token balance of zero, and tries to do an SPL token transfer for zero, should it fail?
hey guys question about SPL token
thanks!
I would head over to metaplex's discord for this answer. https://discord.gg/metaplex
Hi, is it possible to mint/create NFTs of the same collection incrementally from the same account (over a longer time span), but still locking the supply to 1 max each? Basically my question is: Is it possible to only lock one token/nft minted by an account and not the whole account?
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress You have to iterate through them with this at this time
I used the full path and it works !!!!!!
like even if it has 1 week worth of alot of tx's?
is there a quick and easy way to get the first transaction ever for a given address?
hello devs
it does, but i'm going to try the full path and let you know when it works.
My path: `Keypair Path: /Users/jacobcg/.config/solana/id.json`
Just checking, the keypair at that path exists? A bit odd, since my path is the full path on `solana config get`
This my config setup
Taking a look into this
It's not really `rent is collected` in your case. An account can maintain a minimum balance that equals 2 years of payments to be exempt from collections. You can find more info here https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/rent

Often times the whatever you're using to transfer just inits the account with the minimum balance to be exempt from rent. This is only done once as long as that's what the implementation is doing
<@!489206164270350337> Rent is collected only for the first transfer of SOL into a new account?
`No such file or directory (os error 2) `
but still getting the same error whenever i try to create a token
so i ensured my config is setup
thanks!
Yep https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#simulateTransaction
when using sendTransaction in web3 is there a simulated transaction? instead off actually doing it
thank you, best of luck to you too üëç
Best of luck
appreciate your response though
I'll check their SDK though, I didn't looked that way
I asked the guys over there few times, but nobody answered
You could probably do something with the metaplex sdk. I am not knowledgable on metaplex though, so I would check the metaplex discord https://discord.gg/metaplex
is there a way to mint without the frontend, and doing it through nodejs solana library ? even doing it with spl-token CLI would be a start
I have created a candy machine with metaplex, and using the exiled apes react frontend for minting
<@!489206164270350337> I have a question, maybe you can point me in the right direction
thank you so much!
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getminimumbalanceforrentexemption
?
how can i know the price of rent
Ok
Rent
why?
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3mx8XfKKwJHk3r5gezhedyzZTaDYgyA31jWp7DTfvifRJkouaA7kWwcReP1XRCvyAXeAgsUWQrTQffhR8rWHHCvN
as you can see here
Hi!
I have a very simple question.
I did a transfer of 0.0001 SOL but the post balance is only 0.000097561
üôèüèø
Make sure all the required config is set correctly https://spl.solana.com/token#configuration
Kind of a hack
Doesn't look to be supported at this time. You could do some funky stuff like forward local:8899 to your rpc host and change the network to local on phantom though
Also i already have rust and the solana tool suite installed
Not sure why < spl-token create token > isn't working
thanks got it solved

Currently Phantom uses whatever RPC the website is using to interact. Some sites allow you do input a custom RPC
Phantom should have an import for the private key. You'll have to find it in the id.json file on your system
You can run something like `solana program show <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` on devnet to get the account size and use `getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption` with the account size to get the amount of SOL needed
This is kind of a noob question but how do NFTs and rent work?  If the account owner doesn‚Äôt have enough sol to be exempt or pay rent, could the account and NFTs be purged?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I just want to run the CLI for generating keys and signing, (not do dev on that machine).
Ok.. so I spent a loooong time yesterday trying to compile all of rust/solana on an old raspberry pi 1, but it doesn't build.. is it actually possible to run solana on a 32-bit machine? I also have an old (intel) 32-bit mac-mini I can try on instead of the pi, but would be handy to know in advance if it's not going to work
No, see https://explorer.solana.com/
Is it true?
?
Sol has 20 million of coin
How to send USDC or any other Solana tokens through solana/web3.js? Right now I can send SOLs but not any other token
(and to be clear, it's actually `solana program deploy` that's hanging while using the test-validator locally)
Anyone ever experience the test-validator hanging on finalizing transactions or have thoughts on how to debug? Logs are showing transactions are going through, but they never complete
the function is looking for a Keypair as argoments, idk why said 'public key' then..
hi friends! sorry if there has already been asked: are there good resources on lazy minting NFTs on solana like how you can on opensea?
yep
wdym?
do you have any resources?
Quicknode doesn't have it, just wanna make sure the right one to get a subscription
Do you have any tips on working with quicknode?
between figment, rpcnodes, quicknodes, and titan you should be able to find somthn.
solanapy and serumpy, links in dev resources, there may be others.  <#763249718339567626>  for doing a lot or historical you likepy need another rpc node like quickonode or others
Hey guys, anyone knows an RPC that supports devnet airdrops?
Which Python library/API do you recommend for interacting with the Solana blockchain?

Particularly if I want to analyze data from the blockchain?
That should cover setting up the transaction... as far as getting the wallet to sign it, I have no idea - maybe there's a std way to do that or maybe each wallet has an interface.
I haven't started looking into this side of it yet, mostly how the core tech works, and a bit on how smart contracts are written... but I think you need to call the RPC API which can be done conveniently and easily from the JS bindings, docs are here: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-api
im trying to make a function on my test website, where user have to just click on a button to transfer a fixed amount of SOLANA, like 0.1$ to a fixed address after confirmation. 
tried with solana transfer but unable to use it correctly..
Solana transfer  <SOL AMMOUNT> <RECIEVING ADDRESS> --allow-unfunded-recipient --url https://api.devnet.solana.com/ --fee-payer my_solana_wallet2.json
this is the code i have been using
and its working fine with terminal
but how can i use it inside HTML 
like, when user clickthe button, it'll execute and to give it access to wallets
Is there a way to fetch all the events emitted using emit! by a program similar to web3 fetchEvents?
You can pass whatever data you like into your program - I'm still learning though so not sure how much you can do on-chain, but if two tokens (or tokens+sol etc) are in the signers account, I think you should be able to read/verify that the input-tokens are indeed present in the account before proceeding.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-api#creating-and-sending-transactions

how about the example from docs on js client?
anyone??
have a stupid question - if instruction only modifies an already allocated account then the transaction fee is zero, right?
hi, can anyone help me in a code.
im trying to make a function on my test website, where user have to just click on a button to transfer a fixed amount of SOLANA, like 0.1$ to a fixed address after confirmation. 
tried with solana transfer but unable to use it correctly..
has anybody got any good code examples of transactions that require multiple inputs (i.e. more than one token, or a token and SOL, etc)
Hi, I have a simple UI where I need to interact with a program function.
I have imported the required stuff from anchor libraries and wallet-adapter. Setup is something like this..

```
import { Program, Provider, web3 } from '@project-serum/anchor';
import { useAnchorWallet, useConnection, useWallet } from '@sola#9388na/wallet-adapter-react';
```

I tried to create a provider object with the wallet object from useWallet.

```
const wallet = useWallet();
const provider = new Provider(connection,wallet,Provider.defaultOptions());
```

My issue is provider.wallet.publicKey is null is after I do this.
It is the same even when I use 
`const wallet = useAnchorWallet()`

Any insights?
This a is very interesting idea/approach. I was trying to think of similar things for gaming purposes, but I need to learn more before I can figure it all out üôÇ - I'd be interested to keep up with how you're getting on with this.
Hey! did you know the answer to this? also wondering
our mint was yesterday, it's all done now (hence the rate limit I guess ^^')
cause I can wait a day it's ok
or do I have to explicitly contact the endpoint host?
is this supposed to be temporary?
There should be a contact email somewhere in the response body, the endpoints are hosted on runnode I believe.
Ah ha, you were right, you have been rate-limited.
`HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
access-control-max-age: 86400
access-control-allow-origin: *
content-length: 136
cache-control: no-cache
content-type: application/json
access-control-allow-methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS
connection: close`
Your Suggestion worked! Changing the connection did it. Here's how we were initializing the connection:

const connection = new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com');

Changing it to your suggestion worked:

const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl('devnet'), 'confirmed');

It looks like we needed to define a commitment. Thanks <@!489206164270350337> !!!
Try adding `-D -` then run the whole command in your terminal.
Those are the request headers, the response is important.
``msg!`` uses inside  ``pringln!``?
`curl "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/" -X OPTIONS -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:94.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/94.0" -H "Accept: */*" -H "Accept-Language: fr,fr-FR;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3" --compressed -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: content-type" -H "Referer: https://pixtapes.com/" -H "Origin: https://pixtapes.com" -H "Connection: keep-alive" -H "Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty" -H "Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors" -H "Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site"`
The pre-flight ones I mean.
Can you try dumping the headers with curl?

Can you share a screenshot?
That is a bug in the cors config, but I suspect you have a different issue.
maybe my Origin has been rate limited how can I know this?
with mainnet though
Did you find a solution? Same issue here
Hi everybody,
I have added our token metadata to tokenslist, and it has been auto-merged! so I'm not here to ask for someone to merge it lol
I'm just wondering after the merge when does it start working and showing up on wallets like Phantom with Metadata? 
The merge was more than 24hrs ago
I see, thanks. Is there anything we could do to reduce the program size? e.g. maybe there's a release mode of some kind?
I think it is a good solution too. (before you swapping token at raydium, you also need to setup your two sides token account by two tx)
because user's can't send more than one token at once

will I need to get them todo two instruction transactions

i.e. two buttons to launch phantom transaction

button 1: load receipt token
button 2. load charm token

and when the user completes I run my custom program to complete by four steps
AFAIK you want to do these 4 steps in one tx so I think you can write a program to do it. and you program just do the 4 steps for user.
I find this confusing. If the owning program (in my case the metadata program) declares the instruction, shouldn't that instruction be responsible for validating permissions? Because it's an instruction in the owning program I would have thought that would be enough to allow the account to be written.
you can use `solana rent <bytes-size-here>` to estimate how many sol you need when you deploy your program.
and check ` --max-len <max_len` in `solana program deploy --help`
could you please explain what you mean by "so maybe you wrap your steps in your program I think."
you can take a look at https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/master/src/program-rust/tests/lib.rs#L14 for a full test for your program
or just write some unit test for your function https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/instruction.rs#L1323

if you want to use something like console log when program executing, you can use `msg!` to print message.
Hi, I created a pool FVKoxc6Tfj7MND54eXzYUw6BW6mkj9t1uYcPjyCMHnTk (see here: https://dex.solhamster.space/#/pools/FVKoxc6Tfj7MND54eXzYUw6BW6mkj9t1uYcPjyCMHnTk ), how to set it up and where can I do it?
I think you can update metadata. there is the instruction. https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/rust/token-metadata/program/src/instruction.rs#L62
and I don't think you can force user to send a receipt token and a charm token at the same time because spl-token program allow them to transfer individually.
so maybe you wrap your steps in your program I think.
Another question. I'm trying to deploy the original token swap contract to devnet and testnet. Getting this message when I have 1 sol balance on my account: `Error: Account FCLyuPyqyvQZgnXGM9dnPV2GjUnPJW1xAEymMs4ChNtH has insufficient funds for spend (1.84939032 SOL) + fee (0.001335 SOL)`. Is this a normal price?
tell me, how is it possible to debug the program? For example, I want to understand what comes in this function parameter, what this function gives, what is in this array during program execution. Like console.log() in run time JavaScript
..
Alternatively, maybe I can have a receipt token, it would work in a similar way

1. user sends receipt token and a charm token
2. burn charm token
3. off-chain program listens for this and updates the receipt metadata (that may exist either on-chain or off-chain)
4.  return recieipt
I've thought about this a bit more, and I think the receipt could be the item itself, let me try to explain....

let's say for example I create a virtual pandora bracelet (you know the ones that comes with the charms)

I have the bracelet itself (as a token) 

and I have charm tokens

I want to send the bracelet and a "spoon" charm token to a solana program and if the input is valid...

1. update the bracelet metadata (to say that the "spoon" charm has been added)
2. burn the charm token
3. return bracelet token 

Is it possible to update the metadata of a token inside a Solana smart program?
Hello! does the nft with metaplex metadata work in all marketplace?
I think you can also use `1nc1nerator11111111111111111111111111111111`.
Hey Solana devs,

My company has been building a framework for some of the largest insurance companies in the world focusing on data integration and migration and being low-code for the past 20 years.

First of all AMA. Second, I‚Äôm considering deploying this framework Open Source on the Solana eco-system somewhere. I know Anchor is a commonly used framework. Where are you guys missing functionality and ease of use with regards to data integration and migration (API‚Äôs)? Or with matters like data quality or transformation or even testing?
not sure I understand. would you give more detail about `receipts` and what do you want to do with it.
check `solana program deploy --help`
you can specify program id to do updating.
Is it normal for the program ID to not change even after the program has been modified? In this scenario, how to reploy the code?
Anybody came across someone using receipts in Solana?

Have a use case where I need to give the user a receipt and would like to include certain metadata on the receipt. Is this possible?
How to mimic black hole address `0x0` on Solana? I tried `Pubkey::new(&[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]);` but it gave address `11111111111111111111111111111111` (system program ID) instead
Oh okay, thanks.
oh ok thanks <@814228493302497301>

Does the @solana/wallet-adapter work for progressive web apps on mobile devices? When I try examples (e.g. https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/example/) it seems to just open the link to the various wallet home pages (as <@216328510870913034>  mentioned above). I'm trying to get this wallet adapter lib to work in a mobile VueJS PWA. Anyone know if that should work and can point me to any examples or give advice? To be in clear, I have the mobile wallets installed on my Android when I try to use it, e.g. slope, but only the torus wallet example worked for me.
Do u have the wallet extensions installed in ur browser, otherwise it will open a link to the wallets homepage when u click
So what does the walletmultibutton show
Doesn't give the publicKey either in the console or the body.
Doesn't look like it. This time I created a new instance with create-react-app. Then installed the wallet-adapter libraries. Then just modified the App.js exactly as per given in the github.

can someone help me get the nft tokens tha that a public key has with solanaweb3.js?
i mean its something ur doing... lol
People who created solana UIs, some help here please..
I tried this.. Doesn't seem to work.. Any alternatives that I can make use of?
Have been stuck on this like for 5 hours now.. I will try downgrading and see.
if I create an account  on phantom wallet and I don't deposit and sol tokens it it , will it be purged after the next epoch when rent is checked? if so does that mean the account is deleted ?
doea anyone know if solana provides a function to get the price in fiat currency?
could be u a bug in the lib, try downgrading
i dont see a bug, but try cross checking with my repo here https://github.com/maxwellfortney/next-candy-machine
Someone help please.. Stuck on this for hours now..

That's a spl token transfer, so like the usual transfer.
Word. I got everything working as well. Was more curious on something more direct if I was missing it.
solana install worked perfectly on m1 for me, i think the only thing that needs extra setup is setting up a validator
Hey, been down the rabbit hole for Mac M1? Is there any recommendations to get spun up without having to go down the Rosetta terminal route ?
what is the jscode to transfer an NFT from one wallet to another
how to get recent blockhash in python?
how can i download curl?
Got it, thanks
tried looking for one earlier, doesn't seem there's any standard on solana. however 6 and 9 are common. <@888178749533720586>
Thank you. Is there a generic standard?
There seems to be a bug in the public RPC CORS config, where should I report it?
```text
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://api.devnet.solana.com/' from origin 'http://[::1]:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header contains the invalid value 'http://[:'.
```
absolutely.
Yes, that is correct.
It is the number of decimal points the token has.
Is this correct?
Does it determine how many places after the decimal point you can own?
Like 0 decimal means you can only own 1,2,3 and 10 decimal means you can own 1.0000000001 ?
Hello! What does "decimals" mean when referring to tokens?
Is there a way to run solana-test-validator on windows? I keep getting, "tar stderr: tar: Can't launch external program: bzip2"

Yo guys. I‚Äôm super new to solana. I have a question that is probably easily explained. If I have a bep20 token that I want to also be available on solana network‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the easiest way to accomplish that?
Ok - it's starting to make more sense now - ta for the link.. I was reading the implemented proposal docs which are a bit tricky to understand in places.
32 blocks? Isn't that like 12ish seconds?
Example of using nonce account: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-reference#nonceaccount
Transactions can't be older than 32 blocks right now
You can use a nonce account in order to achieve transactions
Oh... I've just discovered that "recent" blockhash in transactions need to be less than about 2-mins old? This could make it quite tricky to get a transaction to my air-gapped machine and back to the network.
Yeah i want to know how people find compiling on M1 w rosetta
(I wonder how long an M1 takes ü§î )
How long does cargo take to build all the crates on a raspberry pi? It's been at it for over 4 hours now. I'm guessing there's no pre-built ones for r-pi, which is why it appears to be building the entirety of all the dependencies ever
are IDL‚Äôs public like ABI‚Äôs in ETH
i see the error is SSL certificate, add -k to command to bypass SSL check `sh -c "$(curl -ksSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.8.2/install)"`
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getAccountInfo
thats.. great but you need to provide more information. if you want people to debug your code you need to show it
Hey! When Im trying to use the Solanas web3 --> connection.getAccountInfo(pubkey) it throws me this error:  UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: publicKey.toBase58 is not a function
<@489206164270350337> please go through this again. I'm already confused. Just guide me through, please üôè
Hi all,

Was wondering if there is some place i can get sample data of the solana ledger, i.e how it's processed when running a validator.

is the output of using getBlock the "same format"?
How should I handle this line?
depending on exactly how you created the keypair the first time... you may need to use `ASK` instead of the `prompt` bit, and if you used a custom seed phrase then you'll need `--skip-seed-phrase-validation` too.
Use `solana-keygen recover` - but you'll probably need some extra bits like `prompt://?key=0/0` and `-o mykeyfile.json`
how do I go from recovery phrase to keypair file?
then in this case, the rewards listed from https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getblock must be sum of all delegated validators for each account. please correct me if i am wrong? hmmm is there any way to learn rewards earned by validator?
https://docs.solana.com/cli/delegate-stake#split-stake
You can do something like split staking to delegate to multiple validators
thanks for your reply. it seems i can not get response from getProgramAccounts for that delegator by this json body 
`  
{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"getProgramAccounts", "params":["7d9TBdQKjWAjtNfQvQBwZT5hZy3BGU2R3R9XP4CbNLai"]}
`

But i have found another thing : 
1. getting "voter" from this response:
`{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getAccountInfo",
    "params": [
      "Bfg9sMdvtmjEsaGcgt6X6X7TsnY4tXDYn5DVhTswiQ99",
      {
        "encoding": "jsonParsed"
      }
    ]
  }
`
2. and then matching it with the response of https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getvoteaccounts , i can find the validator. what do you think?

And could please tell me if that is possible for an account to delegate more than one program? the answer should be no, right?
Owner vs authority are different concepts
Typically the authorized. You can grant authority though
And that would typically be the owner and who else?
Those with authority to update the account can. Anyone can read
it seems that anyone can read account data by calling accountinfo
is it automatically ensured that only the owner of an account can manipulate its data? who can read it?
ok thank you
nice, thanks
`Requests can be sent in batches by sending an array of JSON-RPC request objects as the data for a single POST.`
It's a small but powerful footnote here https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#request-formatting
Dynamic account sizing is not available today. It is pulled into master and will be available one day, but the release is not ready just yet
how can i do that? cant seem to find it in the docs
https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/1903/files#diff-827c1376911cec5eb14653be1a34f430bcfb675b355c19c23c352633d625da50L19549
is there a way to change the amount of data an account holds or do I have to do that at the time of account creation?
Everything seems fine to me. Can you show me where the deletion occurred?
So if you followed everything, you'll see that you're not getting merged because you have a deletion in your PR. Remediate and it should be auto pulled.
Looks like you can see the validator staked to here https://solscan.io/account/Bfg9sMdvtmjEsaGcgt6X6X7TsnY4tXDYn5DVhTswiQ99
You can verify with getting the stake info on their stake account, or getProgramAccounts pointing to the stake program filter with the validator
yes
How? Or you mean PR link?
Link it?
Adding a token with Token name and logo. Already pulled a request but has been pending
sorry for many questions. I am confused. For this account https://explorer.solana.com/address/Bfg9sMdvtmjEsaGcgt6X6X7TsnY4tXDYn5DVhTswiQ99/rewards i can see rewards are the same from RPC endpoint. Where do you show from which validator that reward is taken? Is it possible for an account to delegate more than one validator?
Lots of people working. What exactly are you asking about?
Why are there so many pull requests pending on Solana lab?

I'm working on a serious project and my pull requests has been pending for long.

Any Admin or Dev to talk to?
You can batch the transactions into a single call
yep but wont i hit rate limit quite fast since each transaction would require an additional call?
Serum cranks out something like 10gb of data a minute, so I believe what you're trying to do should definitely be feasible
I would recommend getting your own rpc infra if you haven't already
RPCs have different limitations. I heard from some other developers they ran into issues when the json was larger than ~ 50KB. You can test and see what best fits your solution
What would be the ideal number in batch?
I suspect you should still be able to fit more than one settlement invocation transaction batched together though
Sounds like you may have to do something clever with a crank or something, cranking out the settlements as it happens
Oh boy
Our test cases have 10K different addresses to settle
We don‚Äôt know without looking into the account. Account decides who will be the winners and send the winning amount correctly. As I mentioned we tried to group 5 settlements into one transaction and it got compute units errors sometimes
great
Yeah thanks - looks like it... https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/20570 - I'd try to contribute back an installer but I haven't really got much of a clue how at this point üòÑ
So you don't know who to pay without querying the account? Are there more than 1 person to pay? You could still batch transactions if there are multiple
Or ODT you see my point :)
Likely going to have to do it from source. You could always try though
I would check the Metaplex discord https://discord.gg/metaplex
It's like a safety check if you want people to exist first
Yes, that should be fine. That seems to be how Phantom does it today, as well as it is required in `1.8.2` if the recipient doesn't currently exist
Yes I understand but It could have been cool to mint TXT or DOCX NFT üôÇ
Hello everyone, I have a question about the `properties.category` of the JSON Structure Standard Metada. The supported categories are image, video, audio, vr and html. But my asset is a document (pdf or word). What do you advise to choose ?
Does anyone happen to know if solana will install on a raspberry pi ootb, or if I'll need to build from source?
Thanks <@489206164270350337> for the answer. But I think our issue is we settle directly in the account. Escrow balance, payee addresses are stored in the account. Think our app is like a game, when it‚Äôs time for settlement we will check the game status and settle transactions on chain
Recipient does in fact have 0 SOL. Phantom seems not to care when i do it manually
<@!489206164270350337> new question:
I am getting an error sending the token because `recipient address is not funded`, even though i am using `--fund-recipient` and paying 0.002 SOL as discussed above. Is there a danger to using `--allow-unfunded-recipient`?
Some of the best evolutions of code come from bugs
I do have bugs from time to time though
I am hired üëç
I think <@!489206164270350337> is an AI Robot with an SLA of 2 seconds to answer questions. Who wrote THAT code, he's hired!
You could batch the transactions sending before sending to the rpc
Seems right to me. You can cross check with chaincrunch and solana.fm
Hello dev fellows, our team is working on a settlement app, the usual test case requires settlement to a few thousands addresses. We tried to group 5 payee destinations in one single transaction and we get compute unit errors quite often. However, when we change to one address per transaction it will run smoothly. But with 10000 payees, our program will take like 2 hours to complete. Anyone here have a better approach on this pls help
thanks for your reply, i filtered by  ` {"jsonrpc": "2.0","id":1,"method":"getBlock","params":[104976000, {"encoding": "json","transactionDetails":"none","rewards":true}]}` and get the staking rewards response. Example:

` 
               {
                "commission": 10,
                "lamports": 253036004,
                "postBalance": 540480532028,
                "pubkey": "Bfg9sMdvtmjEsaGcgt6X6X7TsnY4tXDYn5DVhTswiQ99",
                "rewardType": "Staking"
            },
`
253036004 is the reward right? but this reward earned by delegating which validator? can you show me a way to figure it out?
I had no problems when doing it from a MacOS, but trying it on my Ubuntu VM gave me the linking with cc failed error, making me think I am missing a Ubuntu specific dependency not listed in the instructions. Trying the Build from Source from here https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools currently. Thanks for the reply!
Staking rewards are distributed the slot after a new epoch has started
You should be able to run all those in the readme. You could try these as well(but I think they'll be about the same) https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools
I am actually looking for getting staking rewards for each delegator. I just figured out https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getblock this can return staking rewards. Can you tell me a slot as an example so i can see staking rewards response?
awesome ty
Hello, I am attempting to build from source (curiosity reasons) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, but I am running into an error (linking with 'cc' failed: exit status: 254) when running the cargo build command. I am following the README: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/README.md. Should I be following the Build From Source instructions at https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools instead?
You can use `closeAccount` within the token lib to do so https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/81c90f5c73732536c4b27f8139f4299bed06e93a/token/js/client/token.js#L1109
devnet: https://api.devnet.solana.com
testnet: https://api.testnet.solana.com
mainet-beta: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
awesome, how?
The endpoints for each are listed here https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints
Yes, you can close the accounts and recapture the rent
hm i see. thanks a bunch. but when i get rid of the nft, i still have this account sitting around with the 0.002 SOL in it, which is useless to me. can i recapture that SOL?
Hey guys, how can I do some API calls to the Solana devnet or mainet? I have readed the RPC API documentation but I dont now with what instance I can connect to the devnet
Try `getSignaturesForAddress` https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress and `getTransaction` https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
To figure out delegators, you have to use `getProgramAccounts` pointing to the stake program and using the appropriate filter
Check out the manual transaction construction in this example https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-reference#example-usage-1
Every account must have space allocated that they own in order to receive the NFT. You can't have the same space authorized by many(well, or could, but then anyone could sell your NFT at will)
So I did some digging as I've never run into this exact problem before. Looks like https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/778656605453156376/833244193152958484 has this issue, and it was because the caller program didn't have access. However, they were able to achieve with multiple accounts
or does an api exist for that? solana explorer and solscan arent informative enough
is there a way to get all the transactions from an address, with information to which address the tx was sent to?
Actually just checked and both invoking and invoked accounts are writable.
Hey üëã I have a couple of questions:

1. I am able to list all validator from this https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getblockproduction   is there an endpoint to list all delegators of a validator?

2. I guess this https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getinflationreward provides staking rewards of delegators, right? If so, this returns only reward without validator info. How do we decide how much reward from which validator for a specific height? Or a delegator can only delegate to only one validator?

3. is there a way to get epoch info at a specific slot?
How can I add a signer to sendAndConfirmTransaction without having the keypair (e.g. I want the person connecting their 3rd party wallet to sign the transaction). Almost all examples I see either use a new keypair or call the payer/signer from a json file
i understand that -- however, it seems like this would have to happen *once* (when the nft is first minted). and from then on the account is simply mutated. i dont see why a *new* account would be created for an NFT that already has an account associated with it, just because i transfer ownership
Only the Metadata account is writable. I assumed that was all that's necessary because it's the only data that's changing.
Privileges are extended through CPI, and should be able to write each as long as they're sent as writable
Are you calling with both accounts writable?
Going through the runtime source it looks like there may be a special check for CPIs. Is that what I'm running into? Does the CPI caller need write permissions as well?
https://discord.gg/xXA4TGpA
I am not sure on how the python sdk works. There's an anchor-py channel in the anchor discord with the sdk folks in it. Please check them out there
Check out https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/rent
Because accounts take up storage space, which you have to pay 'rent' for. If you don't pay the rent, the account will be dealloc'd at the end of an epoch
if not, when is it required
or is that not the case
why is opening the account required every time the token gets sent to somebody new?
You can use the adapter's `signMessage` function. Please note: not all wallets support this today
The 0.002xxx is considered rent for opening the account. That specific amount is likely what is required to be rent exampt
trying to send a tx with the python solana api.
I created the tx, assigned to a blockhash, signed but when I try to send the tx to the client (client.send_transaction) I get the error:
solana.rpc.core.RPCException: {'code': -32602, 'message': 'invalid transaction: index out of bounds'}
someone can help?
add 2 or more 0s when you do the BN and then convert manually on the client. BN.js doesnt support decimals
nm, I found it!
i get all tokens address and call solana-labs/token-list to get their name, and I would like to show their price
hey guys, what is the best way to get the token list price? I try to use the coingecko api, but the not sure the proper id
Couldn't agree anymore. I'm going to be a philosopher, wondering if I'm human...


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

anyone know how common is `connection.onLogs` to skip a transaction? sometimes I notice it skips a few, so I'm considering revert back to keep using `getSignaturesFromAddress2` each second or less üò¶ more resource intensive I guess, but so be it
thanks :)))
<@!903369685570035822> 
`solana-keygen pubkey --help`
with the CLI i mean
is there a way to get the public key of a .json private key without having a test validator running?
For cost of execution units, yes, depends on the needs of your program and the constraints like this
hey guys, how can i check wether an account holds a particular token or not from my custom contract?
Thank you! Now it works pretty good with the solana cli version 1.8.2 üôè
Is there a hardhat alternative for solang?
solana-cli 1.9.0 (src:devbuild; feat:2420900513)
indeed, I installed the 1.90
is there anyways I can pull the history of transactions given an address? The best I can find with the current api is pulling history of signatures and pull confirmed transaction from each signature one by one.
Yet to try. Just wanted to get the general idea around doing floating math inside the contract. The general opinion is to avoid doing that.
not sure what version you used. maybe try to reinstall via
 `sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.8.2/install)"`
Result was the same: accountnotfound
It seems like the CLI can‚Äôt see the devnet at all. I also tried to airdrop some sol to an address created with phantom on the devnet. So, I‚Äôm pretty sure it exists on the devnet
Built and installed from the source code
The latest one downloaded and installed this morning
Ok thanks for the info üò≠
sorry for the misleading. seems you can't set it back if you have already leave a null value in the auth. üò¢
My apology for the stupid question, but is there a website that allows to query solana transactions? With query I mean more than just looking at the history of a particular adress, I want to query for example all the interactions from wallet X with program addres Y within a time range. From what I can see so far, I cannot do this on solscan/solana explorer?
and we also get : RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x10 [5 log messages]
already tried it said Current freeze authority: disabled
for js sdk example: https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/advanced/token/set-authority.html
for command line tool `spl-token authorize --help`
BTW what is your solana's cli version
How to do it later ? Because we are trying to freeze some account but we cannot because it said "current freeze authority: disabled‚Äù and never disable it. It wasnt enable by default

and I'm pretty sure to be on the devnet
and if I do: 

solana account XXXXXX  (where XXXX is the new generated address)

it says: 

Error: AccountNotFound: pubkey=XXXXX
it continues to say 

Error: RPC response error -32601: Method not found
but then when I did 

solana airdrop 1
did it, then I did a

solana keygen new --force

and I got a new address
you have to parse tx history by yourself to recovery it.
no. when you init your mint. you can also specific you freeze auth.
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L52
but don't worry. you can also set it later.
~~for js sdk example: https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/advanced/token/set-authority.html
for command line tool `spl-token authorize --help`~~
-----------
seems not. you can't set it back.
use `solana config set -ud` to set your default network to devnet
and try to just airdrop for 1 SOL via
Basically, see the 'builtins' for `f32`, `f64` or integers
what have you tried?
Is there any good way to deal with exponents and logarithms in Solana?
Is mining this coin legal and or profitable? I don‚Äôt see anything on the website about mining and I‚Äôm only starting to get into crypto so I‚Äôm not sure how anything works lol
How can you get the history of previous holders for a specific token like you see for nfts on solscan?
DM if so ‚ù§Ô∏è
payment will be provided ofcourse
would appreciate if anyone is able to do this or know someone that i can be referred to
Hey, need someone able to create discord sales bot and also input a sort of counter into a discord left panel showing a community wallet balance
Hey freeze authority is disable by default when you create a token?
a simple no would have sufficed -.-
anyway, be aware that there is a scamming bot that DMs new users as soon as they write here
any idea on this?
Solana core I mean
hello, when we have
  "Current freeze authority: disabled"
is not possible to set again an freeze authority right?
any idea?

the result is always this:
and then a: 

solana airdrop 5
solana keygen new --force
made a 

solana config set --url devnet
so, I decided to try to work on the devnet
however, when I try to build and deploy any example with the anchor framework, I run into problem, like: "you are trying to interact with a program that does not exist"
but now it seems to work, since I can run a solana test validator
and struggled a lot to install everything on it
I've got a Mac M1
I'm trying to develop a first full-stack example on solana
hi everyone
Yes that‚Äôs what I was scared about. I can‚Äôt figure out a way to check the direct caller address. For example, I want B to be able to verify that it‚Äôs being firectly called by A. I thought about invoke_signed to do that but according to your response it won‚Äôt work. If A call C then C call B, verifying signers won‚Äôt be enough
Example? What folder of repo?
the result of createAccountWithSeed is generated by `sha256([base, seed, program_id])`
if you can reverse it, you got the base pubkey.
if you mean A use `invoke_signed` to call B, then B use `invoke` to pass PDA to next call.
In the situation is yes. It will be passed to the next call.
maybe try this https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/advanced/metaplex/get-tokenmeta.html
are there any good nft apis that I can use to get data about nfts on sol
starting to code with solana and blockchain stuff
If a program make a signed a transction using a PDA and invoke_signed, with the callee program be able to make invoke call and pass my PDA as signer too ?
Hello everyone, does anyone know if there is a way of getting the base address used to call the createAccountWithSeed? Basically, I have the generated account, the seed and the program account and would like to find the address used previously to create that account with the same program public key and seed. I am wondering if it is only a 1 way mapping or I could somehow map back from the generated account to the base account
i have around 2k holder on ETh and i want to drop them the NFT on Solana
no i dont know
Yes, that is the price for the config account on-chain.
If you know the seed phrase then you know their private key.
Wait a minute.
Yeah i want to go from ETH wallet address -> to Solana wallet address
As long as you can go from ETH wallet -> seed phrase you can go from seed phrase -> sol wallet.
Hello Devs, is there anyway to determine the address of solana wallet from an ethereum wallet address
For example:
Is it possible to get the solana address `X` of eth wallet `0x0165F27bd6953557bBE3E8B8BC0cAEC78E1cc16C` so user can use same seed phrase of the eth address and get the `X` address.
I have an NFT collection on ETH and want to migrate it to Solana and airdrop the current holder (`2k` holders) without going with the struggle of collecting their Solana addresses.
Thanks!!
<@!397873916741156875> I run into an error when trying to build the binaries. I tried sending you a DM but can't
what is the difference of signer and authority in solana? in most of the situation, i think they are the same, is that right? thanks.
Thank you very much <@!235463800239816705> üòÅ
This should not cost that much, I recommend you try uploading to AR yourself and then provide that url to the create-candy-machine metadata. Also for metaplex questions, try their discord!
Hello guys, I try to upload a 10k nft collection, but metaplex want me to have 16 SOL in my wallet, is that a normal price ?
Hi, does anyone know if there is a way of getting the base address used to call the createAccountWithSeed? Basically, I have the generated account, the seed and the program account and would like to find the address used previously to create that account with the same program public key and seed
Ok it worked damn I need more sleep. Thanks a lot
thanks
Ok
I guess it is a protection which Phantom do for you. You can write some code via any sdk and send your sol to PDA again. It should work.
Phantom doesn't let me send so weird
Really? Why when I try to send sol it says the adress is invalid <a:aPES_Think:746135856783425680>
yes. it can have sol.
Hello, can PDA account have a sol balance?
I'm trying to understand the source code of solana, any useful materials aside from the official docs?
thank you man... you're help always seems to make things easier for me to do.......
https://spl.solana.com/token#finding-all-token-accounts-for-a-specific-mint
here is the idea. just use getProgramAccount to get it.
is there any sort of function in the solana web 3 that can help me get the token account address from a mint account address?
i got that bro checked up on their github and found my answer for decoding the data returned by that method.....
you can try this.

this is the data that is returned by the getAccountInfo method.
and is the data that is at the top the serialized struct for an account struct layout?
thank you got that i think i was trying to check the token address that was on the mainnet but my connection was set to devnet...
I guess you try to fetch some accounts which parsers can't be found so it return you base64.
AFAIK it words for build-in account (token, stake, vote ...)
if i do connection.getAccountInfo(Token Address) why does it return me null value
=> you will get null value if the account haven't init. just check your network or address again.
how can i get the info about a mint(Token itself) account? if this makes sense
=> use getAccountInfo and parse its data then you will get the mint info.
sorry i couldn't understand what you meant?
Hey guys -- Im calling `getParsedProgramAccounts` but for some reason the data is still returned as base64.... any idea why that might be happening?
you will get null value if the account haven't init.
`getAccountInfo` is the right path for you to get mint account info
I figured out my question btw. It looks like a version of cargo that wasn't controlled by rustup was screwing things up
if i do connection.getAccountInfo(Token Address) why does it return me null value???
how can i get the info about a mint(Token itself) account? if this makes sense
is there any smart contract written in C++ on solana. need an example to learn from
I think I had to tweak the rust verison with rustup... now 'cargo +bpf build' works but it keeps giving me warnings about the 'bash: warning: shell level (1000) too high' I'll keep working on it
I tried running it from the cargo that is in the solana project directory but it doesn't work either and I'm not familiar enough with rust projects to know what to do
'cargo +bpf build' seems to give the error. I'm on ubuntu
when trying to compile a project
has anyone had issues with 'error: no such subcommand: `+bpf`'?
for an spl token , is the  treasury the same as the mint address , or a different account is created to store that. or is the minted tokens stored on the program account?
i am using borsh serialization how can i decode that
I dont see info on how to do anything related to logs in those docs
is this in the javascript web3.js lib?
youll have to know how to decode the data portion, potentially based on the data inside the account, or u can try the getParsed version.
your best bet right now is probably log events with onlog and filter,  parse what u need
const accountInfo = await connection.getAccountInfo("my data public key here");
console.log(accountInfo.data.toString())

This give me  this type of output. Anyone please help

Is there a way to recieve all incoming pending transactions via events similarly to ethereum web3.js?
didn‚Äôt take time
It was automatically merged
Or is it a 1 way encryption? I have the AccountPubKey, Seed and ProgramPubKey.
I have a quick question. I am using createAccountWithSeed, is there a way to find the base account later on?
Oh idk. How long did it take to get merged?
but what I'm essentially getting at is how would you distribute code across programs to optimize for speed?
Sorry if the question is a bit vague
I have a general question about developing programs for Solana. If someone is trying to optimize for speed, is there some general guidance on how to balance size of your program. For instance, to be as fast as possible, would it be recommended to have programs that each only consist of one function and then have entrypoint references to other programs to do other atomic tasks?
after it got merged? <@!888178749533720586>
I think it can take like 2 weeks
I also got my metadata merged but still not showing in Phantom
Does anyone know where the data from this https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list actually shows up? Will this show in solana explorer?
Hello, I'm very much new to the whole Solana web3. I want to create - to put it shortly - a frontend button, that will connect a wallet for the app to use, but I have quite a trouble trying to find the best source to learn how to do this.

I would mean the world to me if somebody could point me in the right direction.

Ok, so then the keypair you are sending in is not valid
Hey guys regarding cross program invocations, is there a way to verify that the caller is a specific program ?
I don't know what a remote signer / hsm is, does that mean a hardware wallet? I'm trying to build an airgapped solution, slightly different.
Is anyone aware of a remote signer / hsm that supports Solana clients?
Are there are examples or resources on how to use walletconnect v2 with Solana? I'm seeing some conflicting references online... Some say it might work and others say it doesn't work yet.
There's probably a profiling library you can use, or just get the current time in nanoseconds before and after. Technically you'd be getting the total time from sending to receiving the confirmation id. I'm not sure how much use it is though as won't it always be a nunber between 1x and 2x the slot time?
is there a way in python to get the time beetween the send request and the tx confirmed?
how does one get the Owner of an address with solana rpc api?

That's one reason for sure
is it not?
is it coz getrandom is not supported on bpf?
Hey guys, not sure if this is the place to post this, but I'm trying to run `anchor test` to test my solana program written in rust. And I've included the `rand` library in my `cargo` and for some reason I get the following error.
memory management is a bitch in C
in my opinion anyway
The primary paradigm shift between Rust and C is the memory management
so overall consensus would be to learn rust <@!903369685570035822>
any docs on this are welcome too
You can write Programs in "C" as both it and Rust go through LLVM and the LLVM-IR is then emitted into BPF. However; the bulk of open source programs you can use as examples are primarily in Rust.
i came from a java background so i was tempted to just do C, but, rust is a beautiful language and i would highly recommend to learn it. Plus you will get a lot more language support and you can use the Anchor framework
new to solana dev here. I have a strong background in C but everywhere I look I see things in rust. Is it worth it to learn rust and the develop in that or should I stick to C

sorry i'm a noob. can you explain the whole end to end process on taking newly minted spl tokens and getting them listed and then providing an ability for holders of that token to stake them? how does one go about that? For example $AURY just provided staking for their token. providing step by step tutorials on this would really help
How ?
That's all permissionless
Raydium or Serum so people with Phantom wallets can buy them
Listed on what?
So that, given a public key, you can always get back to the account key
What you can do is derive the account keys
Ah
That's the page im reading
This may help https://solana.wiki/docs/solidity-guide/accounts/
Humm, let me try a more simple way to explain.
Let's take the hello-world example. It does create an account on the client side, then send it to the SC that store data in it.
Now, let's say it's a Dapp, and an infinite number of people can call this SC. It will do the same process, but the pubkey of the account that is created to store the data is lost after i close the navigator.
And to update my integer, i need to send the pubkey of the account that store the data to the hello-world SC right ?
I hope it's clear enough
So how do i not loose the pubkeys that store data ?
Require online account, online nonce account + offline versions
Note the highlighted lines would be done offline
Hey, check this out https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/offline-nonce-account/offlineNonceAccount.js#L93-L99
With this, you can have a completely offline account + offline nonce account. I think if you add the ability to do sign only as well on the CLI, you can achieve this.
Hi, i'm new to developing on solana. My cofounder and I in the process of trying to launch own own SPL token.

I'm not sure whether I understand your example, but looking at the documentation for program-derived addresses might be a good start. https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses
Hi,
I'm starting with solana dev, i was reading about accounts storage, that like in EVM you have a mapped key/pair, but in solana you have to create a new account for each "key/pair" if you want to store dynamic data.
My question is, how/where do you store the pubkey of the account freshly created where you store data.
Like for example:
I want to create a SC that store an int for any wallet calling the SC.
The SC create a new account (or should it be done from the client like in the hello-world example ?)
We store the int, good.
But now if later i want to update this int. How do i get back my pubkey of the account where my int is stored. So i can pass it through my "process_instruction" ?
Thank you
Anyone know how long solana.explorer/solscan takes to update a token after a successful PR?

I have to run right now, but I'll get back to you with your question
What errors are you seeing?
Ok - great - how to send it? The outdated docs for `transfer` (`pay`) say that you use the same command again `solana transfer etc.` but add the `--blockhash` and `--signer` in order to send it - this is the bit that fails (even when recent blockhash is valid)
That may clear some things up
Let me work a better example where authorized and fromPubKey are different
So they can both sign offline and then take the rawtransaction signature to an online computer and send it
thanks
The payer can't be online - the payer's keys are offline on purpose.
If I am understanding you correctly, the above example could have the nonceAccount as the offline, and the payer as the online account. Both have to sign it.
What's your exact error?
Sender account is the one who signed it offline. No account is the online one trying to submit it to an RPC.
There's also genesysgo and triton
Try serum discord https://discord.gg/NtQSyfn4
I'm confused, who is the sender account?

How to resolve unable to start test validator error?? I am trying to run program but error is not goin away.
This sounds very broken - or am I missing something?
So the transaction buffer needs to be signed by the same (sender) account, when all it's doing is submitting a previously-signed transaction request?
I believe you are correct, yes
I don't believe you can add recentBlockhash later to the transaction after the signatures
You have to sign the transaction buffer with all private accounts, which requires the recentBlockhash in it beforehand
This is a manual transaction creation example in web3: 
```
const transaction = new web3.Transaction({
    feePayer: account.publicKey,
    recentBlockhash: await connection.getRecentBlockhash()
  }).add(
    web3.SystemProgram.createNonceAccount({
      fromPubkey: account.publicKey,
      noncePubkey: nonceAccount.publicKey,
      authorizedPubkey: account.publicKey,
      lamports: minimumAmount,
    }),
  );

  // Need recentBlockhash before creating the transaction buffer to sign
  let transactionBuffer = transaction.serializeMessage();
  let signature = nacl.sign.detached(transactionBuffer, nonceAccount.secretKey);
  let payerSignature = nacl.sign.detached(transactionBuffer, account.secretKey);

  transaction.addSignature(nonceAccount.publicKey, signature);
  transaction.addSignature(account.publicKey, payerSignature);

  let rawTransaction = transaction.serialize();

  await web3.sendAndConfirmRawTransaction(connection, rawTransaction);```
Ahh I didn't realise the transaction buffer needs to be signed too - is that why `transfer` insists on using a local `id` (and then fails when it's not the same as the actual signer)?
I think what you're saying makes sense. I was just trying to do what you're saying with web3, and the problem is that you have to sign the transaction buffer after you've added the recent blockhash. This makes it quite hard to sign with both the "live account" and "offline nonce account" and send it
(this isn't hugely thought through and I don't fully understand what can/can't be done already - so might not be valid)
I think there could be a better overall approach to nonce accounts too tbh - but that would be quite a change... something like system-owned nonce accounts and you "rent" single-use-tokens (with an expiry), the fees could be paid as part of the transaction that uses the token rather than up-front, and the system could allow short-lived ones to be obtained for free this way, or long-lived to be obtained only when funding upfront.
tbh the recent blockhash method should work, if `transfer` behaved nicely.
Yeah exactly - nonce account needs to be rent-exempt, so you have to fund it... in order to create it that means you need access to a key of a funded account. Therefore those nonce operations need to support offline signing and submission in order for that to work.
Another way would be to fix `transfer` so that it respects the CLI arguments `--from` and/or automatically figures out the sender from the `--signer` rather than trying to use a local id (or failing if there isn't one)
So create the nonce account transaction offline and use the transaction later to sign by another account?
It'd probably need a few other commands to support it too.
Well, `create-nonce-account` could support `--sign-only` so that you can create and fund it from an offline transaction. That would be one way.
How would you propose the flow be?
I want to fix the problem rather than sweeping it under the rug - hope that makes sense.
I could create a hot wallet, beg for some SOL (since all my sol from exchange is already in my cold wallet), or pay in some more via exchange, but it's a broken approach.
Can you fund the nonce account using another that is online?
Yes - I can't fund a nonce account without putting private keys on an online machine.
Are you still getting the recent blockhash instead of using the nonceAccount advance instruction?
Also check this example https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/786929822638407680 with the CLI
I did actually manage to sign offline using a USB stick and a rather crappy bash script to get a recent block-hash... the issue was the CLI `transfer` command doesn't seem to work for submitting offline transactions signed this way - it ignores the `--from` and tries to use a local id from the online machine.
(faucets and begging for SOL seems like a broken system rather than the answer btw)
Yeah - but I can't do that because it's impossible to fund the nonce account from offline - CLI `create-nonce-account` command doesn't support `--signer`
ok cool - many projects seem to suffer an unfortunate (and usually unintentional) rite of passage where you have to bang your head against the wall in frustration for ages to achieve something big and impressive before you'll be taken seriously üòÑ - been feeling a bit like that lately :/
You should create the transaction with the advance nonce instruction, sign, then you can pass to the payer to sign and confirm online
By the way, with regard to offline signing, check out this thread https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/786999703564451870

I think you should deploy your program and make some instructions for user to stake. you can use a PDA and its token account for storing those token which user staked.

Hi Everyone, How to get or create associated account using wallet
Programs (Solana speak for smart contracts) themselves don't have state that can be modified at run-time. However; you create Program owned Accounts and you can pre-allocate up to 10 Mb in size for state. When your program runs you pass it accounts and if the account is program owned it can read/write data to its state. If you pass an account that the program does not own you can still read from that accounts state
Yeah, the signer privilege gets propagated to the next CPI and so on
yup got it to work!
Hey people! I do some experiments with very basic functionality and I have observed some strange things.
if you create seed from mnemonics `let seed = bip39.mnemonicToSeedSync(mnemonic)` it will contain 64-byte array, and I can now generate KeyPair using first 32-bytes: `const keypair = web3.Keypair.fromSeed(seed.slice(0, 32))` now if I inspect keypair I see two attributes: publicKey (32bytes) and secretKey (64bytes) and secret key is concatenation of seed + public key. it's all fine, but I don't understand why `memonicToSeedSync()` returns 64byte array while we need only 32butes? what other 32 bytes used for, and is it used at all?
if wallet A is the mint authority, wallet A should sign tx too.
are pda signatures extended through a CPI? i have a pda signing a CPI, is it possible to extend it to another call?
yes bro that's what i'm trying to figure out.... so when i send the keys to the blockchain should i just send the address of wallet B to the program?
Flow would be like: 
```wallet A mints a token 
creates it's token account, 
mint 1 token into it, 
```and then 
```creates a token account for wallet B and 
transfer it to that account...```
oh. if it involves mint token, it could be.
to more precise, you just need a funder to this tx, so if your fee payer is wallet A it would be good.
but if you have two different accounts , the other one would useless
Hi 

To maintain smart contract state in Solana what is the process?
what i'm trying to do is wallet A will mint a token and then create a token account whose owner will be wallet B and transfer that token to wallet B token account.
how or why?
actually you don't need wallet A in this tx
yes exactly
it could be.
you mean you have FEE_PAYER and wallet A
and they create a token account for wallet B right?
is it possible to create a token account with signer and fee payer for the transaction being wallet A and the owner of that account be a wallet B?
And does anyone have an idea how i could fix it?

Hey guys, I'm writing a kind of 'sale swap' contract where you send an spl token in exchange for something else. I'm wanting the spl-token to be wrapped SOL. From a user's perspective I want them to be sending just SOL however. Does anyone know how to wrap SOL, or if there are some docs on it?
1. https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints#mainnet-beta and the endpoint is hosted by serum, not sure is it follow the same rate limit rule.
2. It should be. if you found there is any mismatchs, just open an issue!
there are some web3js example https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/
I am learning to program on Solana, yesterday I created several wallets as I was trying to mint some sol without success. Today I wanted to start all over, I created a new wallet in spl but have not be able to create Token account. The problem I am having is, it is just loading non stop. Please any ideas? .
Hey, can someone help me with 2 quick questions? 1) what exactly is the rate limit for the json rpc api, I'm connecting to the node https://solana-api.projectserum.com, 2) Does the getMultipleAccounts method always return the account data in the same order that the public keys were entered?
Is there any lib like openzeppelin for building smartcontacts for NFTs for solana
<@842505775318564895> could you please share the resources with for normal minting please.
Yes, you can store arrays, scalars, BTreeMap (instead of HashMap) and so on. Many programs i've seen are using borsh as it is less. costly. Basically you are given a reference to and array of U8 (`&[u8]` or `&mut [u8]`) with length equal to the size you allocated when creating the account.
is there a tutorial to implement sidechain for solana? I googled and don't seems to have any sidechain doc for solana
for now you have to parse tx history by yourself
maybe ask to metaplex team. https://discord.gg/Hzgpe6SZ

When i uploading . Please solution

Hi Team,
is there any sample smart contract to mint token using RUST?
Hello, in the solana web 3 connection class it's constructor takes 2 arguments
1: cluster url
2: commitment, can anyone please tell me what are those values i.e. singlegossip confirmed finalized? what would be the difference between confirmed and finalized?
?
anyway, is there a REAL basic tutorial on how to deploy a basic contract on the devnet and interact with it by means of javascript
hi everyone. I'm still not able to deploy and interact with contracts on devnet
Hello everyone, is there a template for ICO Token offering and Presale for SPL-Tokens? There is the Candy-Machine for NFT's but couldn't find a template for ICO/Presale
okay!
Is there a tutorial on how to setup GRAPE on discord?
and good ideas on how to use it for the community, i saw more servers start to use it so i was wonderin'.
Hi!
What projects already supported by solana fund?
https://solana.com/grants
every address which derived by [seed + program id] is PDA.
ATA is just associated token program's PDA.
AFAIK you have to implement your own token's stake mechanism.
<@!848551904547569664> how do I join the <#439194979856809985>  channel?
is the pda and ata(Associated Token Account) same?  just for different usecase, thanks for reply.
Anyone know how long solana.explorer/solscan takes to update a token after a successful PR?
is there a staking module also available in the SPL library for spl tokens. the staking I see in the docs looks different. I'm refferring to the defi staking for yeilds where users will stake their `xyz` token and get an apy? any hints?
Is there an architecture overview of the solana repo somewhere?
Oh...Thanks a lot for your help
after deploying a nft on the devnet, how do I whitelist people?
I believe the program must panic, because the transaction needs to fail if invoke fails
in a separate terminal
run `solana logs`
I have a question, i saw that the ethereum virtual Machine is compatible with solana via neon labs, so i can create proyects in solidity and implement into solana?
`--from` doesn't work either üòø  - so many bugs üò¶
any ideas on what I'm missing?
hello all, im using anchor to create a simple counter program on localnet, but importing the `msg` macro like so `use anchor_lang::solana_program::{msg};` and using it like `msg!('hello world')` doesn't show in the terminal where I have solana logs running.
My bash script generates a bash script on the USB to execute.. so messy üòÑ
Looks like there's a `--from` - shouldn't be needed, but will try.
Here's the problem: `solana transfer <recipient> <amount> --allow-unfunded-recipient --blockhash <hash> --signer "<sender=signature>"` This command tries to use the default signer, NOT the one specified. If you don't have one (which I don't on my online machine) it fails "No default signer found" but if I create a dummy one just so that id.json exists, then it tries to send from that account. ü§ï üß±
Has anyone actually done offline transactions? it's so broken
AARGH! I finally did it and there's a BUG in the CLI that doesn't let me do it üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢ - this is so frustrating
With `--allow-unfunded-recipient` and offline transaction - does it need to be on both the signing command and the submission command?
Hi Friends. I am new to Rust. I am struggling with how to catch the error generated from 'invoke' or 'invoke_signed'. I understand we put a question mark to escalate the error. But I want to send a custom error. I don't want my program to panic.
I'm trying to get a recent blockhash... would I want the head or tail of `solana block $(solana slot) | grep Recent` for the most-recent?
not program. it should be a PDA.  https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses
and when you need to mint use `invoke_signed` in your program
AFAIK, you need to parse instructions by yourself which returned by `getTransaction`
Can a program be the mint authority for an spl-token?
is there any other method to parse a transaction with the RPC api other than ``getTransaction``?
holy moly `solana block` is spammy - I just want a recent hash!!!
You have to design your program and data-storage architecture such that you only store a small amount and a fixed size of data. If you have user-data then you might need a creative way to keep it fixed-size, or store it off-chain, etc.
Yeah but how are you supposed to calculate the size of a PDA if you do not know how many users will interact with the program... I have been stuck on this for a couple days
i.e. you need to figure out up front how much data storage you will need so that you can size it all correctly.
Yeah - I haven't done it yet but was reading about it, so this might be a little wrong... you need to create a program-derived account, give it a size that it can hold, fund it to pay rent for that data storage, then you can use it by passing it in the `accounts` when making calls on it.
Seems like this is a neccessary use case so I'd be surprised if not. For example in the case of a prize pool, where winners are payed out from the pool. There would need to be an account that 1) stored the pool, and 2) held info on all the users that participated to calculate winners
Does anyone know if there is a way to store various data structures in an account? For example, could I serialize a hashmap of all pubids that have interacted with the contract? I know that all data needs to be calculated before hand, so how does this work if you are building a contract that needs to store information from a variable amount of users?
without mobile. as of now looking for someone with experience only due to extremely tight timeline.
Does it involve mobile? I'm keen to find some work where I can learn blockchain stuff as I go, but still provide value in another area.
Hey guys, looking asap for someone who have an experience building tokenSwapProgram, adding/removing liquidity, etc. 
We're happy to hire part-time / full-time / etc. Please DM or like this message and I'll DM you!  üôå

About us: we're a small team of ex-FAANG folks building something cool in the stealth mode with A-list investors & celebrities involved.
Seems that you need to store the nonce-account keypair on an online machine, and in order to create+fund it, you need to have a funded account's keypair on the same machine. This just seems broken
I also don't understand this: `solana create-nonce-account nonce-keypair.json 1` - where is that 1 coming from? doesn't make sense.
From what I can tell I need to fund the nonce account, but if I could transfer funds into it, in order to fund it, then I wouldn't need it as I'd be able to transfer funds.
I'm trying to start simpler first - and I couldn't understand entirely about the rent and things.
Since you're signing that you want to use the nonce account offline, everything will work once you send the signature over the network
Why not use a nonce account for offline signing? When you execute the transaction, you increment the nonce, which gets a recent blockhash for your transaction
Does anyone know the *actual* meaning of "recent" for a recent blockhash? Like how long do I have?
Am I missing a way to get a recent blockhash in the CLI? Seems like it should be there, but I can't find it
need to automate some more
Ok - I tried my offline signing a few times - never managed to get it done in time... blockhash always had expired... swapping USB sticks is too slow apparently
heyy, does anyone know how to implement the minting button onto any website? cant seem to find much online
hi guys, i have a problem, i'm trying to create a token and i'm requesting the spl-token create-token in cmd (windows) and i'm getting the following answer
error: The system cannot find the specified file. (the errors 2)
ah disregard for the moment - i think rust and homebrew may have been using native M1/arm binaries. going to uninstall everything and reinstall to be sure
any ideas on what might cause this?

Hi does anyone know how im meant to get access to the connected wallet's sol balance ? so far i tried this and failed ```js
const resp = solana.request({
        jsonrpc: "2.0",
        id: 1,
        method: "getBalance",
        params: [response.publicKey.toString()]
      });```
when using ``getSignaturesForAddress`` is it possible to set a limit of transactions that it returns?
Hi, everyone. Does anybody know why with the `name-service` program in the SPL, the `new_owner` account in the `Transfer` instruction is passed as part of the instruction instead of as an element in the accounts array? (code, for reference: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/fca9836a2c8e18fc7e3595287484e9acd60a8f64/name-service/program/src/instruction.rs#L71)
Cool, thanks for the reply.
can anyone help me send an nft though solanaWeb3 in js?
it can take longer with the influx of requests, and may take a few weeks based availability. i believe they are looking to update and streamline this process.

Hi, what‚Äôs the turnaround time on merging of ecosystem PRs please?

This has been open for 4 days now. https://github.com/solana-labs/ecosystem/pull/687 - thanks in advance. üôèüèΩ
Hey, to be sure, Does anyone know when I setup the price with update_candy_machine, which number I‚Äôve to put if I want to sell for 1.5 Solana ?
super confusing
if you think the blockhashes cant be accessed on-chain please just say that instead of linking me to a page that heavily suggests if I pass the pubkey in I can get the data
i am passing the account in
??
sounds accurate. what sysvars are available according to docs, vs ones you need to pass in, may depend on version, but blockhash may not be included
reading the data of this
SysvarRecentB1ockHashes11111111111111111111

says its empty
aside from any sysvars available per the docs data needs to be passed in to the program https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/sysvars
whats the best way to access recent blockhashes on-chain
I installed 1.9.0 from source to fix the test validator for running local tests, so I guess I'll just run both versions depending on where I'm trying to deploy
I ended up installing 1.8.2 to get around this, but 1.8.2 `solana-test-validator` doesn't run on my machine
I can create the RPC requests and submit with curl fine, but when sending RPC with incorrect method name I get the same error code as `solana deploy ...` or `solana airdrop 1`
so I've encountered an issue with solana 1.9.0, I'm running on an M1 macbook. When I try to deploy or request airdrops to devnet, I get the "method not found" RPC response


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

And am using my wallets public key as the value in params
I've set my url for my RPCClient as 'https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com'
I'm attempting to use the solana package for Dart/Flutter. When trying to test to see if I can do a "getBalance" on my Phatom wallet I get a "certificate is not yet valid" back. Any ideas?
I will start with the offline signing docs, get a PR in for that, and then try to get it all building/working to do some more involved things in rust. Trying to learn multiple things atm though, so going quite slowly üôÇ
If you feel more comfortable with rust, the rust sdk can do all the things. You could build a little client and use that on your airgapped machine.
Yeah - I agree... and I will give it a go, but there's a steep learning curve which I'm currently right at the bottom of üôÇ
Understood. I think there are just a lot more users of js/ts. It shouldn't be too hard to add this to the CLI
I find it somewhat disturbing that web3.js seems to be the answer for everything though - I won't be installing node on my secure airgapped machine for sure üòÑ
Not CLI again, but web3.js has a message decoder. Could be possible to create this with Rust as well https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Message.html#from
web3.js does have this under `Message.from()` üëç
Hrm - ok that makes sense. I did wonder why `decode-transaction` command didn't also have a `--signer` option.
The thing that is serialized, encoded, and returned by `--dump-transaction-message` is a Message struct. The thing that `decode-transaction` is expecting when it decodes and deserializes the input is a Transaction struct. The difference is that a Transaction includes an array of Signatures. Here are links to those two structs in code (v1.8):
- https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/784c745efa7a32d39222ef3dc0034b88190d194a/sdk/program/src/message.rs#L190
- https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/784c745efa7a32d39222ef3dc0034b88190d194a/sdk/src/transaction.rs#L131

In order to make `solana decode-transaction` work for the dumped output, you would need to deserialize the message, append an array of signatures matching the length specified in `message.header.num_required_signatures` (they can be dummy signatures, though), and then reserialize/encode.
I'd have to look, but I think the solana-web3.js library has tooling to do this.

Probably we ought to have a `solana decode-message` command, or a general `solana decode` that can handle Transactions and Messages.
no i meant, how can i know the different tokens held by an account(just like the this api call `getTokenAccountsByOwner`) in the program.
The `--dump-transaction-message` outputs this for a simple transfer:
```
Blockhash: CDjnQDDXDf8bKThJ2sELpE8Hdc87xsFJBvgYujTmxdPW
Transaction Message: AQABA/hWrXkxGvebQYkx24N2S6nvJB6TWyqxFd0PCYW30QZCAAEXTbqEZ1lIawgCAy62JptA60xkzkkvk4ynH2/BujcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKaz5oiXujGpcpnq3sWcq5YZOfip6QaXsNEeLWNgLR9BAQICAAEMAgAAAICWmAAAAAAA

```
YEah - specify base64 as mentioned
<@!213083996689661953> I see you're on atm - if you have any time to point out what I'm missing it might save me another 12 hours ü§£ (hoping)
default it tries base58
Did you add the encoding in the `decode-transaction` command?
Ideally this approach could make it much easier to sign any kind of offline actions.
oh nvm
thank you so much! You're the best
Yeah... I successfully did the thing yesterday with `transfer`, but then I found this and wondered if it would be a better approach for any type of transaction - so not having to replicate the transaction commands on the online machine.
Hi, how can i unpack a String bundled with other types, like instruction_data == u64/String/u16. Is there any example somewhere ?
So you're decoding a transaction that is signed?
I found that there's a `decode-transaction` CLI command, and some other commands have a `--dump-transaction-message` option, but pasting a signed transaction gives `Error: Bad parameter: Unable to decode transaction` (I specify `base64` as encoding)
warning: expensive and slow
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getParsedProgramAccounts
Is there a web3 api call to get all accounts owned by a program Id?
yeah, but here's one issue. I didn't get the account that's in my phantom wallet as `wallet 1`. and what index could that be on in the seed derivation, anything. I think its better to store the PK of the account for instant access at all times. the example you showed earlier for PK is good. thanks!
awesome üëç
oh I tried `seed.slice(32,64)` this gave me another one and it worked. I assume you have to go forward in this order.
Not what I expected. I don't know how the anchor build works, but I'd expect it would remove the target on build start. Glad things are working out for you though
this worked. gave me an account when I do `keyPair.publicKey.toBase58()` thanks. I have a question. how do I get my other accounts since its a seed phrase, like 10?
<@!489206164270350337>
I deleted the target folder and built again and it works. Is this the expected behaviour?
I haven't tested this, but I've seen others have success with it:
```
let seed = bip39.mnemonicToSeedSync(mnemonic)
let keypair = Keypair.fromSeed(seed.slice(0, 32))
```
thanks. this shows me how to access my account via PK using `bs58.decode` however, is there a way if I don't have the private key of any account but the seed phrase only.
Also, you could use wallet-adapter https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter if trying to access phantom accounts via website
Check out the phantom part here https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/tour/create-keypair.html
um is there another way I can programmatically access my phantom accounts? <@!489206164270350337>
You're trying to go from mnemonic to web3.keypair?
how to use `web3.KeyPair` with the seed phrase? passing as is to `web3.KeyPair.fromSeed("seed phrase words")` doesn't work
just want to check when you test for aury token, have you modified porgram's const ,`STEP_TOKEN_MINT_PUBKEY` to your aury token's address?
the error `Provided seeds do not result in a valid address` will happen when your PDA is on curve but when you use findProgramAddress, it shouldn't happen.
I just guessing you pass something mismatch between your client and program.

In your program, you want to lookup token account that someone holds when they execute against it?
i wanted to read accounts for different tokens that they hold, how can i do that in programs?
Where do you find this information on step's repo about the vaultBump?
Instructions are what you execute to make changes
which have api calls defined in them right?
You can call instructions on the program
So my understanding of the error is that either the provided seeds are incorrect, or the program itself has a bug. Trying to figure out which with Step's specific program
that means i can make api calls in the contract as well?
<@!489206164270350337> just updated the problem, even with a bump of 255 I get an error with aurory's mint address as a seed

hey <@!742503796818837567> , just an update. I made a new successful PR with the right brackets and I moved it to a different location
Im working on localnet
I'm using this staking program.
https://github.com/step-finance/step-staking/blob/main/programs/step-staking/src/lib.rs

When I call the init function I need to provide the token_vault PDA which is computed like this:
`
const [vaultPubkey, vaultBump] = await findProgramAddress(
    [token.toBuffer()],
    program.programId
  )
`

It works fine with some token addresses but for the token address of the AURY token I get:
`'Program failed to complete: Could not create program address with signer seeds: Provided seeds do not result in a valid address'`

The only difference I saw between this PDA and the working PDA was that the bump was 255 for the working one, and 249 for the not working one with my AURY's mint address.

I tried to deploy on a different program id to get a bump of 255 and I got the same error.
I'm a little bit lost as I have no idea what's going on.
Hey ,Thanks alot this worked .Also ,Can't we update account.data field size. If i want to store map of tokenid to address how do i init size of account.data field .
What problem are you having?
smart contracts = program
no, i meant smart contract referred to as programs in solana ecosystem

Oh ok
If it has the same seed, I would expect it would be the same PDA
I am not sure how mainnet will currently play out.
And what if the is multiple PDA with the same seed ?
If i understand correclty
So all things that get deployed on the mainnet-beta will be on the future mainnet as well?

Its been 36 hours but I didn't add the right brackets so i think that's why its not updating
Nice, thank you
Check in solexolorer or solscan in a few days putting the name of your token. And you will see it.
That is correct üëç
Awesome. I will check to try to do something similar. If it's say automerge will be approved in a couple of days, i guess. That happen to me with my first token.
So, if i understand correctly, we can retrieve all PDA, with the seed we setup right, like in web3.js PublicKey::findProgramAddress(), this is how we don't loose created program state account ?

i am actually working on a buildspace project. 
i created a web app that takes gif link submissions. i changed my app so that the program id is the new one, but when i connect my wallet to this app with the new program id, for some reason the old gif link submissions popped up too
If you had a new program id, you should have new data. How are you interacted with it?
hmm. i think i need to go read more about solana. üòÖ 

I decided to deploy a new program, so i got a new program id. but when I interacted with this new program, old data from the old program showed up too. i
You can redeploy to the same program ID
thank you for taking the time to answer. 
ah, that might be it. sorry, still learning here. (relatively new with this).

Each program has a different ID though, right?
When you say old submitted data, are you talking about old data on the accounts? When you redeploy the program, it only changes the program code, not the accounts
Check out Metaplex's discord for more information about their program https://discord.gg/metaplex

DId you increase the size of the GREETING_SIZE and redeploy the program?
Trying to figure why `getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount` doesnt accept the parameter `allowOwnerOffCurve` to pass to `getAssociatedTokenAddress`. Was this intentional? and if yes why? Can a PDA not have an associated token account?

My use case is that I would like to use the pda of an associated token account as `vaults` to hold tokens of a specific mint.
I am deriving BorshSerialize and BorshDeserialize . Serialize  Code in 
lib.rs-

Then Idk sorry about the confusion
I know you can change the metadata I've been in projects where they did that
well then how do they do reveals?
It is not possible
I need some help with changing the metadata of an already minted nft anyony here that is able to help me with this?
Also, what is the snippet of code you are performing the serial/deserial?
If you are using Borsh (`try_to_vec`) you need to derive the `BorshSerialize` and `BorshDeserialize` traits on your GreetingAccount struct
Hello everyone, which solana web3 json rpc api should I use to let a user send an NFT ?
I am creating a Dapp to 'swap' NFT.. please help
Hello
I am developing a storefront to sell NFTs created with the Metadata Program (the same as star atlas) and I would like to know if it is possible to use the token vault from Metaplex to make an instant sale between a token (like usdc) and my nfts (that are essencially normal tokens with metadata)

If not, how should I proceed to do this? is there an audited escrow available?
I modified hello world program struct to two fields like this -

> #[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Debug)]
> pub struct GreetingAccount {

>

hey all, gotta newbie question, how much does it typically cost to deploy a program onto mainnet?
yes its a local version you can use for testing and development
How to get seed or keypair from phantom wallet connection?
hi guys, im new to solana dev and im just wondering, is the test validator same as the local solana cluster that i can use as rpc instead of using devnet/testnet?
anyone here experience with arweave and the Hashlips engine to generate an nft collection? I use Hashlips to generate the metaplex data json file. But it doesn't seem to store it in an arweave URI. So the question is how do I use arweave to store my nft's so I can change the metadata later on?
token keypair is private key. please try to use private key json file. this  address is only for this token. should not be user account.
ok, one more time. when we call `spl-token create-token` it generates new unique random token, which in turns appear on current blockchain with single instction `Initialize Mint` in explorer.
For example I created new token on testnet: https://explorer.solana.com/address/FibvgxMKzEch3YBhVFnjPpDRu3Fk5BRuXbHSosnuj88F/instructions?cluster=testnet now I can create accounts derived from token (+my current keypair) that's cool!

but now if I check same Token address (FibvgxMKzEch3YBhVFnjPpDRu3Fk5BRuXbHSosnuj88F) on `devnet` and `mainnet-beta` it's empty record and seems that I still can run `spl-token create-token` with --url switch, however without any extra argument it will create NEW tokens. --help said that there is argument <TOKEN_KEYPAIR> and if I run `spl-token create-token -v -ud FibvgxMKzEch3YBhVFnjPpDRu3Fk5BRuXbHSosnuj88F` now it says:

 ```
error: missing signature for supplied pubkey: FibvgxMKzEch3YBhVFnjPpDRu3Fk5BRuXbHSosnuj88F
```

so is there any way to create same token (and then associated accounts) in ALL Solana clusters?

Hello.  This was probably asked a million times.  But I try to upload a second token to solana's list and the pr always fails.  Any ideas?  Doing it by dexlab is easier or is it the same?
My Token Program can we update metadata of that nft minted by using smartcontract  ? or Is there any other way to maintain metadata of the token minted ?
hello everybody, i'm trying to retokenise on a project meaning i want to transfer token to people who own my previous tokens, but since people have listed them in a marketplace now i'm not sure how can i get the people who are holding my tokens in their wallets. since if they  list an NFT in a marketplace the token is transferred from their token account to a wallet that is owned by the marketplace, so i can't think of way to get the current holders of a token. i do have all the token addresses in a Database any help would be greatly appreciated.
Do you guys have a good solution how to find whether your NFT is listed on the marketplace or not?


Please can someone help me with this. I am following this tutorial https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/ I have implemented the program using the script Paulx provided, I am trying to implement it using UI https://github.com/paul-schaaf/escrow-ui. When I run is I can only see Alice side of the Ui but not Bobs', but in the code I saw what seems to be an implementation of both UIs  attached below. When I also open the router I also saw what seems to be an importation of both codes. Can someone help to understand/show me what to do in other to see both UIs. Attached is the screenshots of Alice UI implementation, Bob's UI implementation and the router for both. I will appreciate any help. Thanks.
the getProgramAccounts function returns all the tokens owned by a certain program and let's say it returns 5 addresse are those address in the sequence of their creation or returned randomly?

I think you can just put `provider.wallet` as signer
how are you getting `user`? From a keypair on disk, or through a wallet provider like phantom?
Thanks so just one more stupid question from my side üòÖ  how do i fix this? By just using account?
you marked `user` as signer, so that needs to sign
It is my dev acoount
not a good idea to share the passphrase in the public!
Okay, my program looks like this, maybe you can tell me what im missing

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> ProgramResult {
        Ok(())
    }

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = user, space = 512)]
    pub base_account: Account<'info, BaseAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```
let seed = bip39.mnemonicToSeedSync(mnemonic)
let keypair = Keypair.fromSeed(seed.slice(0, 32))
```
let baseAccount = Keypair.fromSeed("sun disorder joke plunge chalk boring shaft crucial valley valid diamond talk");

Using this leads to error,  what the seed here is it the passphrase ?
you need to pass everything that is used in your program to sign things
Lovely... thank you
afaik yes

Gang I am just analysing some output from the getTransaction method of the JSON RPC API, which gives me output of the following form for a given transaction id (output condensed for brevity):

{[...]
   'postBalances': [498499985000, 1000000000, 946560, 1, 1141440],
   'postTokenBalances': [],
   'preBalances': [498999990000, 500000000, 946560, 1, 1141440],
   'preTokenBalances': [],
   [...],
  'transaction': {'message': {'accountKeys': ['HErcsjc2Z2aY9QbW4rDm8jcDtFAahhPr58ZKnZx2b2et',

     '352U4Di38H5izWn4mKafJQtkkZordVneNa9xpPApKEM8']}},
[...] }

Can I always assume safely that the order of the accounts in postBalances and preBalances will always match the order of the accounts in accountKeys ?
First thanks for trying to help me <@!788215642070581289>  I appreciate that.
Maybe Im just to new to this but I thought I need to sign a program like this

export default async () => {
    const { baseAccount, provider, program } = useWorkspace()

    try {
        await program.rpc.initialize({
            accounts: {
                baseAccount: baseAccount.publicKey,
                user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
                systemProgram: web3.SystemProgram.programId,
            },
            signers: [baseAccount] <== dont know what to put in here as a base account
        })
    } catch (err) {
        console.log("Transaction error: ", err)
    }
}
in the devnet, this address is not a mint account. you have to init this account as a mint in devnet
check `spl-token create-token --help`
is it possible at all?
but I want to do same on devnet!
maybe try `spl-token create-account -v 7Jimij6hkEjjgmf3HamW44d2Cf5kj2gHnfCDDPGxWut -um`
I think your default connection not assign to mainnet
not sure I understand `sign custom programs`
when your wallet sign a tx, then all first level instructions will treat your wallet as a signer
here is my token on mainnet: https://explorer.solana.com/address/7Jimij6hkEjjgmf3HamW44d2Cf5kj2gHnfCDDPGxWut
well, I passed it, whole string was `spl-token create-account -v 7Jimij6hkEjjgmf3HamW44d2Cf5kj2gHnfCDDPGxWut`
in solana, there are two different accounts, mint account and token account
mint account is token address like SRM, USDC...
token account is holder of token
so back to your qn
If you use `spl-token create-account`, you will pass a `mint` as the parameter.
Thanks for your reply, but this only shows how to sign transactions not custom programs
hey guys, willing to create a project on the solana blockchain nft/ stacking/cashback and was wondering the cost of it? ( range price)
you can use some derived rule to maintain it. maybe based on user's wallet or some seed.

Hi I‚Äôm new to discord and new to Solana development, so upfront I‚Äôm very sorry if this has already been answered. 
Im trying to develop an application in Solana and want to sign an custom contract (program.rpc.) with my connected wallet (if that‚Äôs the right way to do it), but I don‚Äôt find any resources for that.
All recourses use a generated keypair, but how do I use my wallet to sign a transaction?
I don't think you can do it. Actually account data is stored as a uint8 array.
you need to know how program serialize it so that you can deserialize it correctly
API can parse accounts for you which are build-in account like token, stake, vote...
if you want to parse a custom program's account, I think the only you can do is to know how its program serialize it
I am using get_account_data but it is built on getAccountInfo RPC method
is that the api method you are using?
but, i can look at the file to see if maybe it has something that could help
and what i did was simply pass a parameter
unfortunately i was working in python, and the api wrapper method i was using was the getAccountInfo
Can you point to some resources please?
In EVM we have the abi and consequently can generate the method signatures to query but here I have to idea how to guess the data structure.
i was able to have my api deserialize for me into json format
I am trying to learn the rust solana-sdk by developing a client that queries different smart contracts?

$20 USD is $20 USD...
if you make it cost 1 sol, today thats 250, tomorrow its 300, the next its 200, etc.
i'd say it depends more on whether you want a fixed or fluctuating price
I would assume SOL, but most tutorials use USDC, so not sure.
Just curious does it make sense to price a Serum market in SOL? or USDC?
I appreciate the long write up, <@!785084693023424542>  I'll dive into this and might come back with some comments. I feel like having some entry points for locking/freezing smart contracts in the event of contracts being hacked are acceptable. Having the entire contract upgradeable  by a few devs diminishes the value of decentralisation. Again, I am happy to be educated. Cheers.
just wondering if there is a way to validate a solana address (similar to checksum)

i know there should be one I am just unsure how to derive it
hihi
hi there - on https://solana.com/news/getting-started-with-solana-development
the link to "You can access these SDKs on the Solana Developers Page." is broken (missing : in http)
the argument for upgradeable contracts is fairly straight forward. given the cumbersome challenege of deploying and communicating upgrades, and expecting or hoping users make the updates themselves, has been proven to have rather innefeicient, potentially brutal consequences, and genrally slow and cumbersome,  especially when attacks, vulnerabilities, bugs, and feature upgrades are truly considered. this has literally cost communities 100s of millions and future cost of billions of dollars. all when a  contract could have been updated, not requiring users or implementors to do anything.  considering this, along with the knowledge that rolling out upgrades fixes security measures and features is much faster, while most inherintly trusting contract devs over attackers to begin with, which appears to the heavier risk?  in addition there is also the feature or flexibility to essentially lock. and as a dev or user, you can make the choice to not trust or use the program or source.. even validate the program if you suspect changes and discontinue use. if your familiar eith eth params and proxies, then while the point that a contract is immutable may be true, it might not mean what most are led to believe. https://betterprogramming.pub/not-all-smart-contracts-are-immutable-create-upgradable-smart-contracts-e4e933b7b8a9
hey guys, any idea on how one can get a sort of "updated_at" thingy on accounts?

Hai, I need to fetch the available token list for our app, can anyone help me to list them out
thanks <@!785084693023424542> my concern is the fact that all the major contracts are still upgradeable. In Ethereum, if you build against Uniswap, you know that Uniswap contract is immutable forever. If Uniswap upgrades, it'd be another contract. As a UI client, I can decide when to upgrade my UI to point to the new contract. Should we expect the main protocols in Solana to finalize their contracts at some points ? Orca & Saber are holding billions and their contracts are still upgradable. This is quite concerning.
it depends on the contracts your invoking, and it is up to each program to implement good practices like versioning along with updating their community. on the UI end, there is always a chance something can go wrong, so always try to build your UI in a way that gracefully fails instead of breaks. you can treat contract/program calling like you would any other API in this scenario from a front end perspective.
question on integration, hope someone might be able to answer - if I build a UI that invokes other smart contracts (ie. Raydium or Serum), how likely that my UI will break because Serum or Raydium upgrade their smart contracts ? It looks like most major smart contracts on Solana are not immutable (ie. has upgrade authority)
you're a saver ! thanks <@!788215642070581289>

Here is typescript code (stale, written way back) of creating a new account owned by the program and funded by the wallet:
```javascript
const tokenAccount = new Account();
  const lamports = await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(TOKEN_ACCOUNT_STATE_SPACE);
  const transaction = new Transaction().add(
    SystemProgram.createAccount({
      fromPubkey: walletAccount.publicKey,
      newAccountPubkey: tokenAccount.publicKey,
      lamports,
      space: TOKEN_ACCOUNT_STATE_SPACE,
      programId,
    }),
  );
  const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
    connection,
    transaction,
    [walletAccount, tokenAccount],
    {
      commitment: 'singleGossip',
      preflightCommitment: 'singleGossip',
    },
  );
  console.log(
    'Using token account',
    tokenAccount.publicKey.toBase58(),
    'Transaction Signature:',
    transactionSignature
  );
  return tokenAccount;
```
The wallet is the `payer` which is why you need it's keys
Yes
i'm a newbie here, but i think the way this funding happens is by the signing of the transaction for the account who is funding it
Here is a Rust example:
```rust
fn new_account(
    rpc_client: &RpcClient,
    wallet_signer: &dyn Signer,
    account_pair: &dyn Signer,
    program_owner: &Pubkey,
    state_space: u64,
    initialize_instruction_id: u8,
    commitment_config: CommitmentConfig,
) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let account_lamports = rpc_client
        .get_minimum_balance_for_rent_exemption(state_space as usize)
        .unwrap();

    let instruction_data = vec![vec![initialize_instruction_id]];

    let mut transaction = Transaction::new_with_payer(
        &[
            system_instruction::create_account(
                &wallet_signer.pubkey(),
                &account_pair.pubkey(),
                account_lamports,
                state_space,
                program_owner,
            ),
            Instruction::new_with_borsh(
                *program_owner,
                &instruction_data,
                vec![
                    AccountMeta::new(account_pair.pubkey(), false),
                    AccountMeta::new(wallet_signer.pubkey(), false),
                ],
            ),
        ],
        Some(&wallet_signer.pubkey()),
    );

    let (recent_blockhash, _fee_calculator) = rpc_client
        .get_recent_blockhash()
        .map_err(|err| format!("error: unable to get recent blockhash: {}", err))
        .unwrap();
    transaction
        .try_sign(&vec![wallet_signer, account_pair], recent_blockhash)
        .map_err(|err| format!("error: failed to sign transaction: {}", err))
        .unwrap();
    let _signature = rpc_client
        .send_and_confirm_transaction_with_spinner_and_commitment(&transaction, commitment_config)
        .map_err(|err| format!("error: send transaction: {}", err))
        .unwrap();
    let _account = rpc_client
        .get_account_with_commitment(&account_pair.pubkey(), commitment_config)
        .map_err(|err| format!("error: getting account after initialization: {}", err))
        .unwrap();

    Ok(())
}
```
That is why account creation (1  system instruction) and account initialization (1 program instruction) are often bound together in the same transaction
The funding (funder?) of the account and creation of the account happen unbeknownst to the program. If you create an instruction for the program and include an account the system will verify write access by the program.
I'm not really well-versed in the solana mechanics myself, so I might not be completely right here. To my understanding, what you'd do is store data in a program-derived address, the seed of which is the original (system) user account's pubkey. This would make it so for a given user, you could always retrieve their data. You probably wouldn't be able to iterate over all accounts your program owned (at least I'm not sure how something like that could be done), but that would also be a feature of ethereum, where you can't iterate on the elements of a map.
is that like another instruction* where the user pays the program?
how does a program accept the funding for a new account
1. Yes
2. Someone has to fund the account, user wallet or other
3. Solana Program are 'owner' of account, not necessarily the funding but the account needs to be owned by the program to have it's state changed by that program
(1) Is it possible for a solana program to create an account on behalf of the user, in which the user's account data is stored?

(2) Is the user paying for that account to be created?

(3) Is it only the solana program which created the account who can change it's data?
Do you know how long it takes to show up on Solana explorer?
This worked! Thanks for all your help üòÑ
Hey, sorry to ping, but would you happen to know why my token isn't updating? I did a successful PR almost 24 hrs ago https://explorer.solana.com/address/GCxgQbbvJc4UyqGCsUAUa38npzZX27EMxZwckLuWeEkt
is someone able to add metadata to solana explorer on a token?
(although that's how you learn cool and interesting things... so it's worth going down some)
I got a million things to learn, need to avoid too many rabbit holes üòÑ
I think probably the only way to get a real answer to your question is to read the code.
I don't know, sounds like it would depend alot on implementation details.
Oh... I thought things like open nonce accounts and recent block hashes and account data would need to be cached in memory rather than read and processed as needed, otherwise wouldn't it be quite slow determining state from history when accessed?
can someone help to add metadata to a token on solana explorer (i think it's on metaplex on token-metadata file)? I've done the solana.tokenlist.json already
is there any API's to fetch all or a subset of NFT's on Solana? OpenSea provides an API to fetch all as they support trading of most NFT's on Ethereum/Polygon.
I don't understand.  What is 'leave them open' mean?  There is nothing that *has to* be kept in memory on a validator.  All ledger state is persistent, that's how all validators share it.
<@!888178749533720586> hope that helps üôÇ
`git checkout -p` would interactively ask if it should discard any given edited part of the file
if you have git installed in your terminal you can do `git add -p`, it will ask you if each edited section should be staged before commiting
Clone it then and do it locally - just abandon the old branch/PR, delete it if it's a simple one-line addition.
I'll give this a go
if i recall correctly github client does not allow one to select which chunks to commit, its only per file
yeah, im trynig to think how to do this in gh client
I would recommend:
* Preserve your changes/additions
* Reset the branch
* Make changes again, but this time use SourceTree or similar to see what changes are being staged and committed, it's possible to stage only some changes within a file, staging specific lines or a range of lines. Stage only your additions, review before committing, commit and push.
Correct üôÇ
you just want to add INK, correct?
so 2 changes that you didnt do: vs code cleaned up windows specific EOL characters
oh my
https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/3486
either is fine
Hmm okay. So you want to see my fork or the PR?
but my suspicion is that now your editor removed trailing whitespaces somewhere üôÇ (not a bad thing, just in this messy setup its annoying to deal with)
I don't even know what that is for, but I'm sure whoever owns it is aware of the issue and they're probably working on a million things... "make nice UI for submission system" is probably somewhere on their backlog. It might add value to make something crappy but functional in the short-term though.
so you can push changes in to your branch still, and it will update PR automatically, you can push your current changes now, so i can take a look at em
And it shows me these deletions and additions I didn't make
All I did was fork the repo, clone my fork, open it in vs code, add in my lines, push the changes to my fork, and make a pr
indeed, and most editors and github client, and web ui dont highlight special symbol changes
This process doesn't seem too great - a way for non-technical people to get confused by diffs and whitespace changes made by their editor.
did you push the changes?
Not entirely sure how to get rid of that, since I never edited either of those in the first place
There's the one in that screenshot, and one more
Well it's looking better now, but there are still 2 deletions showing that I didn't make.
<@!821639748652761121> actually I was thinking about nonce accounts, if people leave them open does that mean they need to stay in validator memory? Could this potentially be an attack vector? or just something that could become a problem with old/forgotten accounts over a long time with many more users (i.e. a future problem)? The process seems a bit odd to me, I'm sure there are good reasons it's like it is, but I'm wondering if a system-owned pool that you borrow tokens from could also work and if it would be any better. ü§î
Might I recommend https://freeflow.dev/
Awesome! Look forward to if you update any of the docs to help others
<@!489206164270350337> thanks for all your help btw - Tyera solved it in a few seconds once I'd written a script that showed exactly the problem. Explaining stuff in discord is never as clear as some code! üòÑ - anyhow, no nonce account needed, it works üôÇ
yeah try to get unchanged file and edit it in VS code, i think however you edited the file it replaced all unix EOL characters, thats why entire file is changed.
That'd be the cat's pajamas eh? üôÇ
Basically in the front end we divide the entire buffer on logical boundaries. We iterate those chunks imbuing what 'chunk' this is out of the total 'chunks'. We store/append those chunks to the accounts state. When we get the last chunk we process it based on the business instruction (vs. chunk transmit instructions)
Yeah I guess - I haven't looked much into the RPC API yet. But it seems weird that you need to rebuild the transaction with all the same details, and take the signature from the offline-signed process. The `--sign-only` already outputs some JSON, it could include all details and be the input for `submit-transaction` perhaps.. anyway - I'll take a look at the docs, and try to fix my build issues.
I just added it straight from github. I didn't use an editor. Should I try using vs code and pushing the changes from there?
which editor did you use?
If i open it in my vim i see that EOL characters are now windows specific, not unix /r/n or whateves is default
Glad to have been of service
Thanks!
wow I think that worked
I don't understand why it's saying so much of it is deleted/added when all I did was add my info at the bottom
You could try reaching out on general instead of developer-support. You really are looking for software engineers.
https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/solana-labs/token-list/pull/3481.diff
<@!213083996689661953> I just tried to replay it - doesn't work I'm glad to see üòÑ
Oh, I see. I was stuck on offline signing. You mean, just a wrapper around this? https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#sendtransaction ... and maybe some RpcClient niceties around commitment, confirmation, and progress spinner.
https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/3481\
whats your PR link?
I noticed you were doing `AccountMeta::new(spl_token::id(), false)`. This by default sets it as a writable account. You could try `AccountMeta::new_readonly(spl_token::id(), false)`. It depends on what you're going for
I think such a command would never try to sign the transaction - it should always be already signed, no?
Spacing on what exactly? Mine looks the exact same as the next few above
I think the reason we haven't implemented something like `submit-transaction` in the cli is to protect users from attaching a signature to a serialized transaction without knowing what the transaction does. But of course it's certainly possible to write a rust client that would deserialize a transaction body, populate the offline signature, and reserialize to submit the transaction via RpcClient.
I can't get it working
I am looking to create a Pharmacy Application on the ecosystem.  I am not a coder/developer but would like to hire a firm/group of people to do this. What is the best way to find companies/orgs/people/agencies to develop these smart contracts? Am I looking for someone that can write in RUST? What job titles would I be searching for? I apologize ahead of time for the laymen term usage but I am a professional health care provider so I am trying my best to understand the lingo.
You probably changed the spacing or something
Anyone know why my pull request is showing 23,18 deletions?
Yeah - I had to infer many things using `--help` and asking here. I figured that was just very dated.
Yes, absolutely! PRs always welcome, and we especially love doc improvements.
I noticed that those doc example are still using the deprecated `solana pay` cli command, so if you dig in there, it would be wonderful if you could update those to `solana transfer`
I also think that the order of args on the command line affected something in a weird way I didn't expect. Wanted to look into that but got confused by the tests and couldn't get tests running locally anyway.

Also what are your (or anyone else's) thoughts on a `submit-transaction` or similar command?
<@!213083996689661953> omg thank you SOOO much! you have no idea how long I spent trying to make this work yesterday (it was over 12 hours). I'd like to start contributing, could I have a go at updating the docs for offline signing?
Yes, that's when I get the hang.
Any idea why this is happening <@!489206164270350337> ? I appreciate your time
Did you try `AccountMeta::new(spl_token::ID, true),`?
that's the one!
<@!489206164270350337> Any tips?
I have to see how to use it
Does this solve your issue?
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/program-test/src/programs.rs
lol
oh shit
I was trying to find where that's documented but am lacking in google-fu at the moment
yep, no idea anymore lol, is IDK, is the latter (spl_associated_token_account) included in the test harness?
And I can only reproduce it with one of these two accounts.
Just `Error: transport io error: Client dropped expired request.`
sorry for the false alarm
egh, I'm dumb, I was using a `~` in the path and obviously that made the env made
Does it give an error with the timeout?
But there's no hang for any other pubkey lol
I can't view the lines. It says `23,199 additions, 23,183 deletions not shown because the diff is too large. ` I'm confused why it's saying I've deleted so much when I never deleted anything
It also hangs if I put them in manually like:
```
let spl_token_id = Pubkey::from_str("TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA").unwrap();
let ass_token_id = Pubkey::from_str("ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL").unwrap();
```
Yes
What is the exact error? I ran into this when I installed Rust using brew. Had to install using the command on Rust's site
for some reason when I do the normal install from the website and `cargo test-bpf` it gets command not found. I added the bin folder to the path too because `solana --version` works fine
The should still exist to my knowledge
Does the test timeout after 60 seconds?
<@!489206164270350337> I created a GH issue: <https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/21210> Full steps to reproduce, and a script to simulate the offline transaction locally, using `devnet` üôÇ
Any clue why? It makes no sense.
Any advice on why my token name/logo isn't changing after 14 hrs successful merge? Name is NUTS
Yo, using `solana-program-test`, I can get it to hang when I add one of these to my `Instruction::new_with_bytes()`:
```
AccountMeta::new(spl_token::ID, false),
AccountMeta::new(spl_associated_token_account::id(), false),
```
hi all, does anyone know if test-bpf and build-bpf were taken out of the CLI installation process in the last few months?
Check the lines changed. It'll tell you what you deleted
Hmm it says pull request should not contain any deletions, but never deleted anything. What should I do?
Thanks for your help üôè
You could use that as well
If you follow the given stackoverflow example, they're using `transfer` from `@solana/spl-token`
That's from Anchor. You're using the transfer function from Ancher. I'm not all too familiar with Anchor yet, but you could try their discord for Anchor specific sdk questions https://discord.gg/xXA4TGpA
But I don't find information relating to this..
From this import
Where did you get `NodeWallet` from?
You are my last hope üòÖ
I am struggling so much... Can you explain me what argument should I pass at wallet ? üôè
you are awesome, thank you Jacob
Yes. Both provided answers should work based on your use case
Hi guys, has anyone been working with a transfer custom token function on solana-web3 ? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68236211/how-to-transfer-custom-token-by-solana-web3-js
X means you did something wrong. `yarn install` should work, looks like something is wrong with your local config
You pay for the space allocation. Check out https://www.brianfriel.xyz/understanding-program-derived-addresses/ for a ton of good info on PDAs
Also, for adding to token-list, is my pull request supposed to have a red X next to it (like most do) or did I actually do something wrong?
Hello, I'm hoping someone can help me figure out this error when I clone the wallet-adapter repo and run `yarn install` I get this error:
```An unexpected error occurred: "UNKNOWN: unknown error, lstat 'C:\\Users\\reece\\AppData\\Local\\Yarn\\Cache\\v6\\npm-@babel-runtime-corejs3-7.16.0-58a7fb00e6948508f12f53a303993e8b6e2f6c70-integrity\\node_modules\\@babel\\runtime-corejs3\\core-js-stable\\symbol\\is-concat-spreadable.js'".```
one last question actually... mainly for Program derived addresses, do i pay for the allocation? or do i pay for how much space is actually taken up by data?
good to know then, thanks so much Jacob
ohh okay gotcha
Accounts that the program itself is stored in
are you talking about Program-Derived Addresses? Or are you talking about the account that the program itself gets stored in
Check out `Reclaiming Program Data Accounts` here https://jstarry.notion.site/Program-deploys-29780c48794c47308d5f138074dd9838
If you close program data accounts, the corresponding program and program id will be effectively disabled and cannot be redeployed
" Program data accounts can never be recreated for an existing program."
what do you mean by this?
Cost is different. You pay based on space. Accounts can be reallocated, but you may not want to do that depending on your situation (close, open). Program data accounts can never be recreated for an existing program.
is there a doc somewhere that talks about how Account space allocation works?
Can I allocate then re-allocate? does allocating a smaller space vs a larger space cost anything different? stuff like that
Right? I cancel my magazine subscription and they turn around and freeze my account? Yeah, no thanks lol
The problem is that the funds were transferred with consent and a signed transaction... Trying to say that you didn't complete the transaction is nigh impossible...
decentralization all the way
i dont mean to sound cruel but im so so glad that Solana does not have the power to help you in that manner lol
NUTS
üëè
We do not have that kind of power. This is a decentralized network
Cuz I can provide wallet with stolen funds
Anything like freeze funds or anything?
We cannot do anything about people moving funds
My community is important like your core contributors
Look at the issue pl asap
Please do not tag our core contributors
There is Fake $Meow token listed on dex lab that rugged $50k worth usd by scamming people with fake $Meow token on dexlab. We tried contacting dexlab but no answer from that folks.
Our community people lost 4k$-5k$ with that scam token , and that token owner used our logo.
If solana can stop that scammer from moving money that can be great.
Solcats ($Meow) admin
I must of failed filling out the pull request??
Also the file itself isn't a valid JSON file... I'm not sure how they are using the main file in their production code at all to deploy people's tokens.
until no errors left.
i ran 'npm install' and one by one whittled down the issues.
Are you sure that actually causes an issue?
Don't see it in the token list at this time
<@489206164270350337>
do you have a link to your own implementation?
true lol
https://explorer.solana.com/address/9uci22qsC7tdCR5TqyVtbnMzFR8fiZj3nShavYFnZzid
Link to coin in explorer?
So any official Solana devs here? I fixed the issues with the tokenlist file... but still can't auto-merge as there needs to be deletions on the file (as some silly-willys put the same address twice for the same token on the same chainId and other stuff like that):
https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/3454
<@489206164270350337> could my coin b failing to obtain img an name due to I skipped the freeze mint??
its a file example but data is data eh? üòé
We used this as the original inspiration: https://github.com/mcf-rocks/solana-upload
yes, i do need larger... do you have further information on this? would be greatly appreciated
It been 13days fo me an still no fix ://
What is the spl's name?
ohhhhhh, thank you haha
You can send the NFT, but you'll still have a token account. It'll just be balance of 0
Anyone know why my token isn't updated with name/logo on solscan / explorer yet? PR was merged successfully around 12 hours ago https://explorer.solana.com/address/GCxgQbbvJc4UyqGCsUAUa38npzZX27EMxZwckLuWeEkt
Check the above repo.
how difficult is this to do? Are there any sample code projects which walk you through creating your own staking program?
https://github.com/step-finance/reward-pool
No, not stakeable. Step open-sourced their staking protocol though
So Raydium and Serum provide ways to easily make your SPL created tokens stakeable?
ya, I used phantom wallet to send an NFT over on devnet. But even on Solana explorer it says I am the owner even though its in the other person's wallet
Are you positive you closed them and/or have your connection on devnet?
If you have larger data sizes you'll have to get into a staging data chunk state model (we've done it)
you have to allow for the AccountMeta data as well
The maximum size of a transaction (which includes 1 or more Instructions) is 1232 bytes, this may or may not change in the future
Hey guys! Anyone have an idea on why getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner is populating with accounts that I no longer have on devnet?
what is the maximum amount of data you can pass into the data byte array in an entrypoint?
yes üôÇ
ok
My understanding is dataslice is grabbing the slice of each account instead of what you're thinking
but the doc is not clear to be honest
thanks will check
probably other people run into this issue because you have something called data slice with an offset and length but it's actually not a pagination
You can find the recordings here https://discord.gg/metaplex
ok what was the explanation
Monday's office hours had an explanation on how to get statistics for Metaplex from the program accounts. More than you have run into this issue
it kind of looks like pagination
I thought that was the point of dataSlice
I don't believe there is pagination right now
It's for a bot / statistics on collections I am building they won't do this request
https://discord.gg/metaplex
I know but I just request a very small subset
Check out metaplex discord to see how they're currently grabbing these
Sounds like there may be something client side canceling, or your rpc provider has that set. It is slow because it's enormous
Hello, I am trying to get program accounts from Metaplex, it's a quite large request so I tried using data slices, this is my RPC request

{"method":"getProgramAccounts","params":["metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s",{"encoding":"base64","dataSlice":{"offset":0,"length":5},"commitment":"confirmed"}],"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0}

But this is the response I get
The request was canceled due to the configured HttpClient.Timeout of 100 seconds elapsing.

It times out after a 100 seconds ? do you know why it is so slow, I would have imagined the RPC validator would just need to read a few bytes of a file and send me, do you know what's wrong with my call ? How can I improve the speed
Includes any rpc calls that you may need
You'll have to convert the borsh deserialization, but here's a ts example https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/get-account-nfts/getAccountNFTs.ts

ok, thats literally what i need to do, thank you üôÇ
aye
combo borsh and code

I was hoping i can just be lazy and let borsch handle everything, but now i know i have to do some coding üôÇ
The way I prepared is I chunk up the beginning of the buffer for fixed values including the size of the variable (even though it is fixed today)
gotcha, thanks a lot!
Today you have to pre-allocate, as per <@!489206164270350337> you would need to determine that dynamically when the feature to do so is in, yes.
so i need to preallocate then, or reinitialize accounts when i detect that my state grew, is that correct?
That'd be grand! üôÇ
So you have that as your data space and can chunk it up as you see fit
Account data is not currently dynamically sized. It will be in the future I believe(1.9)
Correct, the size of an account's data is fixed at creeation time
I have a qusetion: what is the correct way to handle varsize state in solana program? I see that account.data is Rc<RefCell<&mut [u8]>>> which is slice, which cant grow.
Alternatively you could creating your own staking program for your token.
I would check in on Raydium and Serum. They have guides and walkthroughs for each
https://discord.gg/raydium
https://discord.gg/NtQSyfn4
Run the test on local and try to fix
The specific code posted can be done with nodejs. It has the following accounts:
1. Online funded account
2. Online nonce account
3. Offline funded account
4. Offline nonce account
The flow goes like this:
1. Online account creates nonce account
2. Offline account creates the create-nonce-account transaction with online account as payer and using the online nonce account's nonce
3. Offline signs transaction
4. Online account signs and broadcasts

The idea is to not have to be running against the clock for the original create-nonce-account. This way you could have a totally offline account + offline nonce account. You could do all this without any online account at all, but you'll be racing the clock against the blockhash becoming invalid.
hmm does it say which JSON line the issue is on?

        Types of property 'name' are incompatible.
        Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.
Let me see..
Your build failed still. I would look into resolving the issues first
looks like CI is failing
Need an official dev from Solana to take a look to merge it.
My token addition auto-merged to this file last night .. but I'm guessing my SPL token's image/ticker isn't showing up in Phantom cause the file itself is still invalid. i dunno just a guess and hence why i submitted a PR.
i think their token-list file is invalid JSON format cause people probably putting bad data in (and putting in wrong spots without curly braces). I fixed the issues if anyone can take a look:
https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/3454
Tons. I think majority are here.
like official devs for Solana
any Solana devs here?
something is undefined, thats only thing i see from your code
The examples in the JS lib shows the tests creating a tx first and then passing it on for signature. Is that idiomatic?

It'll cost less as far as execution units go
yea üòõ And I can't have it generated on the frontend for sure. No worries, I can do it on the backend. Might be easier than trying to do this entire thing on-chain anyway.
Woof, yep... need that random üôÇ
It's a number guessing game
Okay, was hoping to do the entire thing on-chain. But I can put a backend together for it I guess.
In general, what's the use case
correct
yea, so I'd have to build an API essentially that would send transactions to the cluster
yes, you would have to have something on backend that generates transaction based on input from your frontend
Yes
It could be exploited that way
hmm okay, I din't want to generate the random number on the frontend
You can send as part of payload, yes
you can send random number as part of transaction i guess
Yea, I guess that makes sense. Do you have any recommendations on how to go about generating a random number? I'm trying to build a side project where I need to get a number between 0 - 1000
