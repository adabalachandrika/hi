Hey ya'll we're trying to figure out if we should launch our NFT game on Solana or Ethereum. Our key question is whether or not we can change the metadata of an NFT after minting. For example, if the NFT is sword with medium power in the metadata, it can be changed to high power later

Links, suggestions, sarcastic comments, all welcome üôè
any help with this would be greatly appreciated
Hello, If I use the Command Line Tool with "solana transaction-history --verbose --limit 1000 --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json myaccount"  it gave me the last 1.000 transactions .......
how could I see Inside each TX  with the command line tool  (solana client tools) ??
If you generated it once try to find and pass that address and it should be solved
Yes i did get this error..... It generates the using program addresses and I don't know of it in depth yet.. Check your to account for token account you would already have it created.
How do you make sure that each time you create an associated token address it will be unique?
is there a convenient way (preferably with an API) to get a list of holders for a specific token/nft
shouldn't it create new associated token address everytime it invokes the program?
<@!872000929719791646> did you also get this error before?
```

<@144408253059694592> pass in the destination address in place of payerAccount.publicKey
Thank you very much for taking the time to answer me (and to understand me :P)
any code snippet in js available for `spl-token transfer fund-recipient`?
how do you create the associated token account in the destination wallet tho?
Sorry bro I don't know of it's documentation
https://www.spl-token-ui.com/#/
. This is a graphical representation of the spl token program. Check it out it should help you out.
hey all, is https://github.com/project-serum/spl-token-wallet still considered the best open-source implementation of a wallet? if we wanted just the functional code, no ui, is there a better alternative?
Yes I understood that, but I don't know how to mint more tokens, or burn some, or I don't know what I can do with those token. For my learning, I'm trying to explore the possibility to what is possible to do.
And I'm also looking for a documentation for the web3js @solana/spl-token; so I can spend time to read all the functions, as the link I post just below.
When you create a token it is already belonging to the owner wallet. What kind of connection are you talking about?
I thought what you wrote was the answer to my problems üôÇ
Ok sorry, 
I'm a beginner and following some example found on the web, I create a token, but I'm looking how to make a connection to this token with the owner wallet, to try making some stuff.
I couldn't quite understand what you meant..
https://spl.solana.com/token
You can see proper examples of how transfer token to other user here...
Yes
?
is there a similar documentation for spl, looking to this one:
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/index.html
Hello,
Is this the solution to connect to a token, in order to re mint some tokens, make some Transactions ?
is this the token address you're referring to?
Address of the associated account. Whose type is of PublicKey.
hmm okay and what type is it? `PublicKey`?
Nope the token's address
the token account address right just to be specific
Address of the token
what is `TokenToTransfer`?
Doing this returns you the associated token account public key.
//     const token=new Token(connection,TokenToTrasnfer,TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,payerAccount);
//     const aso_acc=token.createAssociatedTokenAccount(payerAccount.publicKey)
I got the createAssociatedTokenAccount function from the spl token npm package.. And then just used...
do you mind pointing me to the documentation for creating an associated token account for the to wallet or a code snippet?
I think we need to first create an associated token account for the to wallet. Because when using spl token cli if we try to do it like this it doesn't work we have to add - - fund-recipient flag and what it does is it creates an associated account for the to address and then transfer the tokens
Is there any way to keep a metada onchain ?
is the `to` field correct tho? does it work if I pass in a public key of the dest wallet address?
anyone knows if I updated token-list and merged already, how long would it take to update to solana explorer and phantom wallet
I too wss stuck in the same problem today turned out that i was passing the token account address as the token itself changed it and it worked fine.
Yes
token account address is basically this right?
yeah `token_address` is the token account address as far as I understand, sorry for the bad naming convention
Did you try passing token account address instead of token address?
anyone knows if I updated token-list and merged already, how long would it take to update to solana explorer and phantom wallet
Hi, I'm trying to use @solana/web3.js to transfer token from source wallet to dest wallet where I only have the public key address of the dest wallet.

This is the code snippet
```
// Add token transfer instructions to transaction
    const transaction = new web3.Transaction().add(
        splToken.Token.createTransferInstruction(
            splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
            token_address,
            to,
            from.publicKey,
            [],
            1,
        ),
    );

    // Sign transaction, broadcast, and confirm
    const signature = await web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction(
        connection,
        transaction,
        [from],
        { commitment: process.env.COMMITMENT },
    );
    console.log('SIGNATURE', signature);
```

`token_address` is the address of the token account
`to` is a `PublicKey` object created from the dest wallet public key address
`from` is the `Keypair` created from source wallet's private key

when I run the program I get:
```
Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: invalid account data for instruction 
    Program TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA invoke [1]
    Program log: Instruction: Transfer

    Program TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA failed: invalid account data for instruction
```

anyone knows what I did wrong?
Does not hinder. At the end of the day it is one token. You can transfer one person at a time then that person can send it someone else so far and so fort.
Man the program log on the solana explorer looks too ugly after three or 4 invokes in one single transactionüòÇ  thank you!
i may have to use this instruction in the near future so kind of collecting info on it... also i'm looking for a way to whitelist wallet address so the program owner can send them NFTs as per his wish....
no, you have to do invoke twice.
yea, you writing some sort of escrow?

I actually am trying to figure out an NFT lending program that will allow the recipient to transfer the token to a whitelisted program account, in this case to stake a gaming NFT into the metaverse
i can try to simply simulate this scenario and will see what happens...
Meaning that approving my program an X amount of token will get the job done and transfer it to someone else if conditions are met....
hey guys! I'm reading through the web3.js docs right now but anyone knows how you can get a transaction history for a wallet/program? (if thats doable)

/edit: found this reply
that's to lock the token to prevent user from moving it while the order is still open
but yes, user grants approve to a program and it can move it. Serum dex actually creates a token account that belongs to the dex contract and the token is moved there while waiting for trade
I haven't gotten into the details that much
approve is similar to EVM call, I believe.
The example there would create a BTC/USDT market, the base is your token, the quote is what you're trading against
adding to @bex question, to accomplish this do we have to use the approve instruction? also can the program ID/address be approved for such transactions??
once you set the supply you have to burn the mint. Token name and symbol is PDA metadata, check Metaplex
yes, everything is done through spl-token program
here's an app that polls serum markets and writes event data to a redis database, should give you an idea. https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/serum-history
is it possible to do multiple instructions such as initialize_mint and initialize_account in one invoke function call?? i dont think it will be happening as invoke doesn't take an array of instrction nor does it have an sequence for matching the instructions...
Hi guys. I come from Ethereum world . I want to create a program which allows users to transfer token from program to other account (user passes in pubKey and amount, program sends x tokens to y address). In Ethereum it is possible for a contract to hold ERC-20 tokens and can transfer them during the contract execution. Is there a option for Solana program to own an account with token X and transfer this tokens during the contract call so anyone can sign this transfer tx?
And as well when i checking my token address at windows os solana explorer it says unknown token, i have buit our token on ubuntu os and there is shows our logo and etc . Why it is happening anyone can help me ?

Hi there,  a have a question about fixed token supply.If we set my token as fixed supply can we make a pre sale or can  transfer it to another investor or people ?Does it hinder us for this process??  Anyone help >
understandable....thank you....
yes kind of like that, as when a wallet call a mint instruction first the token(NFT)address is generated and using it's address it's related account is created..
wallet>NFT address>token account address function call goes in this sequence
so it goes wallet > token account address > nft address?
ah so you have a overall wallet address and then an address within that wallet for each nft/token?
I wouldn't say that. It simply that every instruction bust be a pure function. For a known set of parameters A we should get the same result B every time. No randoms, no web clients, no key creation.. as it brings nondeterminism.
when a token is transferred, an associated token account is created for the address that is on the receiving address hence the new address... as much as i know
in that sense when we writing a solana program we should write it's web3 first then the rust side?? since everything or most of the things are predetermined....??
No, you have to send a key of every account that is needed for that instruction to succeed. There are cases of calling findProgramAdress inside of program but thats just for verification purposes.

hello, does anybody have some documentation for implementing Solana into a Angular project?
Coming from eth where there's just an address for a wallet it's a bit confusing üòÖ
But shouldn't this mean the address (not the owner address) should stay consistent?
This is just a general kind of thing that I'm thinking, when we initialize a mint or a token account we have to send its pre generated key to the program using keypair.generate(), so i want to know is it possible to generate a keypair in the program itself so that we don't have to use the keypair to Create a keypair for either a mint or a token account? And then use that address to create an account or a token
Hey everybody! What should I input to "Quote Token Mint Address" when creating new market on Serum to create a pair of My token - SOL?
Address is the address of the token account and owner address is the account of the wallet or person that owns the account.
Do any genius here know how to reverse a transaction? I can still see the solana send in the other person's account.

Ah awesome thank you for your help! Am I right to say I‚Äôd need to have a JavaScript server always running and use the JS client SDK to listen for account changes?
No calling outside from the programs. You can subscribe to account changes and getTransactions when you receive an event.
Hi everyone üëã sorry for the noob question but I‚Äôd like to find a way to listen for events inside my Solana program in a way that can be store in a web 2 application in real time. The purpose of it would be to keep track of the progress of a web 3 game and display it in the landing page. Thus:

Is it possible to make an HTTP request within Solana programs to ping a web 2 API?

Otherwise, is there any way to notify web 2 to listen for specific program transactions and get access to their content?
why are you using invoke_signed but not giving any seeds?
<@!354755190949281795> no. It doesn't work like that. You don't deploy your nft smart contracts as eth. Look into Metaplex.

SPLIX is imported as spl-token::instruction ;
<@!401880349166141441> is there a template like openzeppelin for solana nfts
Ok i will i changed the flow a bit.... now just giving burn and transfer instruction and sending the associate token address from the CLI i'll send the here..
you can't do that from the spl-token cli.
can you make a gist or put code on pastebin or something?
when using the spl-token command line, I was able to create an nft, but the documentation didn't say how to add the metadata name and uri. How to do that in an spl token?
Also, is there a way to query tokens by creator or update authority?
How do I get all the transaction history for a collection? Or even the most recent data? I want to track Solanart attribute prices and I can see the transactions that have the data I want in the logs, but I don't know how to get all the past transaction data for a collection
anyone deployed their token to mainnet and also got it listed on some exchange?
look into candy machine, metaplex
did this still the same error....
I have created candymachine and set up date and price. How do do react app thing and take it to Website minting.  ?

I start to see the light <:cheesepepe:883831890262511676>  gl hf man
It takes time to get your head about all of it, take it easy
yeah there can be something that i cant seem to find missing there......
Yes in the front end code
by off chain what do you mean?? by simply calling the create associate token account using the web3?
but that might fix you for the time being
Idk, a suggestion. Should be fine to do all this in a program instruction though, you must be doing something else wrong <a:pepelaugh:834817527900799078>
(it's a benign operation that's unauthenticated)
Then you passe the derived adress of that account to the program and he just handle burn then transfer
in the associated instruction of the anchor call
Yep, the account creation can be done offchain
what i'm trying to do is when a user burn their NFT(spl-token 0 decimal) they receive another spl-token(having x decimals). to transfer that x  deciamls token i do need to create an associated token account..
> or can it be somehow achieved in one function call from the Web3 frontend?
Possibly, but then do you need a program or a script
> is there a better way to do this??
Very subjective, depend of what you are trying to achieve
> i'm giving it burn_instruction,create_token_associated_account and then trasnfer_instruction in one call?? 
Technically this should not eat the full computing budget
use `log_compute` or smthg similar to follow what's going on, and maybe you can try to split up things or reduce computing by not doing operation on floats etc
or can it be somehow achieved in one function call from the Web3 frontend?
i'm giving it burn_instruction,create_token_associated_account and then trasnfer_instruction in one call?? is there a better way to do this??
There is a ceiling of compute unit a program can use per run. It must fall below 200k else it's being terminated. You'r being terminated in that case
Check serum/Anchor repository, tests folder. Plenty examples there
An account made transfered token to himself, and have 2 adresses for the same mint. One with balance 0 (that shows in explorer and wallet) and one with the actual token, balance 1, that doesn't show. Did the user lost his token, or just need to delete the first token account to have the other one appear as the main one?
hey folks! hope it's not a dumb question here:

i'm pretty new to Solana but have some experience with solidity. So far from all the tutorials im seeing minting NFTs and tokens through the CLI tool. Not seeing any examples around how to attach artwork to NFTs! Does anyone have examples around that? What's the usually tooling for building NFT projects on SOL? Have anyone tried to implement any non-standard royalty structures?

Same goes for minting utility tokens. Would love to see examples of utility tokens being issued and used through the smart contract! 

Thanks a ton!

What does this error mean to say?? Cant quite understand
Never mind I think I got this. Looks like i need to query the associated token address directly instead of the owner (SOL) address. For example, if I want to monitor the USDC flow of an account I need to query everything on the USDC account not the owner's account.
Quick question: How can I retrieve all the transactions by querying an address that is only the recipient of several token transfers but not the signer?

Depending on the website, you could check out holaplex https://www.holaplex.com/. Also, plenty of docs for Metaplex here https://docs.metaplex.com/
That's an auxilliary account. aux accounts are non-associated token accounts, which is to say, non-canonical. It is recommended to use associated token accounts instead.

Still trying to wrap my head around this. So would the proper protocol be to create a `multisig` token account and then use offline transactions to sign the account? Would this make it possible to only withdraw Solana from the account if all three members sign?
looking at pricing plans on quicknode, what would a method call be? is that each time someone attempts to mint?

I think solana RPC api wouldn't have such a big issue with rate limits if the docs gave more examples on how to run your own node.
üëç
Most likely. Depends. As I‚Äôve said many time, if you‚Äôre receiving this then you need to run your own RPC anyways
just curious: if you receive too many HTTP 429 error will you get permanently banned?
Oh I see
Because of too much abuse
Because mainnet beta is not made for NFT drops and they are completely blocked now
but I don't understand why mainnet had blocked our website 4 days after we minted 100 nft and it was like 1 NFT/2 minutes
alright thank you!
It‚Äôs RPC as a service
Figment, runnodes, quicknode to name a few
They do it for you.
is the setup easy & fast to switch from mainnet beta to a new RPC?
Likely the same as mainnet beta.
If you don‚Äôt wanna worry about it then use one of the many RPC services available
what's the rate limit in Mainnet beta rpc?
If you don‚Äôt want rate limited then run an RPC node
Depending on your node version, textencoder may not be global. Textencoder was added in node14 to global, which is what is supported
Mainnet beta rpc is not for your NFT drops people
http://api.metaplex.solana.com/
our website was blocked 3 days after the mint and there was no minting activity
Not all, but most of them get blocked if they don't. Leads to a bad UX
hi guys do all 10k NFTs collections get a paid RPC?
our website was blocked after we've only done 100 mints
Also genesysgo. A quick Google search will give a few competitors
I think You can check out quicknodes.
How can i get a paid rpc ?
It always depends on the traffic and amount of requests. Large audience and high traffic? Get a paid rpc for the mint. Doing it yourself over a long time? Should be fine
Nice! This could really come in handy.
Code is found here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/explorer
Quick question: I'm using WSL Ubuntu and set up an Anchor project. It builds fine, but my tests with Mocha are failing (default project have not changed anything) with the following error: "ReferenceError: TextEncoder is not defined at Function.fromSecretKey (/mnt/c/users/<user>/<folder>/<project_folder>/node_modules/@solana/web3.js/lib/index.cjs.js:5693:23)" has anyone else encountered this?
Just to follow-up, I just found explorer.solana.com also contains this information. I think I'll dig a bit more into this and try to collect as much info as possible.
?
Can i rely on this rpc to mint 3k NFTs
Thank u very much u saved my day
the only other option is to have your own RPC, and there are plenty of services that provide them
for NFT specific things
http://api.metaplex.solana.com/
but this is available
got it
basically anything NFT related stuff is blocked from mainnet beta now to do NFT drop abuse
try cURLing your request, theres no CORS in cURL. if it still dont work, its not CORS. Sometimes (dont know why) chrome throws cors errors for errors which arent cors
OK thanks!
http://api.metaplex.solana.com/
you can try the meatplex public RPC but if you abuse it you will get ratelimited here as well
I do not know of any public one at this time. Solscan could help you move the process along though
https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints#mainnet-beta
yes
Oh cool. Is there a database or similar resources where I can get a vague idea of what instructions corresponds to which activity?
I use the candy machine mint app is that the problem
I suspect they do a lot of work labeling instructions and keep a full map on their side
Solscan identifies a lot of transaction instructions beforehand and labels them based on the common instruction. You could do this yourself by labeling the instruction based on what it is doing
it's likely you were abusing a public RPC and have now been blocked. blocking was implemented a few weeks ago due to abuse by too many people. if you are building an app that needs to scale then you need your own RPC node
Hi,

I was able to use `getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2` and `getConfirmedTransaction` API calls to retrieve all the transactions from an account.

I would like to get more details about each transaction. I noticed on Solscan.io you can actually see what each transaction is about, like the figure below.

How can I retrieve similar info with the JSON RPC API calls?

Thanks in advance.
Or to make sure its blocked
Do u know to resolve this issue
probably better in <#560174212967432193>
most likely if it had worked previously

Hi guys
??
It is possible that my domain get blocked
Hi i get cors policy error when calling explorer-api.solana.com
Sure. Import `bs58` and `web3`, then 
`let keypair = web3.Keypair.fromSecretKey(bs58.decode(phantomExportedKeyString));`
mind throwing the working code snippet in here for others to see?
it worked, thanks!, I only needed to decode bs58, no `TextEncoder.encode` before throw on `keypair.fromSecretKey`
When calling  
  var fromWallet = solanaWeb3.Keypair.generate(); in React Native app getting  Error: no PRNG   at the following  var randombytes = function(/* x, n */) { throw new Error('no PRNG'); };

var _0 = new Uint8Array(16);
var _9 = new Uint8Array(32); _9[0] = 9;  in node_modules\tweetnacl\nacl-fast.js
paper wallet*
`console.log(enc.encode(bs58.decode(pvk).toString("hex")));`
at least it returns me 128 bytes which are multiple of 64 lol
can i log in my file system wallet from phantom wallet? I am trying recovery worrds but it connecting another wallet ?
using spl-token cli when we try to transfer a token to a paper wallet address it asks us to add the --funded-recipient flag... i checked up the transaction on it but couldn't quite understand what's going on there? can anyone please explain it a bit?
yes, Im investigatin here, the privatekey's Uint8array must be 64 bytes long, for some reason mine is returing 87 bytes long
make sure you're doing the proper conversion the key from phantom is a ed25519 keypair, base58 encoded
This is not right since borsh includes the variant as the first byte, this works even with the same arguments 

```rust
pub enum GreetingInstruction {
    InitGreeting(InitGreetingArgs),
    InitGreeting2(InitGreetingArgs),
}
```
Got it
i'm using the two paper wallets and calling the program using the one who is sending the spl-token to another account
signer privilege escalated", what does this error mean?
its a string exported from phantom "Export private key" option. If I do `Keypair.fromSecretKey`, it asks for a `Uint8Array`. Fine, went to google trying to convert to said format. Found `TextEncoder` and now it throws `bad secret key size`
what format is the private key string you're trying to convert?

HI there i hope youre doing well, i have a question about solana beach..So our token has verified already but when i click on view token button on solana beach network  it shows en error like 404 Not Found ...Anyone can help????
Looked at this answer again and I think i have got what I need to do!!!
Hello. I just (almost) finished writing a dapp called Instaplex which is the first "on-demand" NFT generation & mint on Solana. It's build on top of Metaplex protocol. Like currently all the art is "pre- generated" and the buyer simply mints/buys an artwork. Within Instaplex, the art is generated on-demand, so the creator or the buyer doesn't know what someone is getting. It's a revolutionary way to build more programmable NFTs and generative artworks. I would love to connect to Solana or Metaplex folks here, and discuss the future of the project. I am also looking at fellow developers/testers who can help contribute on this.
Guys do you know how can I get mint hashes from a candy machine?
<@!813810767605661761> Thanks ^^ it is working now üòÑ
If you're writing your front end in typescript then you can use the values you just described to find the account on which the metadata is stored with a function like this:
```
  export async function getMetadata(
    tokenMint: string,
  ): Promise<string> {
  
    return (
      await findProgramAddress(
        [
          Buffer.from("metadata"),
          (new PublicKey("metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s")).toBuffer(),
          (new PublicKey(tokenMint)).toBuffer(),
        ],
        new PublicKey("metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s"),
      )
    )[0];
  }
```

Then you'll need `connection.getAccountInfo(metadataKey)` using the key for the account you just got

Then you'll need to decode the data on that account info. The best way to work out how to do that is probably to check the metaplex repo and copy how they're doing it there.
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/ed453c433b651c5c7e9e59b9bb1f67fbac788265/js/packages/common/src/actions/metadata.ts#L454
Hi, may I know how long should it take to sync up with archive nodes and full nodes on Solana?
if anyone wants to create their own, this is an open source world, so it would be welcomed by all
metaplex has only existed for like 3 months. they are building tools for everyone to use. expecting this experience to be perfect is a little ridiculous. just like everything so far with solana, it will improve.
I think the team is just overwhelmed by pressure to deliver. So many projects rushing into the space rn. Might be worth it to say something in office hours.
Hey guys, I am trying to build a little nft gallery just for myself to try out the solana infrastructure.
Stumbled upon this, and wanted to know if this is still needed to display ur own spl tokens.

```
You'll need a few things to generate the PDA. The first is an array of "seeds," which includes:

The Metaplex seed constant: metadata
The metadata public key: metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s
The NFT token account mint address, which is also returned from the RPC call.
With that seed data, you can perform the findProgramAddress operation and that will result in a PDA account/address. Both data items 2 and 3 need to be Base58 encoded.
```

So my application connects to the phantom wallet correctly, I already get all the tokens of my wallet.
The only problem I am trying to figure out since some hours is how to request the metadata of each token,
I am either doing something wrong with `findProgramAddress` or with the properties I am passing into the function,
might've something to do with the way I buffer the values or the base58 encoding.
I am not a native speaker so I had quite a hard time reading the guide I stumbled upon, might be missing something.
Hello. I'm trying to interact with the metadata program on my local chain. By default the metadata program is not there but from the documentation it looks like I should be able to clone the metadata program by running "solana-test-validator --clone metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s --url https://api.devnet.solana.com/"
But that doesn't seem to work.
Is there something I'm doign wrong? Is it possible to interact with the metadata program on a local chain?
if you write a script you'll need to do it in a way that takes this into account
https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints#mainnet-beta
yes there's a rate limit for the public rpc node, which is what that command uses, a couple hundred ms delay should be fine
not on chain, you can create your own pseudorandom number generator, which can be very simple or complex depending on your usecase. otherwise, they are working on creating vrf at some point for on chain rng
Incorrect program ID for instruction

I‚Äôm getting this error
Hey guys! I'm experimenting with the name services and i want to know how i could obtain the details of a particular website.

As in, if the website i provide is `hola.sol` 
i want to retrieve the information regarding it (owner etc.)

So far i've come up with:-
```js
const baseAccount = anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();
    const opts = {
      preflightCommitment: "processed"
    };
    const network = "http://hi.sol";
    const connection = new anchor.web3.Connection(network, opts.preflightCommitment);
    const pubKey = baseAccount.publicKey;
    const nameOwner = await solNameService.getNameOwner(connection,pubKey);
    console.log(nameOwner);```
Or some way of achieving a random number within a given range?
Does Solana have a random number oracle?
Hi guys can anyone send me the presale program github link?

Greting accoutn this struct
```
#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
pub struct GreetingAccount {
    pub public_key: String,
}
```
so I have created instance of it `GreetingAccount{ public_key: "test".to_string()}`
How are you initializing the account and what does greeting_account look like
Well if metaplex refuses to clean up their docs then Solana should fork the docs (and possibly the project) and put it on their site, since it is such an integral part of NFTs.
can anybody help me with this?
hi 
below is my account debug.
```
AccountInfo { key: EfHAcHyFNwQppS45yon9uCfHaZzJ37zJdMs3PojLC9rw owner: 7pgyKnsP438pDmaawuFQAHPhkgN15YngzVJ6doLNMfij is_signer: false is_writable: true executable: false rent_epoch: 0 lamports: 918720 data.len: 4  data: 00000000 ... }
```
here data.len is only 4
so when I serialize my struct to `account.data` only 4 elements of slice are changing. but I have 134 data length to be saved.
This is how I am serializing data to account where `greeting_account` is vector of 134 length and `writer` is 4 len
```
    let mut data = &mut *account.data.borrow_mut();
    let mut writer = &mut data[..];
    let encoded = bincode::serialize_into(writer, &greeting_account);
```
NFT Metadata is not part of Solana core and a third party project, I don‚Äôt think it should be part of the solana core docs

Better to get https://docs.metaplex.com more cleaned up
Man I fully agree. I am very critical towards metaplex because of crap like this and really hope that the Solana core team comes up with a better standard. 
Working with metaplex was nothing but frustrating if you want to do anything yourself like only using the metadata program
Hello everyone,
Does anyone have a trick to get the public key of mint contracts for NFT collections?
<@!137101040687382528> <@!195044797134798848> What would be the right way to get the steps to fetch metadata into the solana docs (https://docs.solana.com/developing) ?
Oh that's awesome thanks I'll give it a go! It was driving me crazy haha. I 100% agree, getting started with Metaplex has been such a frustrating experience yet there's no alternative because almost all wallets/marketplace use their PDA convention.
Thanks, but I was hoping for a nice datagram like this.
can I list my nft holders?
<@630375665442488339>
That‚Äôs what I mean with metaplex just wants you to clone their repo and use that as is (like candymachine, which feels like ‚Äòjust use it, dont try to understand it‚Äô). I think the entire dev experience around it is very poor and frustrating
I had the same issue. If you use the metadata program from crates, that‚Äôs buggy and doesn‚Äôt work. It doesn‚Äôt mark the payer correctly as writable
Update your Cargo file to use the github master

I created an issue about this already on metaplex github and brought it up in their discord, but they don‚Äôt react
Oh wait I know exactly what this bug is
Thanks for replying! Sadly no, I'm giving the same account 3 times (the same user as different authorities) but the called instruction properly expects one of them to be a writable account. The called instruction is `create_metadata_accounts` from Metaplex btw (using a local build to test on localnet).
The metaplex borsch can be found in the client code
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/js/packages/common/src/actions/metadata.ts
You can use the same account for multiple things afaik. Could be that he‚Äôs not marked as writable for payer?
Ah I misread the question
Probably a missing signer or some acc not writeable
The address is a Program Derived Address. You can read about it at https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs
how can i transfer a wrapped SOL Token??  when i try to do so it gives an error Account could not be parsed as token account: pubkey=8ZW8gQ4iVQcQmZSFqs4QZMrQsfaeAB9AmFHyH15w714R
Hi all üëã  Any idea what could cause write privilege to be lost during a CPI?
Thanks Kartik , I think i need get address's Label by local node,  third api has rate limit
gm all. I'm trying to use the explorer code as a base to create some tx info tools and keep getting TS errors. I was wondering if anyone has managed to build it.
OK, so they do have an API:
https://github.com/solana-beach/api

> At Solana Beach, we are convinced that sharing is caring. We want to help anyone building on Solana to best leverage network data for their projects. Therefore, we are providing limited API access to developers free of charge. In order to have a structured way of onboarding builders to using our API, we need anyone looking for an API key to follow these simple steps:
> 
> Fill out this TypeForm
> Sit back and enjoy some time at the ‚ÄôBeach until we get back to you
> Build an awesome product üôÇ
Not sure if you can (should) use it though.
But the Solana Beach frontend gets it's data from this API call:
```console
> curl "https://prod-api.solana.surf/v1/account/TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"

{
  "type": "unknown",
  "value": {
    "base": {
      "address": {
        "name": "SPL Token Program",
        "address": "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"
      },
      "balance": 1089991680,
      "executable": true,
      "owner": {
        "name": "BPF Loader 2",

      "rentExemptReserve": 1089991680
    },
    "extended": {}
  }
}
```
Nope, it returns `Internal server error`
How about this address: `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`
solbulls.art seems to use this API, which greatly simplifies things.
https://api-mainnet.magiceden.io/rpc/getNFTByMintAddress/Ba3zHubWfSw6bMmgWbng93aCVN3Akfd1Uwug7d5LLRsZ
Hi team, how get address' Label, like:
Exactly but is there a github repo where I can look for further information or any type of website indicating more details?
If my understanding is correct, there is nothing special about a breedable NFT.
All you need is an (on-chain) program that will take in two (or more) (or even just one) and creates new NFTs based on the inputs.
Hi guys is there any info about how to make breedable NFTs?
It is best practice to document algorithms in a language-agnostic manner.
Will anyone mind if I re-write https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#hash-based-generated-program-addresses in pseudocode?
Oh yes, that is definitely very helpful üôÇ
<https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/5197d1bf3a6ce41c9e8b5e9b058ed244d8685aaf/src/publickey.ts#L171-L191>
the js library has it implemented in js if that helps
I'll go brush up on rust.
Although there is a reason algorithms are written in pseudocode.
Thanks, that is very helpful.
PDAs are documented here <https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses>
In etherium or solidity, when we want a function to recieve we make it payable and set the amount to a specifc range and if the user sends that only then does that function work... what is the equivalent of a payble fucntion in solana??
that's documented here: <https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard#token-metadata-program> (the "PDA" section)
https://docs.rs/spl-token-metadata/0.0.1/spl_token_metadata/instruction/enum.MetadataInstruction.html#variant.CreateMetadataAccount found it

But metaplex is a very bad example because their documentation is basically non existent
I was honestly expecting something like:
https://github.com/near/borsh#specification
And what about Solana's PublicKeys?
They had documented somewhere how to derive the metadata account for a mint
<@!137101040687382528> I was going though your gist, and most of it seems arbitrary.
From what I understand, given a Solana address, `A`, the metadata for that address is stored at the location `M`, which is derived from a combination of `A`, `METADATA_PROGRAM_ID`, `METADATA_PREFIX` and arcane maths.
I assume this is also undocumented by Metaplex?
and i do that through the command line with solana package? or a different package
If you call that you can set things like name, url, etc
You have to use the metadata programs `createMetadataAccounts` method
<@!137101040687382528> how does one "push" to the metaplex? i see the formats listing attributes and whatnot but i'm not sure how to use it or make it
with a "list" of parseable program data being this: <https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/9847566654b0871f2eed120569ae48d998102153/account-decoder/src/parse_account_data.rs#L24-L36>
(the decoding happens on the node side, not inside the library as far as i can tell)
they're not documented afaik, i think they're here: <https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/account-decoder/src>
Register it with metaplex https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard
i have a really dumb question, but does anyone have a good resource for how people actually bind images or whatever to a created NFT? maybe good youtube videos? having a hard time grasping some stuff
Where can I find those?
And what about the hardcoded formats?
it's not documented because metaplex hasn't documented it. solana has everything documented to the point where you need to decode the data with base64, but after that solana doesn't know what the data is
the data is binary encoded via base64. you have to first decode the string with base64, then decode the binary data via Borsh according to metaplex's account format
Preferably on the APIs page.
Again, why is all this not documented somewhere?
parsed info only exists for a few specific account types, which have the decoding rules hardcoded into the library. metaplex isn't one of them so you'll have to decode the data yourself
How does `AAAAAJuVac9OTEGaJ1Vxqj9ykBrYmHhaowshkkO7hUHr8PRSAQAAAAAAAAAAAQEAAACblWnPTkxBmidVcao/cpAa2Jh4WqMLIZJDu4VB6/D0Ug==` become json? Is that something only https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com knows?

Good day. Is there any reentry attacks in rust solana as it is in Solidity Ethereum? Should i care about them and put something like nonReentrant modifier?

Yes
ah wait you meant the rpc format
OK, I found a SolBull https://solbulls.art/#/bull/Ba3zHubWfSw6bMmgWbng93aCVN3Akfd1Uwug7d5LLRsZ
but again, the format depends on the program. you can write whatever into the account data that you want
yeah that would be nice but unfortunately we're not so lucky
Here, every answer seems to be "use `@solana/web3.js`"
Yes, but if those formats are meant to be use by integrations there there is at least some effort to document the format.
kinda like how some apps store their state in proprietary files on your pc, or some services use something like grpc for transport that you can't decode without knowing the data schema
it's up to the project. by default everything is closed source and very lowlevel
the data is this account https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/ed453c433b651c5c7e9e59b9bb1f67fbac788265/rust/token-metadata/program/src/state.rs#L88-L99 encoded via Borsh, there's no better documentation i know of
Like a url or something?
Then shouldn't the standard allow a pointer to a schema.
base64 is just used for transportation to http
.data is just a blob of data, there is no official way to decode it because it purely depends on how the program encoded the data
Even for the common types.
The JSON RPC api doesn't contain anything about how data is base64 encoded.
For solana as well.
(metaplex !== solana. it's a project on solana for nfts)
they seem to prefer that people just github clone their code and use that
for metaplex? They aren't the aren't very good with documentation imo üò∂ I had the same frustration when I wanted to integrate with them
Source code doesn't count as documentation.
Right, but is there any official documentation not in source code?
checkout the gist I sent. I copied that together from the metaplex github repo. 
This line here describes the schema - https://gist.github.com/dvcrn/c099c9b5a095ffe4ddb6481c22cde5f4#file-metadata-ts-L175-L188
No technical documentation, nothing.
I for the life of me could not find any documentation on the binary formats that solana uses.
Is the format documented anywhere?
Hmm.
metaplexs metadata program
metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s is the program that owns this account. it's the address of the metadata program
Oh so `metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s` is hardcoded?
check this gist out, https://gist.github.com/dvcrn/c099c9b5a095ffe4ddb6481c22cde5f4
>       "owner": "metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s",
Oh yes it's metadata, whoops missed that
Sorry, this is my first time working with crypto as a whole.
So it‚Äôs some nft. Is it metaplex metadata? Decoding metaplex data is documented
Looks like SolBull is from https://solbulls.art/
Well blindly decoding the base64 data gives something.

What kind of account is this? 
Something proprietary/closed source or from something like the spl token program
Solana's?
Which source code?
You need access to the source code or check with the project docs if they specify it
> you need to know the data shape/scheme of the account
OK, and how do I get that information?
https://github.com/near/borsh-js
You need to know how it got serialized. In Solana most of the time that‚Äôs borsh, but to decode with borsh you need to know the data shape/scheme of the account
Yeah, the data blob is the data the account stores. Now you need to decode it üòÑ
My question is how do I make sense of `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` ?

Yeah you can look at the .data attribute of an account
True, but on a PC, I can run `file <filename>` to get at least a decent idea of what kind of file it is.
The docs mention this too but imagine an account to be like a file on a pc. You write bytes into it and you can read bytes out 
But without knowing how the writing site serialized something into this byte blob you won‚Äôt be able to do much
accounts have some base information, than can hold many kinds of data, that can be customized.  so yes, to decode certain data, you may need to know more in depth information about the account.
`walletarr[i].push(...);` will call a function called `push` on `walletarr[i]`.
The syntax to write values into an array is `walletarr[i] = <value>`
what do you mean by writing into the array index directly?? walletarr[i] doesn't it mean i'm telling it to write a values in it's i'th index?
oh okay i got what you mean....an array of size[Pubkey:3200] doesn't it mean that it will have 3200 indexes?? specifying 3200 does mean 3200 indexes? so if i pass a pubkey on it's index 1 shouldn't it accept it.....
I tried to do something similar with around double of the amount of addresses you have and the rent cost for the account was around 2 SOL ($300)
You gotta write into the array index directly 
But keep in mind that there are storage limitations. One pubkey is 32 bytes and a pda can only store 10kb. Might need to use a normal account for this
Also, the method is literally called `getAccountInfo`
So you need information about the account to get information about the account?
go learn some more rust! from the rust resources üôÇ   traditional arrays are fixed len at compile time
but array of pubkey doesn't support push() function
Can I do that with the JSON RPC api?
let(wallet_addresses,_none) =array_refs![src,3200,1];
        let walletarr :[Pubkey;3200];
        
        for i in 0..walletarr.len() {
            if i==0{
                let(test,check)=wallet_addresses.split_at(32);
                walletarr[i].push(unpack_pubkey(test)?);
i'm trying to do something like this.......
It‚Äôs still feasible but 2.5 SOL for each upgrade üòÖ
data in account info can vary based on the type of data stored in the account.  its best to know what type of account data, in order to properly deserialize it.
Hey guys, partial program upgrades aren‚Äôt a thing right? 
We hit a point where deploying costs 2.5 SOL ish, and a lot of functionality is behind PDAs that we can‚Äôt migrate to smaller programs
so a Vec like above may work, alternatively a different approach: https://github.com/hashblock/solana-cli-program-template/blob/main/program/src/account_state.rs you can store however you like, anchor framework also makes these types of things easy.
Or is this the right channel?

if you mean from a client like web3 you can call getAccountInfo:
`const account = await connection.getAccountInfo(pubKey);`
otherwise, you pass the accounts from the client to the program. if you want account info inside the program, you want you should be passing those accounts from the client.

Hi guys. Could anyone point me to a resource/tutorial for a program that saves and retrieves an object on the blockchain?

I want to save an object and I'm struggling with that.

PS: I'm a developer new to solana
hey does any body know how can i create an array in the state.rs file inside a structure?  sorry didn't mean to tag you!!
plz
help me
how can i get accountinfo by pubkey in program??
Hi everyone!
I am planning to launch my cool nft collection, which is ready. I am really excited about this, however, i am new to blockchain developing side. So, I need help/ guidance.

1.Can someone tell me how do I mint my nft on solana and put it on blockchain?
2. What apps can be useful in this regard?
3. Which coding will be required? Any coding template of already launched nft projects?
4.Essentially how do I proceed from here?
Good morning everyone, I'm looking for docs around migrating from base58 addresses to base64 addresses. Any resources to point me to ? Thanks !
it's a local chain running inside docker that's completely fresh, the deploy script automatically airdrops sol, and i airdrop before running the command line
you can try 
`solana program deploy your_new_program.so --program-id your-origin-program-id`
and there are something you need to check before you execute
1. check the update authority is matching
2. check your origin program is upgradable
3. check your payer has enough sol
for more info you can use `solana program deploy --help`
if i try to deploy it via command line, i get 
> Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x1
i'm trying to deploy a program via the web3.js library. it worked fine last month but now all of a sudden it doesn't. i've tried different versions of the web3 library and different versions of solana
Does anyone know what causes this error:
> Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 1: invalid account data for instruction

There are some misunderstands
1. basically, we don‚Äôt call the account which you used as PDA, PDA is a off-curve (ed25519) and calculated by seed + program id
2. Account‚Äôs owner can only change when it is 1) all zero bytes and  2) use origin program to change

for you qn.
after you init account in token program, it can‚Äôt be transferred owner back because Its data bytes not all zero
<@!788215642070581289> i think we should assign token program(TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA) to the pda 

Also after that i want to initialize the account and want to make my program id as owner
saving
i tried assigning pda to token prgram address and my program address
is there something i am missing
this error happened when program try to modify account data which the account doesn't belong to it. (the account's owner isn't the current program)
for SOL balance, you use https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/get-sol-balance/main.en.ts
for token balance you use https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/get-token-balance/main.en.ts
if you don't know your token address you can use https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/advanced/token/get-all-token-account-by-owner/main.en.ts#L10
or if your token address is ATA you can use 
https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/create-token-account/main.en.ts#L62
Hi , I have 100 USDC and 1 FTT in wallet.But when I run ```connection.getAccountInfo(public_key)``` I cannot  see these tokens. On data field , the response is ```data: <Buffer >,``` what is wrong?? I can see correct SOL balance, But I cannot see token balance
now i get this error <@!788215642070581289>     '
failed to verify account {{PDA_address}}: instruction modified data of an account it does not own',
seems you use many your custom function, I can't see them clearly.
but the main idea is that if your mint auth is a multisig account,
1. pass the multisig pubkey to mint authority
2. pass the real signer pubkeys in to array.
3. pass all signer when you send
you can take a look here https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/mint-to/main.en.ts#L15-L23
transaction.add( createTokenInitIX(mintKey.publicKey), createTokenAccountIX(newAccount.publicKey, mintKey.publicKey),await mintTo(newAccount.publicKey,payerAccount,[],1,mintKey.publicKey))
   
 await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [payerAccount, mintKey, newAccount])
 
after creating token and its account and calling the mint to instrcution when i check the transaction on solana explorer it shows the payer account as multisigner with only the address of the payerAccount as the signer what's up with that? and i'm also passing the payer account as the signer in the keys...
if you want to init a token account , the token account size should be 165 bytes
can anyone help me identify error here
if it is a WSOL account. it is a token account
so you use token transfer method to transfer wsol
<@!785084693023424542> Yes, but that doesn't work every time.

Whats the account limit that `getProgramAccounts` can handle? It currently returns 100k+ accounts for our use case and takes 20+ seconds. Curious if `getProgramAccounts` will be able to handle 1M accounts and beyond. Anyone have any idea?

I actually was looking for how to parse the returned base64 into JSON.
Super helpful. Thank you so much!
Guys can i access nft's token address which was uploaded from me?
yep, 10MB is max. `solana rent <account-size>` will tell you how much it would cost to make the account rent-exempt.
Or do you just have to have enough to make it rent exempt and there's no further cost up to the max size?
10 MB is the max limit for account size, right? Is there a calculator that determines how much it costs for x bytes in an account?
exactly.  you'd load that whitelist into an account with one or more transactions to your program
So any sort of whitelist that could be read by a program would need to be stored in an account.
Yeah, makes sense.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64
nope, no network access from a program.  imagine if 1000+ validators attempted to all access Arweave at the same time to run that transaction, and then some failed.
Can Solana programs call external resources? E.g. fetch a JSON file from Arweave to use the data.
Hi,
I can't seem to find the specification for the base64 encoding of the [JSON RPC api](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#json-rpc-api-reference)
Ah, my mistake. Sounds like the memo program is exactly what I'm looking for, thanks!
>  I don't actually need the data recorded on-chain
Memo program doesn't store any data on-chain.  The transaction is included in the ledger of course, but there's no on-chain account required for a memo
That seemed like the closest to what I want, though I don't actually need the data recorded on-chain
The memo program seems like it would be a good choice for this: https://spl.solana.com/memo
Goal is for a server to provide a random nonce to include in the transaction to prove that the client it is talking to is the one who signed the transaction
Anybody know if it's possible to include extra data in a transaction that will be ignored by the validator?
Awesome, thank you so much! Appreciate the help
close the account
Thanks for the answer Hana. I am able to create the account qnd send it wrapped Sol. But how do you withdraw into the main account?
its actually pretty cool, i figured it out not long after. you create a native mint token account. and then after, "wrapping" and "unwrapping" are kind of bad metaphors maybe, its more like strict correlation. if you send sol to your token account, it mints more token to match. if you send tokens, it sends the sol with it. and if you withdraw the underlying sol it burns corresponding tokens
Thanks for the answer üôÇ
That doesn't sound like it would be a problem
Hey üôÇ
I will soon release my application to the devnet for people to test. This one requires my server to send a transaction lets say every 4sec. Given that the devnet sol are free, will this be considered as spam by the cluster ? If yes i will change strategy.
Yes of course it just depends on your implementation and who has authority.

Hi everyone, a related question to one asked by <@!811633301747531786> before: how can I unwrap wrapped SOL?

-When I try to unwrap using Token program, I run into ‚Äúinvalid account data for instruction‚Äù error.
-When I try to unwrap using the System program, I run into a signature verification error which seems unlikely.

Am I doing something wrong or is there another way to unwrap?

Would really appreciate some guidance!
anyone know how i can deploy my candy machine onto netlify?

what outputs logMessages in solana? is it a program's instructions? do they omit automatically in each tx or do they have to be specified in a program's code somewhere?
That's the recommended way. Not existing at this time.
how can I (not so serious) random number in rust contract? do `Chainlink VRF` style is only way?
also is the token account program what creates new versions of tokens? like on devnet does `ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL` create token accounts?
correct you are ser it was bc I used old getTransaction() method
so doing it one time should be fine rite? Thanks a lot
It's just memoizing your config and making REST calls
Hey everyone, am creating connection in my server using new Connection(rpcUrl, 'confirmed');
How long does this connection last? or how often should i establish this connection?
Sounds like bugs.  Are you using the most recent release?
lul wtf
`Error: Using Connection with default commitment: 'confirmed', but method requires at least 'confirmed'`
anyone get this with web3?
How can I send multiple tx at once using the  https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter ? The sendTransaction function seems to only allow 1 tx at once? Help appreciated!

workaround: ask wallet users to add your site to trusted apps (autoapprove)
usually i'd just transfer the remaining address lamports and the runtime wipes it, but that isn't working either
Hey everyone. To test our protocol on test/devnet, we need a usdc faucet. I know about this one: https://usdcfaucet.com/. The problem is that it only allows 5usdc per IP. Is there a way to issue more usdc at a time? Thx!
every time i try to redeploy to the same program id it just says `XXXX has been closed, use a new Program Id`
Yes I think
is it possible to reuse a program address that you closed?
Hey our contract has an authority we don't recognize and we can't access it anymore, what should we do üò¶ We have its private key though
Actually found my answer, I can force it to be signed and force that signer to be on the ed25519 curve

Hi, How can I get the transaction of my NFT collection from other market places?
When retrieving program accounts for the stake program with base64 encoding how is the decoding done? I'm decoding base64 in python and I am left with a byte array. Am I suppose to reencode base58 to get the account data?
The `AccountInfo` method `data_is_empty` unfortunately only tests if the data length is 0
Is there a simple way of testing if the account data is empty/blank? Or do I have to test if every data byte == 0? (on-chain program)
Hello, I have a website and I want to check if a user has a specific token on his wallet, how can I do?
Any solana develope who has worked on an nft project
I think you can do similar things by yourself,
calculate ATA https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/create-token-account/main.en.ts#L62
and check is it initialized,
if don't you create a create ATA tx and request wallet to sign it.
https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/create-token-account/main.en.ts#L70-L83
above code don't contain wallet sign, but you can take a look for those under layer things
is there any way to use `getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo` in that case?
I don't think you can get a private key from wallet adapter but you can request them to sign tx
i.e. for a connected wallet
can i do this using the wallet adapter?
if you are using phantom, you can export private key or mnemonic phrase
It seems I can use u32 instead, and use f32::to_bits and f32::from bits to convert between the two types
can I get a Keypair from a Wallet? I am trying to execute `getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo`
not sure what you want to do but I give you some points
1. PDA is an off-chain address which derived by seed + program id. only program can sign (via invoke_signed)
2. you need to pass all accounts you need in tx so that program can use it

so for your qn, to disallow program signed accounts
if program is yours, you just don't call `invoke_signed` that your program will not sign any PDA
if program is not yours, you don't pass PDA to it so that program cannot use it (but if so, your tx may failed because the program logic just need the PDA, I don't think you can disallow not yours program to do something)
you can take a look at this transfer SOL example
https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/transfer/main.en.ts
I'm unfamiliar with crypto--is there a way to disallow program signed accounts? i.e. force that an account is signed with a private key and is not a PDA
hey, trying to update our project description but running into some weird issues with the linter https://github.com/solana-labs/ecosystem/pull/470

Aye
It's just a price book. Each price has a set of offers (at that price) that are saved in the account pointed by the pubkey. But don't worry, I don't think it might be difficult to fix this issue
Thanks, almost sure that's the problem. My mistake then. I need keys to be f32, I will have to see how to counter this. Thanks
But I don't know what you are trying to accomplish
So you'll have to change your key
This works
```rust
let faux_map = BTreeMap::<String, f32>::new();
```
I think that may be coming out of the BTreeMap and not Borsh
```rust
let faux_map = BTreeMap::<f32, String>::new();
the trait bound `f32: std::cmp::Ord` is not satisfied
the trait `std::cmp::Ord` is not implemented for `f32`rustcE0277
map.rs(490, 5): required by `std::collections::BTreeMap::<K, V>::new`
```
did you end up finding a solution to your problem? Stuck at them same thingy rn

Hi all, I am trying to figure out if there is a way to identify if any NFT was created on my platform that lets you mint NFTs. One way I thought of was attaching an simple ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù smart contract and see if that is attached to the NFT. Is that the right approach or am I way off?
I don't know what this means "this error originates in a derive macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)"
oh should i read the error's note
get this error
Price is f32


Can you post the structure with the f32?
0.9.1
borsh = "^0"
borsh-derive = "^0"
In borsh... what version are you using?
I have these
No, I am referring to rust. Maybe I am missing some crate? Where's that macro?
It's just a security issue, because the client can always change the account order. Thanks for the ideas. I should probably just use anchor, but I am lazy to learn it.
It's there
```rust
// Note NaNs have a portability issue. Specifically, signalling NaNs on MIPS are quiet NaNs on x86,
// and vice-versa. We disallow NaNs to avoid this issue.
macro_rules! impl_for_float {
    ($type: ident) => {
        impl BorshSerialize for $type {
            #[inline]
            fn serialize<W: Write>(&self, writer: &mut W) -> Result<()> {
                assert!(
                    !self.is_nan(),
                    "For portability reasons we do not allow to serialize NaNs."
                );
                writer.write_all(&self.to_bits().to_le_bytes())
            }
        }
    };
}

impl_for_float!(f32);
impl_for_float!(f64);
```
Are you referring to JS?
a tx has size limit (1232 byte)
a tx contains those information
```
signatre 64byte
account 32byte
your instruction ?? byte
```
so the maximum number of accounts depends on your tx's structure.
I think in most situations 30~40 is very close the max
You don‚Äôt need to write types to your data I think.
Take an example. You have Struct X, Struct Y in your program.
You decide the instruction account order so you can choose the correct deserialization for them
Unfortunately if your Struct X and Struct Y has the same data length and you can‚Äôt recognize them correctly
You can add extra bytes to represent struct type like anchor do (hash struct name and take first 8 bytes)
How can I use f32 with Borsch? I am getting "the trait `Ord` is not implemented for `f32`"
Or rather, AccountInfos
What's the maximum number of accounts that can be passed to a program?
It seems that neither Borsch nor Bincode write explicitly the data type when serializing. My programs owns several instances of different types of structs, each in its own account. How can the program trust that an account data is supposed to be deserialized into some particular type? It might be unlikely that some serialized value of type A can be deserialized into a value of type B, but it's not impossible (e.g., u32 and f32). How do I make sure that that does not happen? Should I use a different serialization/deserialization library which explicitly writes down the data type in the account data?
link seems to be dead (or I don't have access). Is anyone aware of an existing framework for editing token 'trait' metadata post-mint?
Alright ! I need to dig in this code then, thanks again man you're a life saver !
what rpc method you used when you got the error?
I guess you use getXXXXXXX method and rpc response error.
if yes, you need to specify encoding attribute when you do rpc call. like here
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getaccountinfo
when you do `getAccountInfo`
you pass a base58 address to fetch its data like this
```
curl http://localhost:8899 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getAccountInfo",
    "params": [
      "your bs58 address here"
    ]
  }
'
```
but if the address's data more than 128 bytes
you will need to add a more config like
```
curl http://localhost:8899 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getAccountInfo",
    "params": [
      "your bs58 address here"
      { "encoding": "base64" }
    ]
  }
'
```
Thank you, I'll try using this.
Thanks ! So it means I need to change all my `.toBase58()` to `.toBase64()` ?
in particular, not super keen on forking Metaplex üôÉ
Hey all! I've been looking into associating editable metadata with a Token generated by the Token Program. Is there a 'best practice' for doing this? I'm aware of the Metaplex framework, but I want to be able to specify a Program (which I write) to edit this 'metadata' post-mint, and I'm not sure if Metaplex provides that flexibility out of the box. I've thought up a way to home-bake a solution, but wanted to check if there are existing frameworks / examples for this üôÇ
not sure I understand your question. if you want to use map data structure on solana program. you can use BTreeMap. but in most situation you can solve it by PDA
if you use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress
it will return you txs which is this address involved. is it you finding?
yes. when you retrieve data over 128 bytes. you will need to specify base64 or base64+zsd format.
I mean using RPC API
Hi, is there any way to get list of transactions where some specific address is influenced? If not, then is there a way to get transactions in a block range?
and the error my node provider is giving me: 
```
Oct 08 12:08:58 nyc13 cache-rpc[50237]: Oct 08 12:08:58.891  INFO cache_rpc::rpc: can't cache for key pubkey=<redacted> error=RpcErrorOwned { code: -32600, message: "Encoded binary (base 58) data should be less than 128 bytes, please use Base64 encoding.", data: None }
```
the most used are these ones
do you mean the update authority of program?

method
Or the node provider ?
You mean the method ? (Like ‚ÄúgetProgramAccounts‚Äù)
which rpc you call trying to call?
(That‚Äôs what my RPC node provider told me)
I thought the current upgrade on mainnet (1.7.0) was making mandatory the use of base64 addresses ?
I think you just do base58 decode and then base64 encode.
but in solana we usually use base58 format address
not sure why you want to do it.
but the essential of pubkey is just a 32 bytes array
so basically you can do base64 / base58 encode to it
Hi, sorry didn't realize you were in web3 - that is from the spl-token cli in rust.  I'm not as familiar with the web3 yet, but it looks like there is a getAccountInfo function in the token javascript library https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/f630d71fdc0f3deb9e604c562601a757cdf22bd6/token/js/client/token.js#L762 that returns json.
How can i check update authority on an address solana web3?
Thanks for reply Caleb! Is this a solana cli command you share? i have not encountered this in solana web3 js lib
`spl-token --output json account-info <TOKEN_ADDRESS>` adding `>> account.json` to pipe output to a file named account.json.

Hello guys, I have been concept designing an NFT for Solana which I would like to add a staking protocol to accrue holders a token. I am wondering if that is possible to do on the solana network. can anyone tell me what I would need to research to figure out how?

Hi team,

We plan to deploy a spl token as an application asset for our ecosystem, can we write a program that help us bear the transaction fee and rent account fee for our users? We want our users to focus on the application layer on Solana without having to bother keeping SOL in their wallet.

Hi Dev Team, I have a problem loading the account data onchain knowing only its publicKey. I mean I am writing a Solana program that loads programmatically the data of an account knowing only its public key. I did not find any doc / support
i didn't use sol-wallet-adaptor i was working with the cli wallet and it is pretty easy to use that as the signer....
we re working on chain not using JS RPC so we can't use getAccountInfo. is there any equivalent solution to use in an on chain program
Anything that submits is going to cut you if you try to do anything but the most basic operation
You should only call `create*Instruction` methods
Oh I didn't realize we had stuff that starts with create and submits the transaction ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah I didn't instantiate it, was using the static method `createWrappedNativeAccount`. So you're suggesting to re-implement myself what that method does under the hood? In order to sign it properly.
Connection.getAccountInfo
hey, is there a way to read an account info on chain with only its public key?
Those methods are all static
Just call the `Token.create*` to build instructions and construct the TX yourself
I liked `createWrappedNativeAccount`  because it wraps 3 instructions under the hood https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/aef1e239b37f5547c2c86390f204da41b0965adb/token/js/client/token.js#L596
Especially if I can't extract the Keypair needed as an argument.

What is the alternative for wrapping SOL in the most convenient way?
You probably just don't want to instantiate a  `Token`. It's API is very limiting
is that the project serum sol-wallet-adapter?   its probably recommended you use the 
https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter

But in either case, you sign transactions with the wallet, you dont get its keypair. You would probably be doing something like this to sign a transaction: `transaction = await wallet.signTransaction(transaction);` if you need more signatures you might be using something like partial sign: `transaction.partialSign(...signers);`
Cool thanks this helped a lot
<@!872000929719791646> <@!144408253059694592> you guys had a discussion two days ago on a Keypair topic, perhaps you know the answer to the above? üôÇ
Looking at the `sol-wallet-adapter` Wallet class and can't find a way to get Signer/Keypair from it?

Need the `Signer` for `Token.createWrappedNativeAccount`
thank you!!
The SolHack discord might be a helpful resource too as you explore Solana, https://discord.com/invite/yRaZ23DXxM
so a contract address cant be used to store sol got it. so it's better to send them directly to the program owner wallet
the program account just holds an ELF executable, it's just code.  instead you could send sol to an account that's owned by your program.
can you please provide some explanation as to why not?  since in ethereum ether gets sent to the contract...... and then from there the user can withdraw from it. then do i have to send the user directly the SOL?
no
can i send sol to the my program address??
Token account rent is recoverable upon dispossession
Need a mint @ 80B, a token account @ 165B, then whatever the metadata account size is
```                RpcSimulateTransactionAccountsConfig {
                    encoding: Some(UiAccountEncoding::JsonParsed),
                    addresses: vec![
                        first,
                        second,
                    ],
                }``` this does not give me a human readable format but UiAccount with binary as base64
Sounds about like the right rent cost for the required accounts at recent SOL prices
so to make an NFT with an image and then mint it, is it standard to pay $2 each like on metaplex?
Is there an easy way to get the token account changes from `RpcClient` with solana_client?
I am in a struggle with `simulate_transaction_with_config` but it seems i need to unpack everything manually

Hello guys, just had a quick question: My Solana wallet recovery created a new wallet, and I was wondering if there is a way to access the old one
just checking if it made sense. i dont think there is really any 'transaction' subscribe. but yes there are 'on' event listeners that you can try like https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#onAccountChange.  other methods for program and logs are used as well.
my bad I accidentally clicked on the preview instead- yes this helps, thanks! is there also a stream I can subscribe to for getting latest txns for an account? is figuring it out from `accountSubscribe` the best bet?

In need of of web designing/development help. Dm me.
did you read the description of the link I sent? Many of these and more are for querying data and transaction history:
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2
A program has no way to sign anything, or transfer SOL that accumulated at it's address, correct? 
Since the program doesn't own itself
yeah I glanced over this but didnt see an obvious way to query txn history for an account - is this the recommended way of doing it: https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/rpc-transaction-history ?
the web3 as <@!616045157925650453>  mentioned, json rpc, and many other clients and sdks are available, some in <#763249718339567626>.  
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getSignaturesForAddress
Wanted to make sure I was thinking about this the correct way.
Thanks! <@!785084693023424542>
it depends on your design, but overall yes, the mint address, along with any other info should be passed into the program. It is up to your program, to validate the mint being passed in. The source code for the token program, token-swap and token-lending should have some examples in regards to some validations like this. you may want to make sure the mint address matches a value, and or it has an owner or authority, with a certain value.
which in turn uses the solana jsonrpc
you can use the solana web3js lib
what's the best way to query the solana chain? like given an address, are there any APIs that let me analyse the txn history?
hey so - quick question --maybe dumb. New to solana/rust. Trying to get the spl token account associated with a public key.. using the spl_associated_token_account program and get_associated_token_addresses function... the second param to this function is the mint address of the token in question..

should i assume that the client calling my contract is going to pass that in with the instruction?.. and furthermore on the client side would these most likely be hardcoded / some logic to derive the mint address of a token?
any help/guidance would be appreciated üôÇ
or what I do, I do most things onchain and use the user as payer üôä
IMO - never trust the user. If there are parameters in your account creation that you don't want to be tampered with, do it onchain
If it's something that doesn't matter much, it's fine to do it on the client as well
For a production ready solana dapp , would the general consensus be that dapp initialization and account creation should be done on-chain using your program  rather than on the client with javascript ?
got it, thanks a ton! (and <@!137101040687382528>)
im not sure exactly on that design aspect but if your talking about rewarding the user with a token, or nft in this case, then possibly yes, as long as they have an account of that token type (NFT, or otherwise), it sounds like it should work.  the underlying concepts are here:
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts#ownership-and-assignment-to-programs
yeah you'd create associated token account for the user, initialize the token+mint with spl token, and then mint a single token to that associated token account 
Maybe even better to revoke minting authority to make sure it's always stay 1 NFT
paste the signature into chat. and the cluster. someone might be able to investigate this more.
I see! and in the case of an NFT, would this makes sense. Let's say I want to create a game where user takes certain action which will result in an NFT-item being minted.

Architecturally I would have System program which owns (my game program account) which owns (N NFT accounts). And each time a player "wins" I'll create a new NFT account under my game program and assign authority to the user?
Ok , I think i've got it thanks !
yes. in a sense. its like the bank owns the safety deposit box and you own the contents of the safety deposit box and have the key, potentially much more secure than the physical comparison.
I see, so if I mint a token, the Token program will create an account that stores "my" tokens and will give me certain authority over it. I presume
you want to assign the authority to a key that can also sign, such as keypair, wallet address, or pda. as mentioned by dvcrn.
yes the accounts are owned by the program, and the 'user' or other address has authority over the account to perform certain functions on the account. in spl-token program there is a sense of 'token' owner, which may be confusing for the actual owner which is the underlying program. accounts are owned by programs. properties like owner or authority or anything else is generally given on an account, internally or through other data or meta data, that further defines constraints, roles, and capabilities within the program on the accounts for that program.
so you'd need a PDA
The program can't sign for anything itself, so while you can put the mint authority to your program, you won't be able to ever sign for that key
My question is apart the the same vein as fenixcpts question . When I create a new token , can I assign the tokens mint authority to my programId or does it have to be an account owned by my program
So if I use the `spl-token creat-token` : the tokens are stored in an account. and that owner is the Token Program right? And when a user mints, they will create an account owned by token program as well right? I guess I understand that it's account-centric. I just wonder about the ownership of these accounts. If I mint X fungible token do I then own that token account with X tokens or does the Token program owns it
Tokens are stored as accounts. Solana works in an account-centric way. 

Depends, if you build your own program, maybe. 

Not sure about the program specific questions.
hello fellow devs: this is a stupid question as I try to understand what's happening in solana but it's confusing the heck out of me -- under the solana programming model:

how are tokens (non-fungible and fungible) stored and managed? Does the Token program own an account for every user for every token out there (fungible)?

For NFTs does the token program then own an account for every single instance of an NFT as its separate account (supply 1, decimal 0, no future mint)?

When you mint an NFT do you just transfer authority of account with that singular NFT over to the minting account?
I'm guessing we can't change ownership of a PDA to a different program? üòÑ
Hey guys! Are partial deploys somehow feasible? Our program costs around 2.2 SOL per deploy, and a lot of accounts we use are PDAs so we can't use them from a smaller slimmed down program. 
Or is there some nifty way to migrate PDAs? Or some other way to deal with high deploy SOL cost?
Any idea why I have a duplicate transaction on Explorer? Both seem to have taken SOL from the wallet
for 'batch' concept in general, you can load a transaction up with instructions. and if needed send multiple transactions.
you have to source the data somehow. that generally involves getting/having the data, transforming it, or looping through it to at least prepare the data to send. 
this is a resource that may help as a reference if nothing else, for bulk, airdrops, etc:
https://github.com/cyriimm
noob question - what's the best way to do batch transfers/airdrops? (this article is for eth: https://hackernoon.com/3-methods-to-conduct-an-airdrop-intro-to-batch-transfers-the-unsung-heroes-of-blockchain-c3555b4875fe) like if I have a list of addresses, looping through all of them and conducting a transfer seems like it wouldn't utilize the parallelization of solana
Not exactly like that, but the metaplex (NFT) standard might be the closest thing you get atm. Non-fungible, with collections, editions, fractional ownership, editing metadata, and more.

im a dev, just curious about if there is a paved road for minting nfts. Is this the recommended resource on this? (https://solana.blog/solana-metaplex-tutorial-deploy-your-own-store-mint-nfts-and-setup-auctions/)
as a reference you could check this out:

What are you seeking for?
Are you an artist? Candy Machine/ Metaplex is de facto here.
does anyone know how large the ledger is if I have it at the min 50000000 ?
ok I think I get it now, I've gotta run a validator and then I guess I can leverage it myself as my own rpc node
gm - what would you guys say is the best resource for minting NFTs?
trying to do an RPC call from JS to my contract

hi, is there a simple example somewhere of how to build a web app that lets users mint nft's via image upload using arweave, like metaplex, but without using their application wholesale.  more of just integrating it as a feature of an existing site?
is there a solana flashloan contract anywhere?
like erc 1155
Hello devs, how quickly does it take Solana to reach block/transaction finality?
does solana have a semi fungible token standard?
good luck, and welcome!
I'm nowhere near 73 SOL, but I for sure could put in about 5 to secure a few hundred KB.
also, the cost of the max account size (10mb) would cost you 73 sol for a custom program, which i doubt you would come close to.
The docs are great, but you'll also find a lot of useful guides and reference implementations here.

https://solana.com/developers
Ok, thanks a lot Chase, this has been really informative :). Thanks for your time. I'll be sticking around and I'll start going through the docs.
yes
Yes. I could technically split my code so that NFT-focused stuff runs from a cheaper, Metaplex-built SC, and a secondary SC to deal with other logic.
Correct. You could leverage their smart contracts and create your own program with less code and try to use them all together
But I think Metaplex lowers that cost since they already have the Candy Machine and other such NFT-focused powers. Right?
but installing the CLI takes almost no time, so you can get that estimate by doing this on it ```solana rent <program.len>```
Now that you know it's cheaper, i do recommend taking a program and deploying to devnet to see for sure üôÇ
Yes, I know. That's why I'm here, haha. Unfortunately, so is everybody else, LOL üòÑ
Solana is one of the cheapest blockchains in the worst when it comes to rent/tx/cost
Thanks for the estimate!
Of course, factoring in the growth, I'm aware it could get more expensive.
That's still lower than the lowest I found so far.
for instance, the metaplex metadata program costed roughly 20-30 sol. but at the time, this was very cheap. now we are talking about $4000 - $5000
I think a ballpark estimate is doable. The price can be given in Solana, and the user will translate to whatever the current course of Solana is.
the cost of sol varies, program size varies, rent can change. it would be impossible to give these numbers accurately
*edited for clarity
well there are too many variables to do this
Personally I'm reluctant to even start installing the stack to run that command unless I know for sure this isn't going to end up costing me $10000 when I want to release.
Bullet point, 3 different Smart Contracts, just for motivate people to jump on.
I think it would be nice if you guys publish some numbers. Like... ok... cost for a SC with these many lines / this number of variables / memory taken, costs around this much.
yes
Yes, I know size matters üôÇ . So devnet provides actual, real cost estimates for this?
the size of the program matters
```solana rent <program.len>```
or you can use the cli
the best way to get a closer cost would be to take a program and deploy it to devnet on your own.
Of course ;). The deployment is where the fun is üòÑ
it costs you zero dollars to fork it
javascript/typescript
I'm just looking for number of zeroes üòÑ
Someone knows if it is possible to burn tokens with the Solnet lib?
Again, ballpark.
Ok, so what would it cost me to fork such as Smart Contract, adapt it to my needs, and then deploy it on the blockchain with a supposed Solana wallet?
Including something Called Candy Machine, that allows for bulk upload on the cli
A collection sits behind a Smart Contract right? It is its own token. And that SC has certain functions that may or may not be NFT-focused.
You want to make an NFT collection on Solana. Metaplex has created all the smart contracts that make this possible.
Yes :). Sorry, I sometimes say series due to syntax confusion with another blockchain I've been using so far for NFTs üôÇ
are you talking about an NFT collection?
And thanks for the all the links! I will go through them. The reason I want a ballpark cost is, of course, so I know if I should commit to Solana. Like most developers out there, I'm pretty full with projects üôÇ
what do you mean by "series"
Absolutely NO problem in using Metaplex' platform :), especially if it's not a 2nd layer solution. Still wondering about the costs to start a new series üôÇ
A smart contract can do more than just mint, right? I can have code in a SC that consults oracles, runs other things, not only NFT focused.
you don't have to use their platform
they have created smart contracts for this
https://docs.solana.com
Metaplex also is literally doing it directly on Solana.
this is very confusing. you said ignore nft, but you're talking about minting a collection or series, which sounds like NFT to me.
Thank you, <@!455114989397868556> . I wasn't asking about minting, but about how much does it cost to deploy a TOKEN (collection, series, whatever you want to call it). That is, a Smart Contract which can mint for me (and pay costs, etc). So I'm talking about an actual Smart Contract with logic in it which may not be purely NFT focused. Metaplex sounds interesting, but I'm interested in doing this directly on Solana. 

In other words, ignore what I said about NFTs and simply give me a ballpark figure about how much would it currently cost to deploy some decent functionality on the Solana blockchain. Other blockchains have costs as  high as tens of thousands of dollars. I found one that claims they do it for "just" $7000. I still find that ridiculous when it comes to startup developers that are just starting with some idea. The bar of entry is too high. It seemed to me like Solana may be doing something about that :). So, what's the score? üòÑ
ok thanks
again, you'd need to talk to their support. we only support solana explorer
in what language?
I mean all information about my token i can view it solana explorer but i couldn t show on solana beach when i entering my token address there ??
i actually barely understand your question
I have not connected that server you know, thats why i have not questioned here ? If you can help?
https://discord.gg/cWKprEbG
but you should be asking this in the metaplex discord
that is the ballpark cost per mint

this sounds like a question for solana beach, not solana developer support
Hey guys does anyone have a working example of converting a mnemonic back to a keypair using bip39 and bip32? Just figured out I was doing that wrong and I'm finding a lot of fairly complex answers as I search for a solution
So, let's see who can answer this one. How much will it cost, ballpark, to deploy an NFT token on Solana? Complexity will be moderate. It's not a PFP project, but an actual game.
Any answers??
Probably not deployed on devnet or deployed, but at a different address.  You should ask these questions in the Metaplex discord though

Hi there

We are looking to deploy our stablecoin protocol on Solana and were wondering if there was anyone from the Solana ecosystem team that we could chat with?

Hello team, how to set up a RPC endpoints with full node data, from block 1 to latest block. We have a 15T disk, if it's space is enough? Thanks a lot.

Right, awesome, thank you

Is there a chainlink equivalent in the solana ecosystem? How to query external data sources in a solana program?
no its generating the child accounts. your wallet is the 12 words.
to send token you need the token account's authority and correct destination
if you are still confusing you can post your code here. I can take a look.
thanks for clarifying. I'm trying to understand why I am unable to send the token. wanted to make sure the token creation wasnt the issue.
Yeah that was my original question lol
yes. I think you can.
right, the tx is signed by myWallet and mintAccount but then after that, can myWallet just send the token without mintAccount's private key, meaning to say, i can discard mintAccount's private key after signing the initial tx?
the first create account you will use the mint account's private key
after that if you want to do freeze or mint, you use the authority
create account need funder and new account to sign
<@788215642070581289> if this is correct (assuming your thumbs up means correct) does that mean i have to keep mintAccount's private key? I wont be able to transfer the token by signing with just myWallet?
fancy stuff
well you can check the token account data before/after too, it's probably how phantom / solflare know you're going to receive an NFT when you buy on a marketplace
Yeah, but I want to check token accounts lol
yeah I assume you'd need to parse the value.accounts.addresses & check the payer.lamports before/after the simulation, assuming it simulated a successful execution at all
It probably depends on the token contract
Ye I'm looking web3 docs en and it doesn't really say what exactly data is
anyway I want to double check -- so a PDA has no associated private key, does this mean the ONLY way it could ever be signed for is at run time in the program it was derived for? Just want to cover my bases before moving forward with this & it comes back to haunt me üòõ
this is what I am doing, can you tell me if I am doing it wrong:

I have myWallet as payer
1. Generate a new random keypair called mintAccount
2. Create a system.Account with mintAccount as newAccountPubKey, program ID is tokenProgram
3. Initialize a mint with with mintAccount as mintAccount.PubKey from step 1, mintAuth and FreeAuth as myWallet
4. Create associated token address with wallet and payer as myWallet, and then mint as mintAccount (step 1)
5. Mint to step 4 assoc token address as destination account, MintAccount as mintAccount (step 1) and authAccount as myWallet.

Is this correct?
(I assume)

only account belongs to A that A can modify its data.
so for your question. you use A to call B then B change the state.
actually B can only change state that belongs to him
so A can't revert it or B is trying to change A's state that will cause tx error
oh but this is for *generating* the wallet -- i'm trying to retrieve the accounts that are already created

if a Solana program (A) calls another program (B) to change the state, but program A reverts after the call, will the state still be changed on program B?
Hi chido how do I do that ?
Is there a way to do this via CLI? I don't see any way in the docs to set the derivation path on `solana account PUB_KEY`
in solana, token account address is different to sol address
so you will need to use token account to getTokenAccountBalance
how to create a token account or get your wallet's token account are all in the link
here is a example to create spl token https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/create-mint/main.en.ts
is the mint account suppose to be a PDA ?
PDA is just a normal account but use program to sign.
so basically you can make PDA to be a mint account
Error: failed to get token account balance: Invalid param: not a v2.0 Token account
I got
const temp = await connection.getTokenAccountBalance(wallet);
When I do
you can take a look at https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/README.en.md
so the 'X' value would be, 1,2,3,4,5?
no sorry, i use raw RPC requests
Thank you rafino. Do you have any examples with solana w3 sdk ?
I don't know whats the Phantoms derivation path , but I know that in Solnet ( C# solana lib ) , you get a new account from a wallet by replacing the x in the private `const string DerivationPath = "m/44'/501'/x'/0'";`. I guess it should be similar.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountbalance
I would like to get list of tokens that owned and balances
getBalance(PublicKey) just gives the balance of SOL of an account
Anyone knows how to get all token balances of an account with Solana web3.js ?
confused as to how to create an spl token. is the mint account suppose to be a PDA?
kk thx
not sure man, havent touched sub wallets on phantom
so these "sub-accounts" must be associated with the primary wallet in some fashion
if you press "add/connect wallet" it will keep loading the previous accounts that were created prior until it actually creates a new account
but
for example if you were to uninstall phantom, reinstall it and then enter your seed phrase you only see your primary wallet
dude thanks
I chatted with Phantom and they confirmed that these are just "accounts" created from the primary wallet, not actual new wallets (because if they were they would have seed phrases)
no I'm just trying to access all the accounts created under the primary wallet account
<@!837367597167018017>
for nft drops
are you trying to deploy multiple wallets to one smartcontract?
I dont think so
Questions on how to traverse all the accounts created from my main phantom wallet account.

When a user creates a new wallet on Phantom this is their "main" or "primary" account -- it has a seed phrase, a private key and a public key and is easily retrievable with the cli command `solana account PUBLIC_KEY`

However, when a user creates a new wallet in Phantom it creates a new `account` that only has its own private key, no seed phrase.

How can I access all of these accounts via CLI command? Meaning, the `accounts` that Phantom creates underneath the primary wallet account.  

Let's say I have my primary wallet created and I create 5 additional "wallets" (aka `accounts`) within the Phantom app.  I want to be able to traverse all the accounts associated with the primary wallet's public key and simply obtain their public key values.

Is this possible?

Hey SOL Gang, looking for a possible solution to spamming multiple wallets. Can I just loop keygen create and store address?
All example so far were passing either `BN` or `PublicKey`, which doesn't really explain anything
If I create a custom data type in Rust with Anchor, how can I pass it as an argument in JS code?
its just anything to paste a link instead of a lot of code inline in the chat.
https://pastebin.com/  or there are many similar.
metaplex does some different cools things, look at the utils folder, there should be some utility functions that solve that issue. its possible to extend or include things that do not exist as well, and sometimes the reference to the right thing is what is needed. look at this ref:
https://github.com/near/borsh-js/blob/master/borsh-ts/index.ts
as an example.   seach on `capitalize`
also i dont know of how to use the paste bin
instruction
 data
 name
 symbol
 uri
 sellerFeeBasisPoints
 creators
in else of write first fiels
 creators
 creators
 address
(node:48610) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: writer[capitalizeFirstLetter(...)] is not a function

at the address field of type of PublicKey it gives this error and i don't know what to make of it....

hello, so i'm trying to create an spl token. when i create the new account for mint account, is it suppose to be a PDA?
Hey guys!
Where can I post a vacancy for Solana developer?)
yes i'm sorry i didn't mention  it........
ok. it was not listed above.  that error could indicate a borsh issue.  for large code its better to put a link, paste bin or gif. but yea i see it.
even more odd is the NFT renders just fine on the explorer! The video dimensions are massive but it shows up there
Creator is in the schcema
Can anyone provide me the correct format of the asset URL that Phantom wallet uses to ready mp4s? I'm trying to get our NFT to show the video in the phantom wallet but it can't render it.

The request goes out to where the asset is located (s3 bucket right now) and the URL is https://s3...name/1.mp4 and it still won't load. The request is 206 which means partial content is coming in. Is it possible I need to specify the extension query param? ex `?ext=mp4` 

Unfamiliar with how phantom renders things so if anyone has any ideas pls lmk!
I would reference the demo, or dapp scaffold: in the link i sent you. if your not sure how it might help to do a few react tutorials.
Yeah, https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/blob/9fe980e559166e5868bf46c0f144e88142d9b101/src/lib/tokenlist.ts#L5-L9
<@!785084693023424542> do you know how i can put the connect wallet / buy button on my website?
Thanks
Pretty sure they're listed in the file
may help to go through this to get some methodology down:
https://spl.solana.com/token
basically, the user will need a wallet, and a token account (specifying the token mint when you created your token) needs to be created/associated for that users wallet address, and then they can receive your created token. an account is funded (paid rent) when it is created, its possible to fund and create the users account yourself, or depending on how they receive your token they can pay for creation.
thank you

My second question, I want to create a token on solana and give those to different users of my mobile application. Do I have to create separate wallet address for each user and And then token account into it. If so, those wallet won't have sol, how rent would be paid.

Sorry if i am asking silly questions as I am new to solana and just reading documents.
anyone can help me on this?
hey guys, I am having issue while `anchor build`
Can someone please explain why there is different address is get when I use same seed for ask and prompt://.

If both are same wallet then why amount in one is not visible in second.
101, it just means mainnet, 102/103 may be test and dev.
Creator needs to be in the schema as well. Try to copy again.
What is "chainId:101" in token-list repo, what is its purpose, does it have anything to do with eth network?
Are there any specific characteristics for DEVNET? Maybe things like that it gets purged every x amount of time or something like that?
**TypeError: writer[capitalizeFirstLetter(...)]*is not a function** 
borsh is giving me this error and i dont know what is it about?
i think it is about the schema.... but code copied from metaple repo...  
[
    CreateMetadataArgs,
    {
      kind: 'struct',
      fields: [
        ['instruction', 'u8'],
        ['data', Data],
        ['isMutable', 'u8'], // bool
      ],
    },
  ],

    Data,
    {

        ['sellerFeeBasisPoints', 'u16'],
        ['creators', { kind: 'option', type: [Creator] }],
      ],
    },
  ],



when i Pass creators array it it gives this error....
Thank you so much. it worked
Saw some discord group is able to import some bot to update nft sales from some nft marketplaces. May I know is there any plugin at discord to do that or they scan the data from solana? Thanks
It doesn't work at all. No callbacks are triggered
I apologize if this is a dumb question, but I can't seem to find the answer to this. 

When getting a transaction using the getTransaction() RPC call, I see preBalance/postBalance info. Does Solana allow duplicate account entries, per instruction, in these lists? Do I need to worry about a single account being listed multiple times? Or is each account only listed once?
havent heard about any recent issue there, or not working at all. its usually reported its inconsistent or misses. dont see a git issue either. generally there is 1 or both of these unless you got lucky and are first. ?
crickets here in regards to that so far.. cant test myself atm.
run the install again, look at the doc. it should output the path for you to copy.  and ull add it to your bas/zsh or other profile that your terminal loads and uses. or wherever else your adding your env variables
<@!785084693023424542> thank you buddy. you helped me tremendously.
i added encoding ="jsonParsed" on my code and now i can get more information about that particular token in my address.
thank you. so which value do i have to add to path?
your path probably got hosed and was only temporary, you need to add it to you perma variables like other path.
https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools#macos--linux
probably wont hurt to just run it again, and make sure you copy the path and put it in your path/profile etc so it loads with terminal every time.  just putting export in a console/terminal tends to be temporary/per session by default.
sorry, i was confused, lol
If you know the answer then yes, please :), if not then it's not related to your CLI questions, it's about web3 api
is it for me?
Has anything changed for onProgramAccountChange() on public rpc nodes? It stopped working entirely for me and doesn't trigger any callbacks, but the same code did work before and still works ok against local node
actually, I installed solana cli and it worked. but after reboot the system, it doesn't recognize the `solana` command
if you look at docs like this you can see there are different ways to request things, including encoding.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountsbyowner
I dont know how your trying to query or with what, but overall requests generally have params that help with the results.
hey guys, may I know how to update PATH environment variable for solana cli on mac?

#Dropped Here for Reference
Hi, if there are any experienced rust devs on here who are looking for a well paid side gig, please drop me a DM
greetings all
i just began my developing journey with solana blockchain
i have a python background (not an expert)
i would like to play around with python and solana
i am trying to query an address and get the tokens it has
i get this response
{'data': ['2guT7Po5bk/h0B/W+B8r19pEX508XKLBsx1XEHoEVk7tKBOlH6KF23k1wsvw1s1m2IQO/DhuEJGaF+eHqpbgFgEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA', 'base64']
anyone knows how can i deserialise the data so i can view in human form what exactly this data is?
Thank you <@!814228493302497301> been scouring the discord, hopefully I find a useful guide there
<#763249718339567626>
Hey, if anyone knows of an good tutorial on cross program invocation . Please share!
was wondering if there's some kind of guide that can give a developer a good overview of how Solana works, what accounts, programs are. How's data stored etc, I could use that alongside a tutorial to really grok Solana
Tried reading the docs but they were ok and not very great
as long as your following the repo guidelines and readme you may be able to try a PR
?????
I have not seen any for stepping thorough the wallet itself. But the examples and demo are pretty good. here is a tutorial in anchor that implements a wallet.  
https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-solana-development-with-react-anchor-rust-and-phantom-3291
`solana transaction-history --show-transactions --output=json $address` seems really slow, even for a wallet with a small number of transactions (e.g. <20). It seems like the `show` option is the culprit here too
<@!785084693023424542> 

Our app is already up and running in dev. It runs different contests.

I have been using a nodejs server to create solana accounts(used as wallets) for each contests and do the transactions(solana/web3). 

But the app lacks on onchain data. So iam trying to move my server storage into onchain. So its just going to:
account-data will have an empty array to start with and instruction will pass one contestObj everytime the program is called. 
The program will receive the contestObj and push it to the account's array. return.

It would be really helpful if you can shed some light on this.
Is there any video tutorials for this?
I mean  do we have to wait for making pr till end of  Hackaton event  or we can submit our project as a pr when we want???
can you try to submit a PR?
yeah i would really appreciate your help on that <@!785084693023424542>
Hi there, !  I have a question about solana labs/ecosystem repo .Although   our project is on development road , our token and wallet have verified already  and we can see all information explorer. Main question is that can we create a pr for share our project on solana labs/ecosystem repo in github ?? Support please ???‚úã
ahh.  what are you trying to store and retrieve exactly?  it sounds like some design thought is needed.  what frank said.
Agree with <@!785084693023424542> .
You can pretty much store anything in the account data (with some restrictions). This includes associative structures, lists, arrays, etc., strings, numbers, json... yada-yada-yada
What you need to consider is the overall account data layout and a strategy to serialize/deserialize the data to/from the account
For example, many programs include an "initialized" byte as a quality measure and then chunks of operational data
That is up to you
the first part is from javascript sending that in a transaction. <@!785084693023424542> . Thanks for the help
here is the wallet adapter and associated demo and examples:
https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter
i mean, virtually anything could be serializable, so many things are possible. im not sure why you would be looking at array and not vector.  you may want to go read up on rust and some borsh. it will take some time, but seems like there is a knowledge drop that is needed.
Hi , who knows how i can make a buy button to pay with phantom wallet
<@!785084693023424542> So you think its possible to 
{
array: []
} **with instruction** {name: 'test'}
Can be used to return as
{
array: [{name: 'test'}]
} from the **program**?
not that I know of off hand. its rust and borsh at that point.
you may have to see if there is something there that suits your needs according to what they might do. ive seen it mentioned as an airdrop resource.
<@!785084693023424542> is there any example for array to vector then back to array for programs?
Serialize an array of objects and pass it into program (works for me)
in rust using try_from_slice get the array into vector (works for me)
Now how to push a struct into that vec and serialize it back to account?
Which repository exactly?
Hi , who knows how i can make a buy button to pay with phantom wallet
is there any other way?
thank you

in ethereum, a smart contract, in solana is a program. a contract address in ethereum, is like a program Id (address/key) in solana. there are explorers similar to etherscan, that may offer similar or different features and still adding features and expanding capabilities: https://solanabeach.io/, https://explorer.solana.com/, https://solscan.io/ 
a program Id/address itself, once deployed, would not be changed (like an eth contract address). however in solana the program can be updated.

Here are some ethereum/solidity -> solana resources: solidity to solana:

Who knows how to do airdrop on a large number of addresses? I use Windows if anything!
I am new to developing solana program and quite confused the concept of smart contracts in the solana.
1.  It seems quite simple to locate the contract address in ethereum, say searching opensea in etherscan. How could we do the same thing on solana? Say the contract address for Alpha Art
2. Does these program id stay the same or could be changed?
Thanks

Hey does anyone knows how to read transaction data of a smart contract / program?
Ok thanks
its helpful if you post a gist or pastebin` how your querying . as there are multiple ways to query and params its hard to say why you may be getting certain results.
this may help: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountsbyowner
if you search the chat history in addition to docs, and source, there may be several examples.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-reference#transaction
search on `addsignature` in the solana source code.
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/web3.js
there may be other examples throughout github and elsewhere
Thanks for your suggestion

Hi everyone, I'm new to Solana and I have a question about transferring money directly from a wallet to a user-defined Solana program. Suppose that I created a Solana program and deployed it to a cluster, for every tutorials I could find, if I want to send money from a wallet to my created program, I have to create a web client and connect it to the wallet. Then, the web client will be responsible for transferring the money from the wallet: setting instruction, sending the request, etc., to the program. I wonder that if it's possible to transfer money directly from a wallet to a program without connecting to any web applications? Every response would be appreciated :))). Thank you everyone
Hi Friends. I am trying to read Metaplex Metadata account data. My Problem is, I am not sure how to pass the data in the Metadata struct provided in metaplex contract state.

Hey, Is there any good tutorial/video tutorial on cross-contract-invocation? Please share if there is.
so, i wrote web3 for my program using command line based wallet approach now i'm looking to connect to an external wallet let's say phantom,  @project-serum/sol-wallet-adapter will this npm package be sufficient enough for that purpose?
https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/
the first line you can likely disregard, if its typescript or related client. however , it would be good to log what that value is before sent.  the error would seem to indicate then for some reason accountInfo there is null. also, there is some kind of anchor issues with fetching the IDL i have observed lately, so I would ask in the anchor forum whats going on with that.  it will say account does not exist, when fetching IDL, but I have not looked into why.
anchor discord:
https://discord.gg/SEn9v69H
my smart contract stores tokens i.e owner of the token holder is my program id. Now, i want to withdraw token from my smart contract. Anyone have reference about this ?
Thanks! When I try on my own to fetch the accountInfo on my own it succeeds if I try 
```accountInfo?.data```
but says "Object might be null" if I do without the ?

But in 
```anchor.Program.fetchIdl()```
there exists a line that states 
```let idlAccount = decodeIdlAccount(accountInfo.data.slice(8));```
and that is where I get the failure

I don't know where to use the ContestInfo schema in this serialisation <@785084693023424542>
what error do you get when the schema is there?
I mean I have a schema for that. But where should I provide it for this serialisation? <@785084693023424542>
Is there any example of that?
i dont see any schema in the Map object for ContestInfo?  it should likely have its own class and schema defined so borsh knows how to try to deserialize if possible. the only schema i see shown is for ContestsObj, which is not ContestInfo.  ContestInfo should have a schema in addition to ContestsObj.

anshul:  something like that should be possible yes. resources, guides, docs related to NFTs above.
cc: <@!451874752676495360> 
that type of error usually indicates that the object, containing 'data' in this case, is null. Its possible in your case somehow asccountInfo is null. otherwise it could be some other object. If your using the cli some commands may have the 'verbose' flag -v. also if there is any logging available to reference, and if not you could try logging inside the program. hard to say without code. Metaplex discord may have more insight if its metaplex related.
Attempting to modify the candy machine program to do some custom things. My custom candy machine deploys correctly, but when I attempt the upload cli argument I get the error "TypeError: Cannot read property 'data' of null" when there is a line that tries to access accountInfo.data. What's the best way to even begin debugging this? My program deployed successfully, looks normal to me, VS Code doesn't throw any errors, but clearly there's some error.

fwiw I'm just adding a way to split payments to multiple wallets. In the nft-candy-machine/src/lib.rs lines 82-93 I'm just adding 2 more invoke statements, and calculating payment splitting. Not sure if this throws an obvious red flag to anyone but I'd appreciate any advice
Hi, I need to ask if it is possible to create an open NFT marketplace using Solana. 

Basically in this marketplace, any user can mint their own nft and that nft would also be listed for sale. Our team is almost done with this kind of marketplace in ethereum using rariable sdk, but we need to provide our users an option to use solana as well for minting. 

Is it possible, are there any guides or instructions which can help us to achieve this?
Hi Everyone, how can i serialize a schema with a class in a field in borsh:

      fields: [
        ['counter', 'u32'],

]);

const GREETING_SIZE = borsh.serialize(
  GreetingSchema,
  new ContestsObj({counter: 1, contests: **new ContestInfo({name: 'testing'})**}),
).length;
This throws error:
**fieldPath: [ 'contests' ],
  originalMessage: 'Class ContestInfo is missing in schema'**

hmm, I am a windows fan tho üòâ
Oh yes if you can use a Mac then that'll be a much better experience
gotcha. then i will move to MAC
I believe so, yes.  Not 100% sure because I don't use windows.  But people that are using windows report that WSL is the way, since we do not have full support for native windows
so if I install WSL, then I need to follow the linux instructions for everything? like solana cli
Please read my last message again üôÇ
Can I use native windows?
You need to use WSL if you are on Windows
I mean, in detail please
how?
Fix all of the incompatibilities
how can I resolve this issue?
`Solana Rust BPF toolchain is not available on Windows`
Hey guys,
Hey, 
```rust
    invoke_signed(
        &instruction_for_metaData,
        accounts,
        &[&["carddata".as_bytes()]],
    )?;
```
The order in the `accounts` Here also matters? I have verified the order of accounts in `instruction_for_metaData.accounts`
Is there an efficient way to get all the NFT accounts for a given owner?

I know I could do something like `getTokenAccountsByOwner` or `getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner` and then fetch metadata for each mint and check if maximum supply is 1, but seems pretty resource intensive as I would have to do 1+N requests to fetch all the data?
hit up the chats for the same. its good to get feedback, brainstorm, get clarifications, report issues, and seek improvement

always, friend me!
anchor docs are still light after the nice intro - but there are a lot of example apps now.  anchor like solana has a big bright road ahead, and can always use some great contributors going forward. It is still early enough where docs and learning can be a little more challenging than they will be. tools, etc.  lots of great things ahead I see.
I could use a sounding board for a lot of this stuff and am currently working solo
Would you be interested in having a thought/complaints partner?
I know what you mean. Literally had the same complaints awhile ago and my teammate just figured stuff out with me. We‚Äôre so early.
Theres just times I wish I was more mature.
Yeah I did the paulx tutorial like everyone else did. After the carpal tunnel healed I decided to explore anchor. I just wish there were more complete tutorials for anchor. For instance when I asked in their discord to a good example of initializing a PDA in anchor they didn't direct me to a nice tutorial in the docs instead pointed me to some random tests in the raw code. Which, sure fine. Im a big boy L6 I can handle that. Its just not a super great experience imho.
Anchor is a framework, so you get the benefits of a framework. It also takes care of most serialization/deserialization, has a test framework setup, has the macro magic, constraints, built-ins, and produces IDL for quick and easy client SDK usage. Not to mention a talented team of contributors. It does take some time to understand it, and can save a lot of time as well. It is also growing very fast. More are using and contributing than ever. I would say if your not convinced, and your comfortable enough with Native do Native and continue to play or try various things with anchor.  You can also choose to use native aspects instead, and use native functionality side by side, instead of, or in addition to, for most if not all? things. So there should only be added benefit in the longer run. They can explain much better in the anchor discord if you have specific questions. 

Also here is the anchor discord:
https://discord.gg/SEn9v69H
I struggled with this as well. I ended up choosing anchor after writing tons of boilerplate with raw runtime code.
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/examples/create_mint_and_transfer_tokens.js#L51
to create associated token you can use https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/create-token-account/main.en.ts#L61
just change TEST_MINT to NATIVE_MINT that you got the wrapped sol ATA
Yeah ive gone through all that, Im an experienced engineer. Im mostly wanting to know is this the path I want to go down for building solana programs or should I stick to the raw SDK. Anchor does a alot of "macro magic" that Im not sure will be useful in the longrun.
a NFT is just a mint so you can use token transfer to transfer it.
about more about token operation you can refer to https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/README_EN.md
anchor is a good start and its doc is very detail so just go through it!
https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html
Okay, so I've successfully wrapped SOL. How to make associated token account out of that one?

At which point  `Token.createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction` comes into play hereüëá
https://gist.github.com/imprfekt/90d35b599ec1016ac9649ab8ac91815b 
can't wrap my head around this... (pun intended)
do you guys know how to transfer a nft from one wallet to another using nodejs?
Does anyone have any experience with Serum's Anchor lib?
Anyone knows web3 or knows someone who could help us? He gets profit too
We will make a big NFT project on Solana and we need minting on site and a website. Doxx, legit.
The repeatable loop there that might be useful to others trying to debug transaction errors is:

1. turn on the debug logs by setting RUST_LOG=DEBUG in environment
2. Get the RPC error on `rpc_custom_error.rs` in the solana-client library
3.  If there is a custom program error, convert the hex value to decimal and then see if there is a custom error struct in the library and look for the error at the zero based index for the converted hex value
ü¶ó ü¶ó sorry about blathering on
that was it - the creator's array didn't sum to 100! https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/de29e6e1a3981dbe98affc75f455943b4488f939/rust/token-metadata/program/src/error.rs#L199
do you think I take the 45th error from here? https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/rust/token-metadata/program/src/error.rs
this seem to be the culprit `14: Program metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s failed: custom program error: 0x2d`
` export RUST_LOG=DEBUG` gets debug logs printed to console
what kinds of things could cause a preflight error?
this is a start https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/client/src/rpc_custom_error.rs
where can I find these log messages and error codes. They are being thrown from here:

```rust
                    config
                        .rpc_client
                        .send_and_confirm_transaction_with_spinner(&transaction)?
```
it is a bit unergonomic to have a type throw
i have seen many libs adding odd code to circumvent that
looks to me like any of the spread checks are just user sanity alerts. you can always transaction.instructions.push if you want instead right? .add is just a utility.  in other cases, the spread isnt always checked. but he would have better insight of course.
Hi, I'm trying to use SystemProgram at client side. I want to know which on-chain program receive it's request. I've searched "entrypoint", but there are many result in below repo.
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana
Please tell me which is the entrypoint of SystemProgram.
<@!585868308419444749> not sure, but it looks like the lamport transfer needs to be the last statements in a transaction for it to work? So that kind of breaks the goal to make this super smooth for the users... üò¶ It's way passed my bedtime, so going to sleep on it for a bit...
Hmm... https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/20348
I'm trying this now, but get a `sum of account balances before and after instruction do not match` error:

```
        **pda_account.lamports.borrow_mut() = pda_account.lamports() - 100_000_000;
        **new_account.lamports.borrow_mut() = new_account.lamports() + 100_000_000;
```
Funny enough if I log the lamports it shows:
```
[2021-10-12T23:48:20.538690000Z DEBUG solana_runtime::message_processor] Program log: pda lamps: 1000000000
[2021-10-12T23:48:20.538934000Z DEBUG solana_runtime::message_processor] Program log: new lamps: 0
<after transfer>
[2021-10-12T23:48:20.539216000Z DEBUG solana_runtime::message_processor] Program log: pda lamps: 900000000
[2021-10-12T23:48:20.539462000Z DEBUG solana_runtime::message_processor] Program log: new lamps: 100000000
```
Which seems to line up perfectly...
this will avoid requiring some conditional stuff in all the instruction building code
```let cleanupInstructions: TransactionInstruction = []
if (!itNeedsSomeCleanup) {
    cleanupInstructions.add(createCleanupIx());
}
...
tx.add(...cleanupInstructions)```
whats an example of what you are wanting to do in this scenario?  isnt this just checking to see when you add an instruction that at least 1 exists? maybe I dont follow?  add() is for adding instruction(s). Are you saying its annoying to make an array to add 1 instruction? üôÇ
<@!466984915376799748> https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/49d3d794590303f135561bee68aff8ff77927e70/web3.js/src/transaction.ts#L181-L200 the
```    if (items.length === 0) {
      throw new Error('No instructions');
    }```
in all those spread functions, the check is quite annoying as one cannot push to an array in a simple way when ix are needed.
Are those really necessary?
I'm testing this using `program_test` btw, not sure if that matters
Tried a couple of things but doesn't seem to work as expected. Does this need to be in it's own transaction? Or should it (the added lamports) be available directly so that the next CPI in the same transaction can already see/use it? As I still get the rent-exampt error
thank you, i am going to trumpet this far and wide
i am flipping out
I also lost a lot of hours on this üòÖ
haha don't worry about it üôÇ
can you DM me a solana addr? I want to thank you, i lost >24hrs of my life to this and you just saved the day
any tips on how to debug transaction simulation errors - they don't seem to be printint to solana logs, I guess because they aren't going through?

```
RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x2d [14 log messages]
```
How can I get more details - it says 14 log messages
metaplex crate is buggy, point cargo to github instead and it'll work
did you ever find a resolution to this? I am seeing the same issue with a writable privilege escalation error, but the account in question is both writable & a signer
If you find out what wallet sent tokens to a program, let us know.  They should be able to reject loader-owned recipients
So it turned out to be in-sufficient fund in the deployment account! Hope this helps someone!
The SOL should just be the rent-exempt reserve.  Tokens are gone, yeah
some tokens and SOL have been sent to my program address. that's lost yeah? 
I asked previously and the answer was "programs can't receive SOL", but my program account clearly has some SOL and tokens on it. Can I just assume those are burnt since there is no way to sign a transaction to move them?
Ok... Let me try that! Ow man, I completely forgot about that this is also a way to transfer SOL (next to using the instruction). I think you nailed it, let me check if this works üôÇ
Something like 
```
**funding_account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()?.checked_sub(lamports)?;
**new_account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()?.checked_add(lamports)?;
```
Just do the arithmetic
How? Not using the `system_instruction::transfer` instruction as that gives me the same error...
You can
But if I can transfer SOL from my PDA to another account that would also work... But I guess that has the same limitations.
I am trying to use a funding account that I own (which is a PDA) to create another account that can then be used to initialize a mint into.
You need to do the lamports manipulations before making that call
You said the funding account was owned by your program.  If it's funded, it exists
I am able to call these two instructions, but then the next call is one that checks is the account is rent-exempt and then failed on that not being the case.
I'm really super grateful that you are trying to help me, and I see now what you mean... Yet I'm not sure I understand how there can be funds on an account that isn't created yet? As the check will only skip the transfer if the account you are about to allocate has enough SOL.
Like so?
is there any way to user figment and still run usin web3 cluster commands?

```
  const connection = new web3.Connection(
    web3.clusterApiUrl(process.env.BOT_API_MODE)
  ); 
```
Sounds like you need to pony up for RPC infra with higher rate limits
I think it's a problem with solana because it's a server error that answers with a 429 error
```5$ solana program deploy /Users/tomoima525/workspace/rust/xx/rust/target/deploy/xxx.so Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x1`
```
Hi, I'm having a trouble deploying a program on mainnet-beta... I was able to deploy them on devnet the error is below but not sure what the custom error is
You use _your_ program to debit the payer's account, then  issue the `System::Assign`, `System::Allocate` and whatever initialization instructions you require
yes
Notice how no `System::Transfer` is ever issued
Probably going to need a native program ala `Secp256k1` https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs#secp256k1-program
But how is this a solution? How can I use this to pay for these CPIs using funds on a PDA instead of the person who signed the transaction? I actually already copies and tried it, but still the same error (of course as these are also system calls, so the transfer will not succeed)
You should be able to get the `Pubkey` for free by passing it in the accounts list.  I'm pretty sure you're going to blow the compute budget trying to sigverify though
Right, what I was going to suggest is to just stick the the message in the instruction data and require the signer to sign the whole transaction.  But if the message is in an account that won't work
Actually need to verify in the program that the message (account information) signed by the signer off-chain.
That's the justification, stealing from SPL ATA is the solution
I've seen and read that. Also looked at the code, but I don't understand how this is an answer to my question. Unless I should only look at the first few words: `You can't use create_account due to the order of operations` üòè
Do you really need to verify the message in isolation or would it be sufficient for the message to be included in instruction data with the rest of the transaction?
Would it be possible to add a range function to the getInflationReward method? So instead of pulling rewards for only a single epoch you could give a start and end epoch and get everything in between in a single call.
Hi all, had anyone tried to verify ed25519 on chain?  I tried using ed25519_dalek, but even constructing the PublicKey object gave me Access Violation in stake frame. 

`let publicKey = PublicKey::from_bytes(&ctx.accounts.auth.key.as_ref()).unwrap(); `

The goal is trying to verify signed messages from the signer, would appreciate any ideas to do it on chain. <:pepepray:847897348424335430> <:pepepray:834817528412897300>
You need to talk to Metaplex folks about Candy Machine
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/897583759245865031
Hello, I have a question, when I try to upload my assets on the mainnet with candy machine, I get this error, I have already tried several times, do you have an idea where the problem could come from please?
<@!585868308419444749> sorry if I'm just blind, but I've read all till now... These are the last messages I see in that conv:
but if you were just starting a test validator and used the --url flag without the --clone comand it would start a validator based on the value of the --url flag instead of the config?
in that case, it is starting the local test-validator based on the url in the config file, but using the --url flag to indicate where the program should be cloned from?
You may need to do that from a clean ledger, I don't think it'll add accounts other than at initialization
thank you
And that clone command looks accurate
`test-ledger`, but yes
this works

```
    -c, --clone <ADDRESS>...
            Copy an account from the cluster referenced by the --url argument the genesis configuration. If the ledger
            already exists then this parameter is silently ignored
```

If I wanted to clone the token-metadata program from mainnet to my local test validator would I enter:

```
solana-test-validator --clone  metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s --url m
```
You need to read the thread.  I reply a couple messages later.  Just keep reading
So reading the code you linked to (https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/1c417ffa4f9874a8df43a39746a790224421b13b/associated-token-account/program/src/tools/account.rs#L13) I'm not sure how this solves my challenge? Looking at the code I still see system calls that require a funding account.
mentioned RPCs: Figment, runnodes, quicknode
Whats a good API/RPC as a service for not getting rate limited on Solana?
ok, thanks
you want `--clone`, see `solana-test-validator --help` for details
It doesn't have to be exactly the same, I just wanted to interact with the same address - it is the token-metadata program. I tried the --program-id overide flag when I deployed, but it wants a keypair file for the first deploy
You want the same binary data as MB or devnet?
how can I deploy a program to my local test validator with the same address it has on main and dev nets?
just asking if there are any devs working on solana + elrond
aha i know  (didnt want to disturb üôÇ )
nope only solana stuff on the solana discord server for whatever reason
hey! do you know any elrond devs or a discord where i could join them? üôÇ
Ok... I will read the link... Thanks!
Read the link, exactly the same issue üôÇ
Which is a system instruction and thus not allowed to debit your program's accounts
`create_account`
And what instruction are you calling?
But it gives an error saying: `failed to verify account 2fVxUmK9M5QBdfpN8g7prZT8oo4aZ4zWdKrKWaB6Q8dR: instruction spent from the balance of an account it does not own`
Where `6KC3p8oAqLTjHuTMvz3Tdb2tMDVZ1GQYGC1RiZfRQRN` is our program
Check this log: `keyed_accounts: [KeyedAccount { is_signer: true, is_writable: true, key: 2fVxUmK9M5QBdfpN8g7prZT8oo4aZ4zWdKrKWaB6Q8dR, account: RefCell { value: Account { lamports: 100000000 data.len: 0 owner: 6KC3p8oAqLTjHuTMvz3Tdb2tMDVZ1GQYGC1RiZfRQRN executable: false rent_epoch: 0 }`
Which is a normal runtime rule, nothing specific about CPI.  You just have to do some contortions to fulfill the requirement with CPI
Yeah, but that is what I do...
Yeah you should be able to, the funding account just needs to be owned by the program debiting it
Ok, let me have a look
I think you need to follow this from like... 30min ago. https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/897580171211718706
But... Then... Is there any way to pay for a CPI invocation that requires a funding account, other than the "user" how signed the transaction?
Check üôÇ
Ah, usually call that the "funding account"
Yeah I understand, but that only works if you sell something... If you only want then to pay 0.00005 (pure transaction costs) that's not an option
Well for example if you create an account it asks for a `from_pubkey` that is used to pay for the rent needed for that account. I would like to be able to provide a key here other then the key used by the user who called our contract (signed the transaction is the wallet)
so payer sends 1 sol, we confirm it has 1 sol, we make new accounts w rent paying w/ his wallet, lets say it costs .3 sol, and then we transact 1 sol - (total rent costs) to say "we paid for the rent"
You don't, the program calls them for you.  Your transaction will only include the outer instruction's accounts/data
but the payer still pays the flat fee totally
in my program I subtract the fees for rent from the finalized transaction so we "eat" the cost by actually making it cheaper for the payer
I'm not sure I understand what you're talking about by "payer account".  Are you talking about something other than transaction fees?
<@!585868308419444749> so is there any way to pay for a CPI invocation that requires a payer account, other than the "user" how signed the transaction? We have a case where we actually want to pay the rent for opening a few accounts and let the user only pay for the transaction costs itself (so ex the rent)
Programs don't account for transaction fees, runtime does
findprogramaddress for the meta account and getaccountinfo
yeah man
that sounds right yeah. do you know how one would decode and extract the metadata from the token/mint
But I guess `signer` is a bit on an overloaded term then?
how do i include the inner instructions in a transfer instruction?
Confusing as the docs mention: 
```
While it has no private key of its own, it can be used by a program to issue an instruction that includes the Program address as a signer
```
there you have it
No, PDAs have no private key, thus can't actually sign the transaction.  They're a runtime facility
I think so, so long as the account has the lamports in it
If the PDA has insufficient funds I get an error saying so, but when I make sure it has enough funds I get `failed to verify account 2fVxUmK9M5QBdfpN8g7prZT8oo4aZ4zWdKrKWaB6Q8dR: instruction spent from the balance of an account it does not own`
Can you use a PDA as the payer for an CPI (using invoke_signed with the signer seeds of course)?
Get back in time?
I know you can read wallets in the past by checking in which blcoks they appear, but can I do something similar for programs??
don't quote me on this but you can probably use web sockets to listen to the current account for events, and if a transfer event happens, subscribe to the new account  
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#accountsubscribe
how do i go about inner instructions?
yep, and that program also has data in it, as you can see at the bottom. something to consider as well. good luck!
thanks, and the program id in this case would be the ``Program`` above account #1?
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#TransactionInstructionCtorFields pretty much
newbie NFT question. how would one detect NFT transfers if the mints are unique? 
I see that mints are owned by Metaplex program...
so i just have to use ``transaction.add(new web3.TransactionInstruction({})`` and include the public keys?
Can you in any way read the data of a program at a previous point in time??
Hi everyone!  Does anyone know why this isn't merging?  https://github.com/solana-labs/ecosystem/pull/410
what do you mean? you see the program id right there and all the accounts passed in
if an instruction is unknown, how am i able to reproduce it with web3?
Good call
Nice.  Probably going to need `features = [ no_entrypoint ]` or w/e to prevent symbol collisions upon compilation
Cool , I was able to import it from cargo.  ``` spl-associated-token-account = "*" ``` in my .toml
You can read blockchain data for free. Just not insert data for free. Thanks to Solana fee model though, it's way cheaper.
I haven't looked too deeply into that yet
yeah and I think there'd be a network fee associated because afaik there is no free 'reading' like there is on eth but I might be wrong(?)
Worst case, copy-pasta your way to victory
Maybe?  I only learned that we'd factored that out when digging it up for you.  Probably doesn't really make sense for that to live in token program any more TBH
Thank you! I didn't want to attach a smart contract without a purpose. That wouldn't be smart engineering üòÑ
üí™
Aha, interesting. I guess I didn't think of 0% as a royalty amount. That could work
and the artist(s) would split the royalties
yeah the creatros array is a vec of creators, so while you're not the 'author' of the art, you could list yourself as a creator anyway to designate yourself as one of the creators. you can mark a creator to receive 0 royalties, so on mint you'd do that
Sweet , I can just import that module and call that function ?
Hopefully that makes sense.
What if I am trying to keep track of NFTs created on the platform but I am not one of the creators? Basically I am trying to see if there is any way to filter NFTs sitting in someone's wallet and tell a difference as to whether they were created on my platform or a third-party platform.
if the NFT has meta data, you're going to want to use the 'creators' array
You can't use `create_account` due to the order of operations.  I'd suggest cribbing from the SPL ATA Program, https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/1c417ffa4f9874a8df43a39746a790224421b13b/associated-token-account/program/src/tools/account.rs#L13
Hi all, I am trying to figure out if there is a way to identify if any NFT was created on my platform that lets you mint NFTs. One way I thought of was attaching an simple ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù smart contract and see if that is attached to the NFT. Is that the right approach or am I way off?
Am I going down the correct path in creating a PDA inside my program ? There seems to be allot of ways to create an account . I'm just using the create_account instruction and sending it to invoke . ``` 
        let new_master_trove_ix = create_account(
            &initializer.key,
            &initializer.key,
            Rent::default().minimum_balance(trove_default_data.len()),
            std::mem::size_of_val(&trove_default_data)
                .try_into()
                .unwrap(),
            &program_id,
        );
        invoke(
            &new_master_trove_ix,
            &[
                initializer.clone(),
                AccountInfo::new(
                    &new_master_trove_key,
                    true,
                    false,
                    &mut Rent::default().minimum_balance(trove_default_data.len()),
                    trove_default_data.borrow_mut(),
                    &program_id,
                    false,
                    Epoch::default(),
                ),
            ],
        );
```
in general, what are best practices to debug this?
i'm trying to do CPI to create a metadata account, and I'm getting `<acct>'s writable privilege escalated`, despite fact that `<acct> signer: true writable: true`. the account in question is in fact the wallet signer
this is why we'll win
sol is such an autistic blockchain to program on, love it
dont have on devnet :/
when i called getBalance i have a cors error
there is a trick with solana main net and cors?
Thank you man, really helped me a lot
Well, the entire account size is set a creation time. You have to make it additive because I'm sure there is other data being written to the account, but check with the metaplex'ers
Yes I will ask on their discord
as we would do in C with type array[SIZE]
I do not but I think there is a metaplex discord channel if you scroll up in this window a ways
Can I set a fixed size ?
Thnaks man ! I don't see where the total size requested is written, do you know candy machine program ?
the 'program owner' is generally a BPFLoader, of sorts, right? if you mean program address, the address should be passed into the program.
here is some reading material:
https://docs.solana.com/terminology#bpf-loader
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts#ownership-and-assignment-to-programs
borsh docs:
https://docs.rs/borsh/0.9.1/borsh/
yeah, this is what I noticed too. I'm working on sample code right now
It is possible, yes. As long as you have the data allocated to hold your worst case size
The SDK code doesn't seem to support the claims. https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/instruction.rs#L311-L328
Yes, sorry for the missing details. It is for a program (I'm forking metaplex candy machine to add a whitelist feature (so a vector of authorized addresses). I wanted to know if it was possible for me to add a field of this type in the data structure of the program account data.
Can you provide sample code? (pastebin or gist, please)
With enough time and money, anything is possible! üôÇ
Maybe you can add some color to your question: Is this in a program? Program account data?
Hello, is it possible to declare a field with the vector of address type ? (please mention me)
Do you mean solana_sdk/solana_program? I was using solana_program and reading AccountMeta off of instruction. I just tried it using solana_sdk and have the same issue.
You're using the Rust SDK?
Got a question about some weird behavior I am experiencing in rust tests. I am constructing the accounts for my Instruction using `AccountMeta`. But I've noticed that on some accounts it doesn't matter if I use `new` or `new_readonly`. The `is_writable` field is always `true`. Does anyone know what could be causing this?
I wanted a list of addresses. With a counter associated with each. So i did create a struct for it and in another struct I created its Vec<first struct >. Kind of give me what I want in theory. But issue now arising would be passing an array of structures from the web3 side.  Can you kindly point  me to some proper in depth documentation of borsh?
Can anyone please tell me that is it possible to get the address of the owner of the deployed program in rust contract?
<#837340113067049050> channel is good for these types of questions
Hey all, a question about RPC servers. Can an RPC server restrict traffic to only one webserver? and if so how would we go about implementing that on the RPC side
these questions are better suited for the metaplex discord:
https://discord.gg/Me8kM7dC
Hi all. I'm back again with more basic questions. This time around NFTs and Metaplex. If anyone is familiar would super appreciate some pointers!

- If I want to create a collection of NFTs (100 unique images, 10 copies of each). I would have 100 mints with supply of 10? Would we have 1000 accounts to store them or 100? When a user try to mint an NFT would we try to transfer the token to their account or updateAuthority and give the token account to the user? 

- Another question: can child of a MasterEdition mint have different custom metadata? If I want to have a NFT without limit in supplies, but each time it has slightly different metadata would that be possible?
ah fantastic thank you

Hello, is it possible to mint packs of NFTs on Solana? I am looking to imitate pack drops similar to WAX. Interested in learning if we can allow collectors to craft and burn some NFTs as well
Hi team, I understand this is right place for Dev support. I am working on one of use case for NFT (bulk processing) and going to adopt Solana plate for the use case. May I ask someone for little guidance?
is there a standard amount of decimals when creating an spl token? and how do I change those decimals?
Where is solana data stored?? A PDA can have data associated with it, where is that data stored?? Any article that explains that so that I can understand those concepts better is welcomed! üôÇ
Yes correct, its just not obvious to me what the schema is precisely to deserialize it properly in this case
Given this: https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/rust/metaplex/program/src/state.rs
I would contend the additional programs are using borsh as well
I am building on Solana and want to use a service like The Graph for querying data this is currently available on Solana, does anyone know a good tool that is available?
Yeah got you. It's metaplex related so ive moved my question there and slowly trying to work through it
As <@!590982495923732511>  said but deserializing using Borsh is fine if that is what was used to serialize the data to that buffer. However; there are other schemes that may be used. Your best bet is to find the source code of the program itself to see how storage is structured and serialized.
Am figuring it out slowly.
No not really.
Btw have you used metaplex before?
Oh alright lol
Oh that is a joke used by engineers.
It means you have pixies interfering with your PC, causing weird behaviour.
What does that mean?
<@!123840384857014272> 
Solana only knows how to decode a few types of account data.
For custom accounts you need to know the structure of the data and decode it your self using Borsh.
How do I decode the AccountInfo returned from connection.getParsedAccountInfo? The data returned from that function isn't actually parsed, its just a buffer
The program works with small r images it fails with larger images, is there anything I can do to make it work further? It runs out of memory after generating only 10 images and I need about 7k
Hey ik this is not Solana related but I'm hoping someone here has exp with Node, I'm having a  memory issue when I am creating and writing large images into the file system using canvas API
Yes.
Hey, i'm looking for alternative method of getAccountInfo for get multiple account infos, getMultipleAccounts did is same job ?
https://tenor.com/view/rick-and-morty-ahh-yeah-getschwifty-gif-9764564
The pixies are busy today.
I changed to devent and it suddenly worked
actually you can only use a PDA to do it
I can give you 2 option to do it

- create a PDA and create token account for that PDA.
or
- create a PDA and init the PDA as a token account
can i withdraw token from that address if owner is my program ?
what can i do if i intialize account of token with owner my program
I'll try just calling the api directly too, instead of trying to use the web3 wrapper
yea, i checked that, docs are quite sparse.  i'm surprised i havent found a basic "display a wallet balance" type tutorial despite some searching. i'll continue searching github for something similar.. thanks for trying to help
It can be helpful to filter by `Fetch/XMLHttpRequest`.
But here is the API:
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getaccountinfo
should the code i posted work theoretically ? is there perhaps some different way to wrap the address ? alternatively, could you point me to any resources / examples which do something similar ?
thanks, yea on above link it shows the account balance etc. checked the dev console but couldnt really figure out the exact request thats pulling the balances
Thank you for your help
(with devnet)
Can you try again?
Strange.

I ran a cli command (solana stakes -u mainnet-beta) . I saw below information. I did not see any deactive Stake information. Does this mean that deactive stake is 0 ? where can I check deactive stake information of all validator ?
It works with mainnet-beta
I will try now
In fact you pre sale all your nft and maybe more and you make a random selection when the release date comes.
Hmm.
Can you try connecting to testnet or mainnet-beta?
This one

Sorry I thought I typed it in
Like specific ones or a random one?
So you want to sell NFTs before they are released?
Thank you, I mean that you sale your nft before the release date.
Sorry, which error?
Thanks
But today it's happening again and I can't fix it. Any ideas?
Yesterday I had this as well and I closed the terminal and fixed ti

Can you clarify what you mean by a presales contract?
Hi.
Hello everyone,
Can somebody tell me if it is possible to build a presale smart contract  and maybe guide me to a git link or article that would help. I have been searching for a long time now and can‚Äôt find help.
Thank you for your help.
If you open DevTools (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I`) then you should be able to see the network requests to the API.
Can you verify the address on https://explorer.solana.com/ ?
Thanks, I was going to try this out on devnet just to see, but it looks like it errors out, but there is an option to allow the sender to fund creation: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/671590dd056ea6e454e83017cba246b5bc010e2e/token/cli/src/main.rs#L629

hi there, very basic question - i'm trying to read out token etc balances from a liquidity pool, havent found many examples and the docs seem rather sparse (if anyone could point me to some, that would be amazing). ive tried to get started with the solana example code , calling getAccountInfo to see what that gives, but it just seems to give null even for existing addresses. could someone tell me what i'm doing wrong ?
Unless I am mistaken, the token is lost (burned).
Hello all. Does anyone here have any experience with creating "Nested" (or Composable) NFTs? 
Basically, an NFT which owns/contains other NFTs...
I have experience with implementing this sort of thing on Ethereum, and while I know Solana is a very different programming paradigm, I'm really hoping it's possible to implement this pattern in some way.
Does anybody know what happens if you initiate a transfer of a token to a wallet address that doesn't yet have an associated token account?
ty bru
> This timestamp is calculated as the stake-weighted median of timestamp estimates provided by votes, bounded by the expected time elapsed since the start of the epoch.
I couldn't find anything else on the timestamp in docs. But I have a time based contract and I wonder whether `timestamp` is the same in a single transaction? So you could first call an instruction to update it, and later call an instraction you need, all in a single transaction
Hello. How do you wrap more?
that's the best place to go, not being short. üòá
Go to the Metaplex Discord
Hi, does someone have a tuto or a github about program which would create NFT with IPFS hosting ? üôÇ
hello everyone. pretty new to smart contracts in general. Want to double check if i got my concepts right.

In my instruction, I want to have a counter account that I will only allow to increment if the caller wallet has a particular token minted from MintA with a balance of > 1. 

Could I enforce this by passing in:
```
1. The token account of a token minted under MintA
2. authority (signer)
3. counter account - a 'authorityMint' field that contains MintA
```
and enforcing
```
1. The token account's owner field has to equal the authority's key (wallet address)
2. The token account's mint has to equal counter account's authortiyMint field
3. The token account's amount is > 0
```?
makes sense! so, <@!888157046636183612>  probably ignore what i said about it being a problem with the datatypes on your end, but still good practice to make sure you're using the right bitsizes anyways lol
So, 100 trillion may be a wee to big for minting üôÇ But I'll let the program library core developers shine a light there
In this case 'Overflow' error refers to TokenError::Overflow and can be seen in the MintTo instruction of the spl-token program: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L488
Probably generated from the `checked_add` in https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/21f8af34e7dac77ba60b1821a7d30ede53387fae/libraries/math/src/precise_number.rs
makes sense
i'm not the right person to ask, you'll have to ask around for that, but i don't think using the same wallet matters. as long as interactions within your programs are dependent on the nft and the token, it should work regardless of what wallet you use to associate with the nft mints and game currency mint. that being said, it's probably best practice to do it with the same wallet so the more DYOR-type people who are interested in your project would know that that's the developer wallet, following the principle of transparency.
not sure of pros/cons or if it would even matter?
say i create an nft project. The nft's will be able to be used in a game. There will also be a token, a currency used in the game.

Mint everything on same wallet or separate for some reason?
can you be a bit more clear on the "would you mint the nfts on the same wallet as the token axie?" part?
here's a question I really don't know who to ask. Let's say if I was the dev of axie infinity. A game with nfts. Would you mint the nfts on the same wallet as the token axie? or would you use separate wallets?
ah i see
overflow implies that somewhere, some binary operation resulted in an output outside the bits allocated for the datatype you're using. might wanna make sure that you're using the right unsigned integer size (like u8, u64, etc.)
btw, "No default signer found" when I try to do "solana blanace".. what does that really mean?
ah ok thanks!
ok, I haven't studied the code but that suggests a cap
Right, I'm pointing out what error `0xe` is from the spl-token program. However; I'm not sure why or what that error is in relationship to you doing your mint. I'm not aware of any constraints on the number of tokens you can mint...
999 million worked
overflow?
hmm not sure what that means sorry¬†<@!814228493302497301>
Well, 0xe is 14 and the 14th error enum value is: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/error.rs#L59

But I'm not familiar with the logic
yes
using the `spl-token mint`?
can anyone please tell me how can i get all token owned by a program?
hi Im getting my feet wet right now and decided to follow the paulx escrow tutorial, but wanna add a challenge. instead of a user canceling a transaction, I'd like the program to send the tokens back after a set amount of time. for example, if Alice sends her token and bob doesn't send within 24 hrs, the escrow is canceled and the tokens are returned to Alice. what would be the best way to do this? as far as I understand, a program can call another program but there seems to be no way to schedule a transaction/instruction onchain, so therefore I'd have to have an offchain client call the program to initiate the cancellation, correct?
I'm trying to mint 100 trillion tokens but it gives me error:
RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0xe [5 log messages]

anything specific I need to do first?
Ah ok nice
So, mint the max you want then disable further minting
I believe so. Check out the section: https://spl.solana.com/token#example-create-a-non-fungible-token
Is there any way to set a hard max supply from the beginning? or is that just something the devs need to keep as a promise?
I see, thanks <@!814228493302497301>
Don't know if you read through to the Operational Overview: https://spl.solana.com/token#wrapping-sol
<@814228493302497301> thank you I was confused about the concepts
https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide
The short answer is No. What Solana programs 'own' are accounts that are typically signed and funded by a wallet.
I have a noob question. What's the meaning of doing this? Wrapping sol in a token?
Hi everyone, is it possible for a Solana program to own a wallet? If so, how can I do that? Every response would be helpful for me :))
after uploading using candy machine cli on metaplex. sorry if wrong place to post
Hi! Is there a Golang SDK which has program deployment implemented?
you can store data. 10mb is the max account size.  `solana rent <size>` can show cost.
what is this?
i'm stuck in processing loop and it never ends. not sure if i should force close it or not.
what to do about this error?

is it feasible to store a bunch of metadata in a Solana contract? I see NFTs use Arweave to store Metadata, but afaik, this sacrifices on-chain composability? Say I want to create a lookup table on-chain, would I be able to store that data? The goal would be able to pass in an NFT id and retrieve the attributes associated with that NFT?
and updated config after that as Katrik mentioned.

I've typed:

Thanks, that was one of steps. But also prior to that I've updated path, as solana command did not work
I don't think it is possible on native token program.
Token program allow anyone to create any token account.

I think maybe you can use something like whitelist to achieve what you want.
The main idea is that you make a program and You use its PDA as valid token accounts.
It can make you to do: 
1. only your account (contract owner) can create PDA and init it as a token account
2. your system just check is it a valid PDA.

this mechanism still can't ban other to create a token account for your token.
but you can check is the token account you created.
https://forums.solana.com/t/token-account-creation-restriction/3018 please help with this if you know answer.
You need to set the config URL like.
For example, for devnet
`solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com`
Hi everyone,

We need to update our URL from our GitHub URL to our website URL: https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/1303/checks?check_run_id=3737696188

could someone please guide me in direction How To Run it

Hey Guys. I've just tried to run "hello world" example
read this
https://2501babe.github.io/posts/solana101.html
i think the biggest challenge you're going to face is unlearning things you've learned previously. also i  encourage feedback
but just to be clear you can't write them in solidity
you can write solana programs (smart contracts) and deploy them to solana
what do you mean "directly in"
thanks, chase!
they are extremely helpful
https://discord.gg/hvWPVhCU
this belongs in anchor discord
DMs open
since i still believe this isn't necessarily related to solana core protocol and programs, but rather opinions on implementation
<@!776983677862281266> happy to move this to dms
assuming it's not a stable coin where tokens might need to be minted and burned
(for the most part)
with tokens, the approach is to mint a token and remove update and mint authority
lol we own the token program, but we do not dictate how things should be done with NFTs
I'll ask on the Metaplex discord, but I'm taking bets now that they're just going to say ‚ÄòSolana owns the token program; go ask them‚Äô üôÇ
Hello, I'm trying to wrap my head around the MintTo instruction in Anchor. I have a Mint whose mint_authority is account1, derive a PDA for my program with 
        let (_pda, nonce) = Pubkey::find_program_address(&[&ctx.accounts.account1.key().to_bytes()], ctx.program_id);
and structure the relevant seeds (for later input into mint_to) into a var signer, and then create a new CpiContext with
let cpi_ctx = CpiContext::new_with_signer(cpi_program, cpi_accounts, signer);
where cpi_program=ctx.accounts.token_program.clone(); and cpi_accounts = token::MintTo {
            mint: ctx.accounts.mint.to_account_info(),
            to: ctx.accounts.token.to_account_info(),
            authority: ctx.accounts.account1.to_account_info().clone(),
        };

I was under the impression that find_program_address would create the given address and the seeds would provide new_with_signer with the information necessary for the program to sign the accounts when they're passed to the token program, but I'm getting a "Cross-program invocation with unauthorized signer or writable account" error. Does anybody have insight into what I'm doing wrong/what is causing this error?
it is for sure not the core solana team
i do not disagree that that someone should make this clear, but it would be the team at meatplex who responible for setting these standards
But there might be more to the story, and that's why I came here to ask.
If the two approaches are _truly_ identical (authority change vs. opening/closing accounts) then someone should tell Digital Eyes that they're burning compute for nothing üôÇ
regarding nfts
not necessarily metaplex, but how these projects are handling how they deal with these decisions
it's really a matter of opinion and i don't have a strong one since with tokens and core spl is quite clear
Again, this doesn't really have anything to do with Metaplex. Digital Eyes and Magic Eden can decide to implement secondary market sales however they want, right?
but in general, these are stil more related to nft standards set my metaplex
(Doesn't completely erase it, but adds a hop in the chain)
<@!706224786602197073> is pretty imbedded in the nft space and can probably help you with some of this
I suppose the one advantage to opening a new account and closing the old one, is that effectively erases the history between owners. Does that maybe play a factor in which approach to choose?
actually when it comes to tokens in general, there is standard. nft projects seem to be doing whatever they want
That's for sure! If Solana had a strong opinion that authority swaps weren't the right way to transfer tokens, they wouldn't have implemented a Set Authority instruction.
a the core of this, metaplex is young, and nft standards haven't had time to mature. metaplex team is trying to get everyone on the same page but not everyone is listening
but this sort of question is more related to implementation and person opinion.
i've seen multiple questions around this.
the answer is that there isn't a standard for this. and i agree. everyone seems to be doing it differnetly.
Why would one marketplace choose to take one approach, and another marketplace choose the other. It seems that the second option is more compute-intensive.
What is the core question
My question is: what are the relative merits of one approach over the other.

1. Transfer a token by changing the authority on the existing associated token account
2. Transfer a token into a new associated token account and close the old one.
So you are mentioning marketplaces
Ok
The programs in question are the core SPL token programs though.
NFTs in general
This is about token transfer patterns generally.
This isn't about Metaplex.
https://discord.gg/metaplex
Those go in metaplex discord
Just FYI Solana core team doesn‚Äôt support NFTs or metaplex
Digital Eyes, on the other hand, opens a new account for the new owner, and closes the account of the old owner. Example: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4ve3pnNMPpv4nSgxhT8FcvtbzPX2iqo7C9hss1BopZmRvEJbU1tik8GeMApUnmjtP9Dn4YJNhNeAwfipW7jPK8xb
Magic Eden transfers tokens by setting the authority on the associated token account to the new owner. Example: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/JHcdDfUTuvLTyE9Egvw8MK94KiX5yCmg8S9QSocPbu7a92E1XPVC56CU4tyHiSNiLQw3JU7h4Fd6d4ah1YXZSFP
I've noticed that different NFT marketplaces implement token sales differently.
So basically I initialize and set authority for then I can mint a unique token?
What would be the best way to monitor a contract program for specific instructions?
every token has a mint, the only distinction is the supply and the number of decimals.
you don't need to, spl-token is already deployed. It's not like EVM where you need to deploy your own erc20 or whatev, the spl-token is the basic program that handles all fungible and non-fungible tokens on Solana
Is there a github project implementing tokens in rust?
Yeah thats definitely something I could help with too and I would love to!
there's so much demand they really don't have time to focus on documentation, so help there would probably be appreciated.
it's bugged, so yea, I would head there first.
I actually didn't know that, that makes me feel much better about it
I'm using a boilerplate of they're candy-machine right now but i just keep breaking things trying to do what i want
It's Solana-funded core devs
Okay awesome, I'm gonna head over there now.
You need to checkout the Metaplex project and join their Discord. They have office hours on Thursday I believe.
checking it out now!
Yeah exactly, I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to build a simple NFT viewer to start off with.
You can also search the channel for `NFT`.
This gist describes how to get metadata from a metaplex token:
https://gist.github.com/dvcrn/c099c9b5a095ffe4ddb6481c22cde5f4
By tokens I assume you mean NFTs?
Thanks dude!

I‚Äôm really just struggling to fine documentation for interacting with tokens via the JS API. I‚Äôve followed numerous links to pages for documentation and examples that just end in a 404. 

Any help or even just a nudge in the right direction is greatly appreciated!
Hey guys! Adding a good IRL friend of mine. He's a very talented dev and is eager to build on Solana. He's hitting a wall with something so I told him you guys were the best ever and would help him out. <@!265256084556480513>
What was the fix here? You were using <@347689664855015424>'s module as well?
Hi, what was the fix in your error with the undeclared crate? I
cargo clean isn't doing the trick either

hmm, that didnt' seem to fix. Updated the cli and bump cargo.toml. still not seeing it
oh, they're mismatched, 1.6.9 and crate has 1.7.11
what SDK version are you using?
Hi guys, any Solana devs interested in joining the Immortalis team in assisting in technical aspects (web 3 integration). Compensation will be discussed privately!
Any way to burn NFTs? when I issue the `spl-token burn <TOKEN_ACCOUNT>` it says it has burned the token, but the max supply in the explorer still shows 1 instead of 0. When I go to the distribution tab is says 0, but why does it not say 0 also on the max supply?
I realize this is a noob question, I'm trying to run PaulX's tutorial and getting `use of undeclared crate or module 'solana_sdk'`, even though ti's right in the Cargo.toml file
Does anyone have a good pattern for registering your wallet as the 'admin' for a program?

My idea right now is to give the program an 'initialize' method, where it creates its own state account at a PDA, but fails on subsequent calls if the state account already exists.

But it would be good to know if anyone has already done this, or has a working example
Using rx swift
But is not latest latest version

Is solana aware of any apps building on ajamaica's sdk?
If you need support just let me know
<@214485183989022721>
With an amazing developer
This is the most complete
https://github.com/ajamaica/Solana.Swift
is anyone using the swift api libraries? which one are you using
NeonLabs has a full team and community so probably the best option. Or learn rust üòÅ
yh, it's not yet complete .. some features still pending
yup, i have heard about this, dunno if this has an active community
sick
sicl
Full disclosure I don‚Äôt know anyone who has used this
also https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang
They are live on devnet and believe the mainnet is suppose to come this year
thanks, this might help
The closest options is EVM neonlabs.org but not live on mainnet yet
It is not
<@873417023470850069> something like this
myPub = new PublicKey(your string)

PublicKey.isOnCurve(myPub)
i dont see a recentBlockhash being set on the transaction? that might be crucial to the test.
btw, is there a service similar to thegraph for sol?
hi, a total noob question - "Is it possible to convert solidity smart contracts to rust smart contracts for a solana dapp?"
But agree
They don‚Äôt
yh, so ideally, every "query" method should have a "slot" option similar to ethereum https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-getBalance
You have to convert to a public key first
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/20743
I submitted a bug report here
yes, unless it doesn't get deserialized properly
Web3 has a function something like ‚ÄúisOnCurve‚Äù
anyone know how to see if a string is a valid solana address?
im not certain this is why, but in regards to the transaction, are you making sure the `recent_blockhash / recentBlockhash` is the same between partial sign/add signatures ? before and after
I might be wrong here but I personally haven‚Äôt seen this discussed
I think you would have to do some custom calculations to find the value
I don‚Äôt know any rpc method that offers the ability to grab account info directly at a certain point in time
say 1 month back. i've setup the archival node from quicknode btw..
How far back would you be looking ?
has anyone seen this before or knows of a workaround?
the issue there is that it looks like `partialSign/addSignature` don't work once a transaction has been serialized and deserialized. (I.e. you can't apply `partialSign` to a transaction that's been deserialized, it blows away all the existing signatures)
bump, in case any of the core/lib devs are here
I basically want to read the account data of a particular pubkey at a certain block..
block and slot related methods:  search on `block` and `slot`
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html
Of a tx or what?
I‚Äôm in my phone but search Solana-Keygen in this channel and you should find it
Nice. I've setup one. Now how do we go about targeting a certain slot/block? e.g. in `connection.getAccountInfo` ?
They use different derivation paths
How do I import a wallet created on sollet.io to solana-keygen?
Using `solana-keygen recover` results in a different public key than sollet.
kudos!
Thanks alot seems to work now!
Thanks alot let me try
did you update the distro and run update for packages?
`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
`sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang make`
yeah mine was from MS store
have you tried installing the 'ubuntu' distro from the microsoft store?
there should be many resources here:

Thanks alot it keeps saying failed to compile 'spl-token-cli v2.0.15'. I can't use the cli T.T
Thank you very much
i only know of this:  im not sure there is much more. i think unity is implementing .net 6 and then after, more support and features may come with the new .net upgrade. until then there is this: 
https://github.com/allartprotocol/unity-solana-wallet
Hello Everyone. Any resource/documentation apart from the SPL for learning more about how to create a custom token/nft with metadata from code (rust)? Thanks
I need to know how that works and if I can implement it into my mobile games.
I can‚Äôt even find a link but I know the unity SDK was made in August.
i dont believe there is a lot of information. there are lots of SDKs by the community. 
which sdk are you referring to, link?
did you try the `--verbose` / `-V`  flag to see if you get anymore information during spl-token-cli install?  
are you able to run any solana cli commands? ..though it just looks like dependencies off hand.
Hello everyone. I was sent back here. Lol. Can anybody explain to me how the Solana Unity SDK works? I guess i should start with that question. I can‚Äôt find any information about that on the Solana website. Thanks. To add, I‚Äôm coming from the kin blockchain/ecosystem community where the blockchain rewards it‚Äôs token based upon usage.
while installing spl cli
hmm I had tried but the same problem occurs üò¶
Please let me know if you need help, I would like to learn more about smart contract development.
Thank you so much mate!
thanks, ill take a look! really appreciate your input fren <a:widepeepoHappyRightHeart:742821206633480212>
The only reference to "history" in the docs was `SlotHistory` and `StakeHistory`, but I am not sure if either of them are useful.
https://docs.rs/solana-program/1.8.0/solana_program/slot_history/struct.SlotHistory.html
it looks like some dependencies may be missing. you could try rust install again, and or rust up. 
alternative instructions to get rust installed: then make sure path is setup.
https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/installation.html#install-rust
and alternatively use 1.8 
`sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.8.0/install)"`
and make sure you can run a cli command `solana address` and `path` is setup. in your env. then:
`cargo install spl-token-cli`
Hi may I know does anyone know how can I resolve this when I am installing spl cli on WSL?
I had installed rust and ran this command and this is what happened - cargo install spl-token-cli
‚ô•Ô∏è  thank you for the nice feedback!
this is awesome. like you how broke it down and ++ for showing add/deletes in code examples. ‚≠ê
Solana team there are multiple Swift API.  Is there an officially supported one?
ah :p
i see what you're saying though, makes a lot of sense to do that (and from what im seeing using a btreemap would cause more complications)
Nor am I üôÇ
where can i go about finding a developer versed in smart contracts? not sure to post here or not
i dont need to be spoonfed just need to be pointed in the right direction for things
do you have any reference documentation/rough pseudo code for this? sorry, im really not a blockchain dev so not too knowledgeable on all of this
That way you won't have to store any additional data on chain.
If it is >= the limit, reject the transaction.
When someone tries to mint a token, count how many they have already minted with the wallet.
Yes, I am referring to the on-chain program.
so then on-chain it'd check the mint history, see if X wallet has minted more than Y, and if so reject
im not too sure, in this case i'm planning to PR this upstream to metaplex as it'd be super handy, so i was thinking of adding a per wallet limit that's configurable
Won't it be easier/cheaper to check if a wallet contains a transaction for another NFT of the same type, and if so reject the transaction?
they dont seem to have a channel for rust questions like that
yeah i know they have a dedicated discord but i felt like this was more solana related than metaplex related üòÖ
Metaplex has a dedicated discord channel you can try
But FYI: Can't use `HashMap` but you can use `BTreeMap`
would a `std::collections::HashMap<Pubkey, u8>` be a solution here, or does that have conflicts with how solana works?
but im struggling to work out how best to store the mapping and use it, im not a rust dev so hoping someone can point me to some reference docs/examples/etc that would help me achieve this
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/rust/nft-candy-machine/src/lib.rs here's the file im looking at for reference, in theory it should be as simple as:
- store a mapping of pubkey -> number minted somewhere
- in the `mint_nft` function, check if mapping contains the wallet, and if so check if it's above a specific amount
- if they're above it, return an error code
- at the end of the `mint_nft` function, either add that wallet to the mapping (if its not already in the mapping) or increment the mapping
hey folks! i'm new to rust & solana, and trying to do what _should_ be a fairly simple addition to the metaplex candy machine smart contract

what i would like to do is set a limit per wallet, and to do that i need to be able to store a mapping of public key (or some other wallet identifier) to number minted

is there an existing class/structure i can use for this?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

is this good to save pda seed's to database
This isn't straight up a dev question so feel free to point me towards a better channel but does anyone know of good resources on how to correctly structure token incentives? right now any liquidity mining program that distributes inflationary rewards works to get initial liquidity but usually makes token price tank and the liquidity eventually leaving

Some protocols will require a lock-in period etc which I like but I wondered if there was guidance on this
for just the cli, you should just be able to `rm` the folder from solana/install path
no probs happy to help üòâ

Like `only try to return addresses if transaction contains 2 instructions, first one containing 2 inner instructions and second one containing 3`
You might need to verify that the transaction you are checking passes some conditional statements if there are different types of transactions going through that address where the account inputs don't contain your desired addresses.
<@!413379728553148418> 
in pseudo code it would look like this :
```
signatures = getSignaturesForAddress(swap account)
for signature in signatures getTransaction(signature) as transaction
    if transaction matches transaction template
        then return swap account owner and liquidity pool
```
Thanks a lot ser :D
Is there any way of confirming that program has not been updated?
I.e. I'm doing a cpi call to another program and I don't trust the authority of this program(worried that owner might update it with malicious intentions). I want to make sure that when the program authority updates it my cpi call would fail
<@!413379728553148418>
The third address is also present in the account inputs
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress
This means that using some RPC calls getSignaturesForAddress and getConfirmedTransaction you can deduce the second address
You can see that the second address is present in the account inputs of that transaction. I just clicked the first link and clicked the first transaction and it was there.
Check this
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/W4X8PFrUqRhTGsUh5nNCA58xM5dCEjjLbD9C4rYJbuhQJZuom9yvtE1csuTTMocCcDU8UwZLE7ZhUkQEF2i4XF1?cluster=mainnet-beta
i'd like to be able to get the second address (lp token address) using the first address ("swap account" address) and then get the liquidity pool address, tokenA and tokenB

https://explorer.solana.com/address/BkwbeSfcX1h4thMDd7obGkHrPevf3QwgzJ4pCEqG18Lu?cluster=mainnet-beta

Excuse me chat. Is there any package to connect a React App with the wallets on the Binance Smart Chain? Like Metamask, Trust, Math, Binance Wallet etc... ?
Are there any good examples out there of getting a connected wallets owned nfts? Like for setting up a ‚ÄúMy NFTs‚Äù page
Could you give an example of such an address ?
and it makes sense as this info would be in the program account's data, rather than that address actually owning the account
thx, this hint was valuable. found the info by using the getParsedAccountInfo call and the "owner" info is in value.data.parsed.info.owner
by swap account i mean address that's responsible for swapping in the liquidity pool
in java script
from the "swap account" address
is it possible to get a liquidity pool address, tokenA and tokenB
I'm a newbie dev and would appreciate some help
Hey i've tried to connect to a custom RPC node with web3. How can i verify i'm using this custom mode and not the default one ?
I've done this to connect : 
const connection = new web3.Connection(
    "https://mycustomnode.com/?apikey=myapiKey",
);
any help with this?
the owner of an account is a program, so your seeing the token program as the actual owner of the account. the authority if available should be what your expecting.   since the account is a token program account, you might be able to acces token.getAccountInfo instead.
it is solved thanks to <@!788215642070581289> 
turns out all you really need to do is just use the command
solana program deploy <Path to the .so file that you updated> --program-id the address of the program that you wan to upgrade.
How to get the owner of a token account? e.g.

https://solscan.io/account/5jMADhA8bLjGP8cbcvS6GyDnhh6ZELyK9SQCebw2i96E <-- owner is 426dxwrdp3iEnEBJmbFGvURE5vWVXA9BVrNo66oicc33

But if I do 

```
addr = new web3.PublicKey("5jMADhA8bLjGP8cbcvS6GyDnhh6ZELyK9SQCebw2i96E");
var acc = await connection.getAccountInfo(addr);
acc.owner.toBase58();
```

I get TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA, not 426dxwrdp3iEnEBJmbFGvURE5vWVXA9BVrNo66oicc33
i'll have to try to see if it is man..... dont know why i chose to do that...üëÄ
I'll bow out then, I don't have the knowledge to tell you definitively if it's possible.
this might be able to help me......
but the signer authority lies with my account
Oh, if you lost the keypair it's doubtful you can access the account at that address anymore. To my knowledge, program keypairs are randomly generated, otherwise anyone could access them.
so what i did was i foolish copied the .so file from  it's folder and didn't keep the keypair that is used for redeploying to the same address...... otherwise solana deploy program works great if you have the keypair that is generated with cargo build-bpf
^Second link is actually better, redeploy to the same address with cli
https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program#redeploy-a-program
https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/1.8.0/solana_sdk/loader_upgradeable_instruction/enum.UpgradeableLoaderInstruction.html#variant.Upgrade
if so i would like to know how as kind of messed some things up
is there anyway possible to redeploy a program to it's already deployed address???
yeah that's interesting, not really sure what it accomplishes either
Can you send a runnable example?
The trace is 
```
sign
sign_partial
serialize_message
compile_message
```
pretty much it looks like this :
```
transaction = Transaction()
instruction = TransactionInstruction(list_of_account_metas, program_address, program_data)
transaction.add(instruction)
transaction.recent_blockhash = get_recent_blockhash()
transaction.sign(my_key)
```
The last statement is where it fails
Can you send your code?
yeah it's solana python sdk
This is related to the specific library you are using, not Solana itself.
Yep
Are you using python?
This happens when I try to sign a transaction, it fails to compile message
Good to see it's fixed.
Thanks.
Btw does anyone know where this error comes from ? I'm trying to send my first transaction and am a bit stumped
```
line 137, in compile_message account_metas.extend(instr.keys) TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
```
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/17758
Ah.
I believe I saw this in a github issue
I can make a good guess of which operating system was used based on the path structure. The memo program appears to be compiled on a Mac.
I know the username of the account used, which is often the same as online handles.
In this case, <@!213083996689661953>
For example, I know the solana library version, which can help me pin roughly when the program was compiled based on the release date of the version.
Not only is this a waste of memory, it also leaks a surprising amount of information.
From the memo program (https://spl.solana.com/memo)

Is it a known issue that the compilation process embeds filesystem paths into on-chain programs?
is it possible for me to do so or solana only allows one account to subscribeAccount event at a time ?
I want to look over the deposit of the any account to do so i got to know about the method accountSubscribe method which is websocket method according to the solana RPC documentation .... i am able to get the events for the single account at a time but i want to subscribe more than one account to know if there is any transaction done on the public address
Unless there is another program (on or off chain) that is listening for these transactions, does the breeding logic and transfers the child to the correct (payer's) wallet.
I don't see what is accomplished by that.
So it seems like the website is taking 1 SOL into an account, then calling the memo program?
`BreedGgFkni3g1kVQajqFfTNSfyBorabZckSHaGw63hN` seems to be a normal account (not executable)
`MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr` is the Memo program (https://spl.solana.com/memo)
I found this code from https://solanimals.com/
```js
      const transaction = new Transaction().add(
        SystemProgram.transfer({
          fromPubkey: walletPublicKey,
          toPubkey: new PublicKey('BreedGgFkni3g1kVQajqFfTNSfyBorabZckSHaGw63hN'),
          lamports: 1000000000,
        })
      );

      transaction.add(
        new TransactionInstruction({
          keys: [{ pubkey: walletPublicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true }],
          data: Buffer.from(parents.parent0.id + ' ' + parents.parent1.id, 'utf8'),
          programId: new PublicKey('MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr'),
        })
      );

      const signature = await sendTransaction(transaction, connection);
```
Although I could not find any implementation details anywhere.
There seems to be a project https://solanimals.com/ that has a breeding mechanic.
I too would be interested in knowing the answer to this.
For example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/68995589/7370354
Not sure, but you can use `@project-serum/sol-wallet-adapter` without react from https://unpkg.com/@project-serum/sol-wallet-adapter@0.2.6/dist/cjs/index.js
Hello,

We are working on to launch new spl token that could be traded. We have mobile application which has users and we want to give those tokens to those users. Can you please suggest how to give initial value to our token.is there any practice or standard method to define like 1 token=0.000001 USD
Does anybody know if the https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter can be used on a Vanilla website (i.e. without using React or Next?)
No, not necessary. Feel free to remove!

Okayy, damn so hard to figure out then? I just need to trust the team blindly?
Is borsh serialization faster than clone?
or would you have to recreate it as a derivative on-chain version
bumping my question from earlier: does anyone have any ideas on how to approach putting NFT attributes that are on Arweave onto Solana? NFT was created with Metaplex and afaik, this doesn't really allow it to be composable since the actual attributes aren't on-chain - a Solana program can't interact with them. The first solution I could think of is manually putting them all on-chain by creating accounts for them and a PDA using the original mint authority + the NFT # but I'm not sure if it's reasonable to create thousands of accounts like that. Those Accounts would just be readonly though and just exist as a way to read attributes on-chain
Good point... there is not certification/governance process... yet üôÇ
Let's say I have access to their GitHub repo
How do we verify the same code is being deployed as GitHub tho?
... its a hassle
You can certainly read the byte stream of the program, you can even disassemble to BPF but ....
If you can't find the code source I would be cautious using it if at all
So, Rust Programs gets compiled to BPF which is the byte code loaded up with the deployment of the program
At this time there is no 'translators' back to Rust to support that in the explorer or other
why can't we read it from the solana blockchain?
but what if the project doesnt publish the code on their github repo?
You'd have to read the code vis-a-vis a public repository (e.g. github, etc.)
is there a way a general user could read through the contract code of a smart contract on solana? I've had no luck finding it
One last question: What RPC URL does you config have?
Thanks you‚Äôre kind
hmm... at a loss, maybe when support or core developers arrive they may shed a light
Yes same result
what happens when you add the keypair to the command (e.g. `solana balance --keypair path/xxx.json` - where `xxx` is your keypair filename)? Same result?
Im sure my json file already have one
No default signer found, run "solana-keygen new -o Stuff/my-keypair.json" to create a new one
Yes it returns this
and do you get an error back?
Earlier It can tell balance with only that command
Solana balance
how are you invoking the balance command
Like It cant tell the balance, and I cant transfer as well
So, that shows you a keypair... what is it you are trying to do with it?
It tell the right keypair but again I cant do anything with that
`solana config get` may help.
I use Teminal in macos to create a wallet, but when I turn off Teminal I cant find the Keypair I created before (it said no defaut signer found). What should I do to find my keypair?
Okay cool
External backend
So is this within the smart contract on chain or would it be using an external backend?
Does each NFT part of the same collection require a different token account?
Program 5A25ujYbEqtQs3hAm3B4XmUAfUVBvt6rMuP5Hh7ByzBD failed: incorrect program id for instruction
(node:20704) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: incorrect program id for instruction


what could this mean in as i'm sending the correct program ID
 return new TransactionInstruction({
        keys,
        programId: programId,
        data
    });
that's awesome
I think in the web3 these are `on....` where you can provide the callback function.
You can subscribe to monitor an account and get an event whenever `lamports` or `data` change
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#accountsubscribe
Yeah. It would be owner % from NFT sales so would be from external source
Just to be clear, the 'payment to an address' is not going through your program to begin with?
Heya. Is there a way to automatically trigger a function in a smart contract on payment to an address owned by the program? I want to have an address that pays out to a bunch of other addresses whenever it receives payment. Thanks in advance helpful people!!
the list goes on
like the staking on raydium or orca
is there any example in the solana-prgoram-library for single sided staking

Hi <@!426850769162076164> this seems metaplex related.
I see you asked a similar question on the metaplex discord, do you want to continue the discussion there?
how does that work on solana? on ethereum it isn't this way
How does a wallet like Phantom automatically add a random token received by the account?
Will do so once I get back to it... üòÖ For now working on other things
hey
Is there any tutorial on how to create an NFT with a media file associated? On the official docs there is only a tutorial on how to create it, not how to link an image or video
anyway that doesnt answer my question üôÇ
cause of serum
i dont think thatll be a problem on solana
Gotta be careful with that to discourage the swap hype we had on BSC a while back üí¶
is there any open source solana token-swap frontends around?
since https://github.com/project-serum/oyster-swap is dead
hey guys

`solana rent <size>`
How much is rent on solana
Hi
Coinmarketcap API works decently well and has a decent free tier but be sure to filter down to Solana projects only - turns out there are overlapping symbols in some of the ethereum projects that will get returned from Coinmarketcap

0x means insufficient funds the most common case being you don't have enough Solana to make the transaction. In my experience though that error also showed up when I had the "payer" account mixed up for the market pair I was trying to transact (would try using the other associated token address of the pair to see if it fixes the issue). No idea how to better debug those issues other than googling like hell and asking here unfortunately though would be happy to learn otherwise.
does anyone know what kind of error this is likely to be? also how can i better debug such error messages?
```
failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x12f
```
thanks üëçüèª
https://pyth.network/
https://coinmarketcap.com/api/
also I don't have access to  <#842479735975968818>
maybe I misunderstand your problem. but the idea is that
if your address hold token, you have a token account
and if you want to transfer/receive token, you need a token account
ok thanks.. can u share any documents url if possible
seems you want to retrieve some tokens price right? 
if you in web3 maybe you can integrate some other services like coinmarketcap 
if you on chain, you can use pyth oracle to fetch token price.
but once I create that token account I don't have to move the NFTs I already have at my initial wallet?
`spl-token create-account --help` can help you to create a token account
Anyhow I could retrieve metadata of nft from using the json api? Thanks
so we're facing the same problem right?
but first we must move tokens from the initial account to the spl account
`spl-token accounts --owner your-sol-address` will help you find all token accounts you already have
`spl-token account-info you-token-address` will help you find mint of token account
yes i know - im saying i need to figure out how to get the token account ID while minting using candy machine cli rather than viewing each TX hash
i didn't get you..
when you use mint_one_token it gives you the tx hash I reckon
solana is just the token transfer
so probs will direct my questions there
this is more of a metaplex thing though than solana
this can be super obnoxious when trying to mint more than 20 or 30 nfts and then transfer them one by one
im not sure how to get the token account ID while minting using candy-machine cli - will need to look further into that. Bc viewing TX hash for each nft is not going to be ideal when doing several thousands nftr mints
hmm right
<@456226577798135808> i looked at the transaction hash on the solana viewer
But how do you get that token ID or whatever it is tho
maybe <#842479735975968818>
so if I wanted to send this token to another wallet, 

It would be like:

`spl-token transfer EzsD67LbdvHVZXVVUcs7HXXzjaBMq83rAE4Pi75WiMw6 1 <DESINTATION ADDRESS>`
Because unlike with sol, I can't just type "transfer 1" and job done. Guess there must be a way to specify what NFT you're trying to move but I don't see how
Hi, is it possible to retrieve OHLC (open, high, low and close) data using web3.js? please let me know.. TIA
oh okay so after I create the token account, how do I actually move my NFTs into there? And how do I move them after from that token account to Phantom or whatever?
is the "token account address" in this case the `EzsD67LbdvHVZXVVUcs7HXXzjaBMq83rAE4Pi75WiMw6`
<@788215642070581289> so say i minted an nft on devnet (https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3big48MFGdMQgTTqfW6G1cs4UJJFTpsUrgAeFL9Vj2xsKAo8zxrDXh8Nk89dxUJ7pSQhHFYN2vMGBov5P5wbkcLz?cluster=devnet)
you can use spl-token transfer.
the concept is that: in solana, SOL address and token address are different.
so if you want to transfer your token (NFT or FT) to some wallet. 
you will need to transfer it into the wallet's token account.
`spl-token create-account --help` will help you to create token account
<@!711352300467257369> hey man i saw you asking in the channel about figuring out how to send minted NFTs to another destination wallet, did you ever figure out how to do that?
I correctly created a candy machine on devnet and was able to mint some on phantom as well as using the mint_one_token but yeah i'm stuck now trying to find out how to move those from there to phantom
I'm seeing this is done using the spl-token transfer command but I don't completely understand it as it's asking me some kind of token address which I don't get what is it
was going to ask the same question - if I have a token that I minted but want to transfer that specific token to another wallet on the devnet, struggling to see the right command to do so. I see in the docs `solana transfer [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT>` - it doesn't seem like theres an option to specify what token is being transferred
How do I transfer an NFT on cli?
If you're interested in a more hacky approach, I'm still in progress but have a command line based node hybrid that's cheap and dirty but works a charm here: https://github.com/h4rkl/Ghetto-SolAir
not sure I understand your qn but I give some points to you.

PDA should be off-curve (ed25519) and PDA is (seeds + prgoram id)
your seed may not be used if your result on-curve.
if you don't mind seeds will be changed, you just change the seeds to derived again until it success (by `CreateProgramAddress`)
or if your seeds is meaningful, you want to reserve it,  you use `find_program_address`
find_program_address's main idea is put a bump_seed (1 byte) in the end and decrease the byte from 255 to 0. it will return the first success result (off-curve pubkey and seed)
or each program generates different seeds or somethings?
anyone can generate bump_seed from this isn't it ?
let (pda, bump_seed) = Pubkey::find_program_address(&[b"escrow"], program_id);
Hey guys can anyone confirm something for me? Did the other marketplaces like Solanart, Magic Eden, etc use Metaplex as their base infrastructure for listing, buying/selling?
Did u find a fix? Im getting similar error
If you run your own cluster with different genesis config, is it tied to the SOL token, or does it work like a side-chain where you can have your own token and network?
You're welcome to try updating and making a PR. Likely going to need to pass the information into the thrown error
This error is likely because you're passing the wrong key
u think i can edit it
ah damnnnn
It logs itself instead of throwing inside the error. May be a good issue to add to the repo
It looks like you may not be able to https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/web3.js/src/connection.ts#L3569

  <STAKE_ACCOUNT_PUBKEY> <VOTE_ACCOUNT_PUBKEY>
im handling it in a try...catch and it still appears
im more trying to figure out how to stop that message from being thrown in the console
What request are you running?
i understand the error
That error means you have no SOL for transactions. If you're local, testnet, or devnet, just airdrop some for yourself
Any suggestion for that ? Error: RPC request error: Account data could not be deserialized to vote state
but it still console logs the error in the terminal which i am trying to stop
logs is empty

even though I try...catch it

is this normal?
hey guys so im using the solana module for js and when i run a certain function, when theres an error it keeps logging the error, even if i handle it
Trying to get tokens owned:

Encoded binary (base 58) data should be less than 128 bytes, please use Base64 encoding.
hey, I've heard that in solana NFTs can be modifiable, but I can't find any info about it in the docs, can someone point me there?
Would I create the string client side, serialize it, pass the serialized form to instruction_data and then deserialize instruction_data in program?
how? I only saw accounts and instruction_data as params to the on-chain entry point? I.e. how would I pass a single string param to an on-chain program?
for example, interacting with a lending protocol of my choice. Trying to find the parallels to ethereum here.
heyo guys, was wondering what the best way to call contracts from a wallet using @solana/web3.js is?
You can pass arguments into program calls
Makes sense.
Thanks.
I'm assuming that's how arguments are passed to on-chain programs usually? A few successive accounts with some data in them?
Also sorry very novice question, how can I create an account client-side and write some custom data to it's `data` field client side?
Each field has its size defined. If it‚Äôs not filled fully, the rest will be empty (=null) until the next field
I would expect them to be at the end.
But why put them in the middle then?
Ah.
But accounts have a fixed size space that you can‚Äôt change later on
Looks like the metadata didn‚Äôt use up all the space available
Are the null bytes some sort of padding?
You need to do that in the schema you give Borsh.
https://gist.github.com/dvcrn/c099c9b5a095ffe4ddb6481c22cde5f4#file-metadata-ts-L70-L188
Yeah the public as string defines pubkey as 32 bytes, which is the space needed to store a pubkey
but then in the on-chain struct the variable can have type Pubkey
Ohh that makes sense, so in my Javascript class I need to define the PublicKey variable to be of type StringPublicKey

Then while on the topic, can you please explain the seemingly unneeded null bytes here:
Hmm.
Borsh cares a lot about byte sizes for the schema
Correct
It is a special datatype that is deserialized into a string, but serialized as raw bytes.
Not really.
Ok cool, pubkeyAsString is just aliased from string type I think
```js
// Borsh extension for pubkey stuff
(BinaryReader.prototype as any).readPubkey = function () {
  const reader = this as unknown as BinaryReader;
  const array = reader.readFixedArray(32);
  return new PublicKey(array);
};

(BinaryWriter.prototype as any).writePubkey = function (value: PublicKey) {
  const writer = this as unknown as BinaryWriter;
  writer.writeFixedArray(value.toBuffer());
};

(BinaryReader.prototype as any).readPubkeyAsString = function () {
  const reader = this as unknown as BinaryReader;
  const array = reader.readFixedArray(32);
  return base58.encode(array) as StringPublicKey;
};

(BinaryWriter.prototype as any).writePubkeyAsString = function (
  value: StringPublicKey
) {
  const writer = this as unknown as BinaryWriter;
  writer.writeFixedArray(base58.decode(value));
};
```
Here, `address` is using a custom datatype of `pubkeyAsString`, so it should not interfere with anything else.
And the schema must specify the datatype.
So Borsh needs a schema to encode/decode data.
Sorry, what does that show?
Note how `address` has a custom type of `pubkeyAsString`
```js
{
      kind: "struct",
      fields: [
        ["address", "pubkeyAsString"],
        ["verified", "u8"],
        ["share", "u8"],
      ],
    },
```
Hmmm okay, I think that's what we were running into
I don't think it should.
Right, but will that interfere with serializing the other types?
You can try:
https://gist.github.com/dvcrn/c099c9b5a095ffe4ddb6481c22cde5f4#file-metadata-ts-L18-L40
credits: <@!137101040687382528>
But then I think it messes up serializing the other types
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/81023eb3e52c31b605e1dcf2eb1e7425153600cd/js/packages/common/src/utils/borsh.ts
In order to support PublicKey, for example, I think metaplex wrote a custom extension to help it deal w PublicKeys
Yep! Using it right now, but it has trouble with PublicKey
https://www.npmjs.com/package/borsh
Well you can use the Borsh npm package.
Want to model a class which holds a key to some SPL token's mint, as well as some data
Why would you want to do that?
Oh sorry basically a javascript class with a PublicKey member and a string member
Which struct?
What does the PubKey have to do with the struct?
Does anyone know how to serialize/deserialize a struct client-side with a PubKey and a string?
I think the address has changed, can you do a find-and-replace to change it to `api.devnet.solana.com` ?
oh - i thought the documentation says that it will be deprecated at 2.0
in your case `getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2` is deprecated and is only gonna work on a node that isn't on version 17
WebSocket connection to 'wss://devnet.solana.com/' failed:
the specific method calls that are dependant on the RPC would be something like `getVersion` where it asks the client for some info specific to the node
Are there any errors logged to the console?
I've got a list of owners
I can't get to that stage
If yes then you can use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountsbyowner
oh - is there any material on why this would be different for different rpcs - i was doing getconfirmedsignaturesforaddress2
Is the CSV working?

Keep in touch, if either of us get it working would be a good resource üôÇ
Not yet. But in about 10 hours, yes
<@!472178514846679041> You've got experience with this?

Do you have the script for this? Also trying to figure this out üôÇ
i don't think this is expected behaviour? but wondering if anyone else has experienced this
im finding that the same rpc call to two separate providers (mainnet beta vs a private rpc endpoint) are providing different results
Ah.

who is gonna be in lisbon?
If one was to start their own cluster with different genesis config, is it tied to the SOL token, or does it work like a side-chain where you can have your own token and network?
a bit more then the CLI calculates
yeah in reality it cost me 3 sol
we don't really have a good solution, but one way we were thinking was to create an account for each nft and use a pda to point to it, but it would be thousands of accounts
anyone have any suggestions on how you would take nft attributes that are on arweave and put them on Solana? nft was created using metaplex, but we want Solana program to be able to interact with it. An example would be proving ownership of attributes - the program would expose functions to get a particular attribute, you could pass in the nft id and the program would return the nfts attribute using the respective method
I have a wss node and I feel like this should be possible but I can't find any documentation on this
is it possible to listen for transactions or events on a specific contract/program?
Which is apparently not enough
however when I try to deploy it says `funds for spend (1.56235992 SOL) + fee (0.00492 SOL)`
Funded it with 5 sol and what remained was 1.8 sol
I made a new wallet funded it wit the same amount on testnet and tried to deploy there
where you deploying the debug output of your program to testnet?
However cli says I need 1.5 sol, while to deploy on testnet I needed 3.5 sol
Actually apparently I don't
I've more SOL than CLI specifies
The CLI wouldn't start without me having enough sol right?
Do you have enough SOL to cover the deployment?
How can I debug this?
Can anyone help?
Hey, I'm trying to deploy a smart contract on main net and getting this response `Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x1`
hello guys a question please , how can I convert my pubKey to Json encoded using javascript ?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

And on which instruction?
Ok, presuming that, what error are you getting back?
dont matter
like i said, you can use a random uuid
Again, why would you think a Python UUID4 is equivalent to a Solana address or ID?
bump: https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/900055798376452136
Metaplex works like that and by inertion most of solana nft collections.. Metaplex has their own ar wallet, they actually subsidize the storage. Arweaves strategy is that the ar bundlers are going to accept payments in any currency and do the conversion themselfs so you are going to pay them in sol. There is no 'native' api for swapping sol to ar. You could have a cex bot or something but then it is not per transaction ,there is to much time delay.
Is anyone using Solana for tokens but then saving user data onto Arweave. How are you handling the conversions from SOL to AR to pay for the Arweave transaction? Is there an api to convert directly from SOL to AR and then a bridge to trigger the AR transaction? Help appreciated!
Why might I be getting a connection error when I do `solana transfer <adds> 1 --url http://X.X.X.X:8899` with an RPC node I've setup in the cloud?

The IP is accessible (ping works)
The port is open (nc can reach it)
The exact same command, except with `--url localhost:8899` works locally on the node just ok.

What might I be missing?

The error: 
```
Error: RPC request error: cluster version query failed: error sending request for url (http://X.X.X.X:8899/): connection error: Connection reset by peer (os error 54)
```
Same as not every waking hour do you get paid for üòâ
Yep.  Just remember that not every slot produces a block.
<@!585868308419444749> I just verified and by calling older slot I got `88449727, 88449732` so indeed. I meet this multiple times I guess I'm just not use to it yet. Thanks
The intermediate slots may have simply not produced blocks
Hello üëã

I got a question regarding the `getBlocks` rpc call,
It appears that if your `start_slot` pass as argument is "old" (~3min), result from the node appears inconsistent.
By inconsistent I mean the first result of the call is not starting from what you give in params (`start_slot`), which means you cannot know if there is any valid slot between what you ask for and the first slot result from the array's slot reponse.

```

As the call can return up to 500k slot, I don't really understand this behavior. Any idea ?
Yeah really frustrating :((
Nothing i
is there a recommended max size an account should not exceed? In this example the account size is setup to be 1024 bytes which is 32 pubkeys in length. 

If I'm storing the edges in accounts instead, i.e. account with seeds ["edge", Token_1_address, Token_2_address]. Is there an easy way to query all edges that's connected to say Token_1?
Probably look at what one of the SDKs does to create it.  Or just use one of them and don't work about it
Thank you very much for your response! I already tried decoding it as a base64, with not much success. What I‚Äôm trying to do is to be able to generate my own param in order to then send transaction. Any idea how I can do that? Many thanks in advance for your help!
this is also in the logs fwiw `consumed 41415 of 200000 compute units`
hey I'm trying to do something like this and my program is failing with `failed: custom program error: 0xa4'`
```Rust
pub fn create(ctx: Context<Create>) -> ProgramResult {
        msg!("initalizing account");
        let base_names = vec!["Grass", "Stalk", "Lily", "Root", "Lotus", "Vine", "Plant", "Bloom"];
        msg!("{:?}", base_names);

        let flora_account = &mut ctx.accounts.flora_account;

        for name in base_names.into_iter() {
            flora_account.base_names.push(String::from(name));
        }
        msg!("{:?}", flora_account.base_names);
        msg!("done");
        Ok(())
    }
...
#[account]
pub struct FloraAccount {
    pub base_names: Vec<String>,
}
```

If I reduce the base_names `Vec` down to one element, the program runs fine and returns the vector to the client. However, running with 8 elements as is, results in the aforementioned error. This is probably due to some size limitation enforced by the Solana runtime? Is there anyway to know this and is it possible to accomplish what I'm doing?
It's a base64-encoded, bincode-serialized transaction
```

no. but they were awesome enough to basically give you a potential start to a storefront along with a lot of tools. behind the scenes in Metaplex is 'candy üç¨ ' machine. Metaplex is the Solana NFT standard.

how are you trying to add an SPL Token? and what is the error
Hey guys can anyone help me with this little question, does anyone has experience using a solana wallet outside of a web browser? what I need is to sign tx in a windows app, I dont find any solution, im using electron js, but its hard to make phantom extension work in an electron app, has any one tried before ? what would be the best soluition in this case ?
I would like to add an SPL token to my devnet wallet, but it gives an error. Can someone help me with this?
Being that specific would just encourage cute interpretations.  Best I'd be willing to do is add, "don't be an asshole"
I want to create an NFT game that's either web based, or made in Unreal Engine 5. The game development isn't my problem but learning how to connect NFTs is, what is a good / easy way to get this done? I want users to be able to upload their NFTs into the game. I just applied to **Stardust** but what wondering what else may be good to look into?
And it doesn't help that almost every articles uses those endpoints as examples.
If you don't want people using it for launch, the _least_ you can do is say so.
Unsuitable != unusable.
It's fairly public knowledge that the rate limits make it unsuitable for such a thing
I see, thanks for the clarification
To be fair, the page with the endpoints doesn't say "Don't launch NFTs with this".
People wouldn't stop launching NFTs on the public RPC infra, so now everyone gets to suffer an origin ban
I would like to add an SPL token to my devnet wallet, but it gives an error. Can someone help me with this?
hmm network tab shows status code of 200, but getting these errors on console:

If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

any idea what went wrong?
and tbc, I'm using `msg!` to log output in my program
sorry I know this is probably really vague
I'm trying to test my program and the Program log returns:
```

but `solana logs --url localhost` isn't returning anything. Any ideas?
Can you check the network tab?
You should not be getting CORS issues.
Hmm.
trying to do this using localhost and am getting CORS errors, any way to bypass this in dev?
Pass the program ID
this repo is very useful, thank you very much
the program id one can help you to fetch all spl token account owned by your sol address
you pass token program as argument like https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/advanced/token/get-all-token-account-by-owner/main.en.ts
getTokenAccountsByOwner seems to request a mint address / programID
but how would i get "all spl tokens of a address"?

hi all. don't have permission to post in the developer support channel, just decided to build something on solana and I'm currently working through the rust docs, as advised by this tutorial: https://jamesbachini.com/solana-tutorial/

Just wondering if there is any reason not to use that tutorial? Or if it should still be good and current?
Ty
update: my friend pointed out to me that the block may be incomplete if using `processed` commitment. So that's probably why
how come if I fetch a recent blockhash using commitment `processed` it can be unreliable even on localnet? Like if I use that recent blockhash for some test transactions, I can get `BlockhashNotFound` errors.

I'd have thought everything I do on localnet would work with just `processed` commitment
Hi, I've tried that and used 
(tar jxf solana-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
cd solana-release/
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH). I get a validator process aborted error when doing solana-test-validator (with config set to localhost) though.
if I wanted to parse transactions data from a local validator node and store it in some form of a local RDBMS, how would I do that?
1. Get the validator node up and running
2. ???
3. Use Kafka to stream into a db / data warehouse / data lake

I've looked through the files inside of `/ledger` generated by the node, but stuff there looks cryptic. Can someone smarter than me suggests high level steps?
can an account have a property that is an array or vector of strings?
```Rust
#[account]
pub struct NamesAccount {
    pub base_names: Vec<str>,
}
```
This produces the following error:
```
the trait bound `str: std::clone::Clone` is not satisfied

expected an implementor of trait `std::clone::Clone`
```
The goal is to have an account that holds an immutable fixed length array of strings representing name - not really sure how to approach something like this. my hunch is that it would have to be like a byte array and I need to parse through that?
this was *just* recommended to me completely forgot - thanks!

Hello, looking to get started with the basics. I am trying to get the hello-world example working on a Linux VM (Ubuntu 20.04 and 18.04) but have run into an issue when building from source (linking with cc failed).

I have also tried by installing the tool suite only and running the test validator by I get "Validator process aborted". 

Any suggestions?

I know you just want to use this rpc api but if you want to use it you need to know how to encode tx.‚Ä®
seems you don‚Äôt want to use other sdks to do it, so I post the tx‚Äôs article for you.
You need to pack your tx by you own then pass it into the rpc.

<@!788215642070581289> im a java dev and dont really know any rust . thats why i was looking at the rpc examples
thanks Chido
https://discord.gg/SYVUFCEG
give you some points.
a tx = some signatures + one message
a message = all instructions's accounts + instructions
a instruction = accounts + data
when you call `sendTransaction` you will encode the byte array to string (base58 or base64)

not sure where you want to use this message. but the main idea is to put your message into instruction's data

here is memo program if you need
https://spl.solana.com/memo
its an example from here

hi thank you for the reply can i give you an example <@!788215642070581289>
sure. basically all data you passed  in a tx is just a uint8 array. how to decode it depends on you.
or you can use memo program for some note purposes.
oh seems your token account haven't init. you can try.
`spl-token transfer --fund-recipient <from-token-address> 1 <phantom-wallet-address>`
but in tx, you will create a token account for the phantom wallet address. (rent will be charged from you)
Thanks for this, I was wondering more like, can I get to see some examples too?
hi guys im new here . and new to this coin im wondering is it possible to send messages in the tranc payload
Yes but spl token cli provides a flag to send to an account that may not have a token account in its associated token account
I remember that phantom wallet don't show token account address. it only show SOL address.
so you will need to transfer to a token account which owned by the address.
Account could not be parsed as token account: pubkey=BcVfACAMfEBUE9VLKpgcrJSssTVyeUE8UmH26oU2YZBg
why am i getting this error when i try to transfer a token to my phantom wallet?? token account does have supply does it have to do with the receiver account??
of course. you can take a look at how token swap program transfer their token
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token-swap/program/src/processor.rs#L138-L149
are there security concerns of using `signTransaction` (wallet will sign and return) vs `sendTransaction` (wallet will sign and send) ?
yes. account in solana like file in linux. we store data into account.
<@788215642070581289> Thanks alot ,

Also I see that counter value is coming from a AccountInfo struct here .Does that mean counter is stored in a account ( Like owner of smart contract has some data value associated with it )?
Hey everyone, I want to create my own custom spl-tokens using Rust programs... Is there any example that I can refer to?

Hey guys,
I want to create a simple smart contract with counter which should be incremented everytime the contract is called .

 Normally with solidity we declare a state variable & keep on incrementing it .How do I achieve same here ?
on account creation you can set a max size based on some estimate and work within that. this may be an option for you to store data: https://github.com/hashblock/solana-cli-program-template/blob/main/program/src/account_state.rs#L16. most data fits into a handful of data models. you need to figure out what those are. then which of those you really need to store. and then how to do them in rust, and pass them back and forth, as required.

Hi All, I have a question regarding dynamic size lengthed data in SOL accounts. Would appreciate some pointers!

Context: I'm build a project where NFTs can connect to each other. One NFT can point to variable amount of NFTs. I want to store that relation in a progrma on-chain.

AFAIK Sol accounts have a pre-declared fixed size, but I want to potentially store variable amount of data. One thing I can do is just to store the edges derived from seeds as `["edge", <node_1>, <node_2>]` but that would make accessing the data difficult. Since most interactions i would expect to be querying which nodes is a certain node connected to. Any thoughts on how I would implement this?
May I know what does mint authority and update authority refers to in the nft explore page? Thanks
when we call the invoke signed function whose seeds are supposed to be passed there? and sorry for asking a naive question what exactly is a seed??
Unfortunately not, beyond walking `getBlock`

hey guys, I am working on a demo of cross program invocation, but from the `send_call` here, I can't pass the `accounts_infos` to the receiver(the argument `account_infos` is `[]` in the receiver's instruction) while the `porgram_id` and `data` can be passed, is there any solution üò¢
I'm running into a very odd issue. Seems that an ix is failing during one half of the day, then working when trying again in a few hours. Here's an example of this https://explorer.solana.com/address/3Hv7Np3sVBcKQuDp5YiGp1u3p1sQeyGUSUstJiMETniB

I just tried the ix again, with no changes to the program, and it's failing again. Could this be because of different validator having a different version so it works sometimes but not others? It seems pretty unlikely, but I'm failing to find another reason for this behavior
The `rewards` object in the `getBlock` [1] JSON RPC method will show rent payments by accounts as they are collected by the runtime
[1] https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getblock
It's somewhat confusing because rent payments occur at the block level, so you don't always see them when looking at a specific transaction.
Your account is paying rent because it's balance is less than the rent-exempt minimum
```
$ solana rent 0
Rent per byte-year: 0.00000348 SOL
Rent per epoch: 0.000002439 SOL
Rent-exempt minimum: 0.00089088 SOL
```

Amazing,
Thank you so much üôèüèº
many differences. but yes you can use web3, among other clients SDKs to interact with programs (smart contracts). 
no EVM compatibility, per say. several parties are working on ports, compilation, or some form of evm compatibility or migration.  
one of the biggest differences is solana programs are stateless. most eth contracts are full of state. this means you pass everything you need to act on, into the program. data to save/store/manipulate, keys, instructions, accounts, etc.
here are some ethereum/solidity to solana links that may help clear some of the diffs up:
https://solana.wiki/docs/solidity-guide/introduction/
https://www.notion.so/Solana-Rust-Intro-for-Solidity-Devs-e27d881a14794a3199514336ee032d0c#eb143eaecb5c4ff4a5d7129826df83c8
otherwise the docs, <#763249718339567626> , and https://solana.com/developers are good places to start.

Hey all, may I ask is there any method we could query all nft token addresses from one collection?
Hi,
Coming from BSC and ETH blockchain I was wondering if the mechanism to interact with smart contracts is the same on solana ?
Seems like we need to use web3.js instead of ethers but any other difference ?
I want to listen to events and interact (=send transactions) through the sc
Thanks üññüèº
its a curl error?  failure to write to output destination.. you might not have permission to write to the destination. tmp or dir may be full. among other things.  could also run curl with -v  --verbose to maybe get more detail
for the key and the seed you can send from the client and based on your use case it may be best, but it is possible to have a seed or other logic present in the program itself. generally if a client needs to refer to something by a seed and or key you may want to do the same by passing it to the program for it to use in a similar manner.
also we need to send pda publickkey from frontend and match from findprogramaddress in our solana program ?
so in most of the cases we need to send seed from front end for pda ?
please why do i get this error when trying to install solana release
correct
hmmm.. assuming then you have to be running a validator to use this plugin and export account state?
I think so
if I wanted to export data from a bunch of program-owned accounts to postgres, could I use this plugin to do that?
You can't use that from a smart contract unfortunately
Hey all, curious if anyone has any examples of using this `AccountsDbPlugin` in a smart contract? 
https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1446532770994348034?s=20
that worked, thank you so much man. Can't believe I missed that
holy shit did I just miss this the whole time?!?!?!?!!?
you use the parsed version as well?
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner
at least one way, is to download the source. follow the readme. and you can run from each respective project folder. for local build.
otherwise you can try to install like other packages with NPM, if you know what you want to use.
Is there a way to force clear the image cache Solana saves for an NFT's metadata? (so it force updates everywhere)
I saw this which would work great, except I also need to call methods like `getTokenAccountsByOwner` which has the hardcoded base64 encoding üò¶ but thank you!
have you tried?
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getParsedAccountInfo
did you ever figure this out? running into the same problem ^
usually the metaplex discord is a better source for NFT and Candy machine questions and info, but here are some resources you might find helpful for both as well:
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/886259112105635940/886269376196657172
This might be a stupid question, but I don't see a way to specify a json response from the RPC API using the solana web3js package . 

Currently I'm initializing a connection, and then calling a method like `connection.getAccountInfo(...)` and the response back is encoded in base64, which is fine but then how do I decode this into readable info?

I get back a Buffer, which I then decode into base64, but then get back a string that doesn't look like interpretable b64.

At the end of it all I get back something that looks like:
```
GK8RLPuDu/9yG3l0nvOTMPy+/lBo38wHeZQx6LS0cX51pVgaKI8kOcX3Y0rzTLoghR4dz0RUGCESiqPNiBpuIwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 
```

Is this an instruction that I then need to decode further with something like web3's `SystemInstruction.decode....`? Any help is appreciated!
sure, tomorrow, it is way too late here already
if you have not yet, please file an issue in the solana github for this issue for tracking. in the mean time will look into it. 
if you happen to come across a resolution or working data please follow up

i was using the wrong address, i used the token address rather than the token account address in my `spl-token transfer` command
i think i might have figured it outa ctually
well im creating the tokens via the candy-machine CLI and so i was trying to work out how to use the solana CLI to do the sending etc
afaik you just send the token to the target address from your end-user wallet and don't have to worry about token accounts
also apologies if im asking the wrong question per-se, i'm new to the solana ecosystem and am trying to learn
as a follow up, does anyone know if phantom wallet's already have solana token accounts set up by default? struggling to find information on my questions through my own research
say i have a NFT that i minted, and can see the token account and token id here https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3big48MFGdMQgTTqfW6G1cs4UJJFTpsUrgAeFL9Vj2xsKAo8zxrDXh8Nk89dxUJ7pSQhHFYN2vMGBov5P5wbkcLz?cluster=devnet

I know that in order to transfer the token to another location, I need to send it to another token account. I was wondering if I wanted to send it to a Phantom wallet - how can I create a token account for a specific phantom wallet, or how can i find the token account address for a particular phantom wallet? If I know the phantom wallet's public key
thanks for reporting this
pubkey is base58‚Äìencoded pubkey of a _vote_ account
accInfo is the result of this call:
<https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getaccountinfo> 
Also, it is really a very simple call straight out of documentation:
<https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-reference#voteaccount>
As for versions, i tried the last 2: 1.29.1 and 1.29.2
(if cost is a concern, use IPFS üòÑ doesn't cost anything, just need to get file pinning sorted)
‚ù§Ô∏è
have a great day
peace on you
hm okok thanks
yeah should be the same for solana stuff. No idea about arweave
devnet and maineet its same fee to mint ?
before release on mainnet ?
i will have the possibility to see how much it cost to mint ?
on dev net i can try what i want
im a beginner, i have a last question
I'm a IPFS guy :p
ok no problem
ah you're asking about arweave - sorry don't know that. Never used arweave
<@!137101040687382528> someone said arweave stock image, so if you put image it will cost more to mint an nft
what ends up being passed as pubkey? 
and what is accInfo, and accInfo.data? 
an error like that may indicate that the data set was outside the range which might mean something is off about the request or data. 
have you done anymore debugging and have a reproduceable example?
+ what versions are you using?
correct, if you use metadata program to create metadata for your NFT, it needs to allocate the entire space onchain which costs rent in SOL
The space is fixed and doesn't change if you use the image field or don't. If you don't set an image, it will just be filled with 0 bytes

wait actually image URI isn't even stored onchain, it's only the metadata json which points to the image, so yeah it doesn't matter
If there is an image or not, it dont change the cost of mint ?
if you use other stuff like editions and what not, it could be more, haven't used those myself
if you pay for those yourself, and use metaplex metadata program directly to submit metadata
very very rough guess for mint + metadata space for ~2000 tokens, I reckon somewhere in between 2-4 SOL maybe?
minimum
how much it will cost ?
but a normal user could mint like 2500NFT
I want to 1M NFT, each user can mint one NFT
it needs to allocate the metadata space for you anyway, which is fixed in size
really?
if you add metadata to metaplex, no matter if you use an image or not, it will have the same cost
I want a token with supply 1MILLION
just make a token with supply 1 and disable future minting, that's your NFT
Hi, is it possible to create NFT without image, the goal is to not pay fees for mint (or reduce them considerably)

You can actually see their network calls to coingecko's api to get the price of each coin in the network tab
not sure if they're an amm tho
https://github.com/Synthetify/synthetify-webapp you can look at the git for synthetify here, they seem to be using pyth oracles to compute their tvl
They will def respond
(Via Twitter tagging)
Honestly you are better off asking them directly if you don‚Äôt get the answer here.
When protocols like Saber show USD value of their TVL, how do they ensure the conversions are accurate? Do they utilize oracles to derive the numbers (though I imagine these don't support all tokens)? Do they simply use the current swap rates relative to USDC?

If you need to use "market cap" data straight from the program, is the proper way to only use oracles? Are there exceptions?

you'll want to use the jsonparsed option for the request unless you enjoy parsing things on your own
to know what exactly is returned from this method
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
for reference
I've been playing around with a bit like this: 
```
let signature = MARKET_INIT_TX
    console.log("signature ", signature)
    let tx = await connection.getTransaction(signature);
    console.log(tx.meta);
    try {
        console.log(tx.meta.innerInstructions[0].instructions);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error, signature);
    }

```
look here: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/explorer/src/providers
it's what the explorer uses to retrieve it.
if you look at the js API, there's a way to receive the transaction metadata from a signature
the explorer?

oh gosh I missed the space. thanks. So the address is the address that the contract gets deployed to I assume. Thankss
`--bpf-program <ADDRESS BPF_PROGRAM.SO>...` address && bpf_program.so; needs 2

how to get transaction instruction inputs?
Has anyone gone through the PaulX tutorial lately? I'm trying to understand the context of his command? 
`"setup-validator": "solana-test-validator -r --mint E2F3fsS1HpsLb2VpEgsA5ztfo83CWFWW4jWpC6FvJ6qR --bpf-program 4yBTZXsuz7c1X3PJF4PPCJr8G6HnNAgRvzAWVoFZMncH"`

If I run the command without passing the .so file I get `The argument '--bpf-program <ADDRESS BPF_PROGRAM.SO>...' requires 2 values, but 1 was provided`

but this doesn't show a second parameter. 
```--bpf-program <ADDRESS BPF_PROGRAM.SO>...
            Add a BPF program to the genesis configuration. If the ledger already exists then this parameter is silently ignored

you can make your token, and mint them all at once to a controlling wallet and then remove mint authority so no more can be minted then you can do whatever you want with the supply

What's this error please ? <:Crying:877133055729475644>

look at the IDL 'coder' generation.  Anchor is doing this to a larger degree.  There is not yet a native version of this that I know of. I would check more details in the anchor discord.
there is not yet a full blown idea that I know of for development, like remix, but def a great opportunity there for someone to build out and add to.

the biggest library of contracts is simply in github, in the solana and eco system source code. the smart contracts are called programs, so are referred to as such.
so for example in the github here: these are the solana programs library (SPL)
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library
SPL docs are located here:
https://spl.solana.com/
and here is the token program, for example:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token
in addition there is the implementation of native programs:
https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs
is TypeScript client generation from ABIs a thing yet in Solana? Was reading through some anchor examples and couldn't see any examples of generated client code
i have no doubt the pattern in at least some way is achievable. Metaplex is the NFT standard, so trying to incorporate for now utilizing this standard would be ideal. If nothing else you should be able to add some kind of additional meta data. Checkout how editions are done. It may be something you can utilize. If not collections and or having your own parent/child system that utilizes metaplex
particularly im curious whether cpi calls actually depend on passing account data as-is or whether ultimately a fresh execution environment is stood up and all thats really used is addresses signatures and flags
does anyone know where i can find the `sol_invoke_signed_rust` c function implementation? grepping the solana repo doesnt turn it up anywhere
Solana program library is available on github for SC framework you can check it out. I don't think they have any web ide yet. Their local blockchain as far as i know is available in the solana tool suite you can set the network to localhost devnet testnet or mainnet and your contract will be uploaded to that network
Also solana docs are available for providing a better understanding og solana blockchain

https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library

https://docs.solana.com/
I'm trying to figure out the formatting for the config.yml in the solana cli in the solana-keygen grind subcommand:

 ```   -C, --config <FILEPATH>
            Configuration file to use [default: C:\Users\x\.config\solana\cli\config.yml] ```

Anyone know where docs are listed for this specifically?
Hey guys, I'm trying to get a sense of the tools available to developers on the Solana blockchain.  Is there a web IDE for smart contract development?  or a library of smart contracts to dev from?
Also who owns the token and token accounts when we invoke the token program using our custom program? Our program or the token program? Plus can the signing authority of a program change the data in the program accounts?? i.e. A token account that  has mint authority set to someone else?
thanks <@!785084693023424542> , will check out metaplex.
An actual parent-child system would be ideal.
I have a general question about solana programs. What happens to all the tokens and tokens account and other accounts used to store data when we close a program using solana program close? Do they get erased?
are you referring to an actual composable parent-child system? Metaplex has the concept of editions, with things like Master, and Limited editions, and collections.  you can find out more in the metaplex discord.
you should be able to get rough ideas from local and dev deploys.
what are you trying to do? and how are you trying to make the call? 
an error like that tends to mean what you are trying to request is too big, so it is excluded, in this case potentially the entire token program
they keep it updated in the install docs: 
https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/installation.html#install-solana
hi guys, what's the best version of solana to work with anchor ?

Does anyone have any documentation to point to or advice to help me understand this issue?
just reinstall the version you want with the same bash command, just change the version number
There are books on the subject, I'm afraid I can't recall them offhand. I think you'll find human capital harder to coordinate, I've been thinking about this more than straight tokenomics lately: https://mirror.xyz/0x6507C1693c70Ebab813BCeBD8Bcd9152Cfffa91b/WDKGKpfLy-9nX_reyecjdGDA8CRsZ9sy3jk-JjliFnc
use test-validator or do it on devnet, theres also a way to calculate rent exemption, which is the primary cost associated with program deployment
can i estimate contract deployment cost somewhere? or any info from people who tried deploying contracts?

Hi. Looking for a reviewer/auditor for a simple Solana contract (not written with Anchor). Thanks!
seeds are seeds. as long as nothing confidential classified or private is there it should be fine to save them wherever you want. but every use case is different.
the pda seed in the program is used by the program to derive from within the program. so in that sense the derivation is secure.

thanks!
No.  Wallets should be generated client side
Hey! Sorry for the noob question. Is It possible to generate address with the JSON RPC API? I couldnt find any command for it in the docs
Except for a subset of sysvars which can be queried at runtime by the program rather than passed in via the instruction
There's no way to manifest an AccountInfo otherwise
Caller must request from runtime
hmm makes sense, but when I use "invoke" to use the instruction I need to pass the account infos, don't have any way to get it?
There's no networking in contracts, 'cause non-determinism
You have to specify the pubkey in the corresponding instruction and let runtime load it for you
hey guys have any method to get AccountInfo (https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getaccountinfo) from an Pubkey, inside in a contract ? I tried using solana-client and fetching the RPC API, but apparently I don't can fetch an api inside an contract
have you tried the metaplex discord. their team is the one that supports that repo
It helped, ty. I added partialSign with that keypair. Why it needs to be signed with newAccountPubkey, when it's already signed by feePayer?
bincode
Does anyknow the serialization schema for the Stake program
The time goes up every time someone ignores the request not to ask on Discord
There are not conditions on the input, just the output.  You have to grind a bump seed to fulfill the output reqs
Well documented. https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#hash-based-generated-program-addresses
I have this code in my smart contract 

pub(crate) fn get_distributor_token_address_with_seed(
    source_account_info: &Pubkey,
    program_id: &Pubkey
) -> (Pubkey, u8) {
    Pubkey::find_program_address(
        &[&source_account_info.to_bytes()],
        program_id,
    )
}

It returns me with X pubkey if i send my program pubkey and sender pubkey


Now i have this code in node js but it returns me Y pubkey instead of X pubkey as my smart contract. What's wrong here ?

  let source_account_info = new PublicKey("public_key_address_is_here") ;
  let program_id = new PublicKey("Program_id_public_key_address_is_here");    let validProgramAddress = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress([source_account_info.toBuffer()], program_id);
Hi! Is it me, or these conditionals looks weird? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/cli/src/program.rs#L2038 here we check that `system_program::id == account.owner`, and later inside we check https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/cli/src/program.rs#L2043 `account.owner != *loader_id`. Aren't we sure that the owner is system program at that point, and not the loader?

Hello, after pull request is merged how long does it usually take for token logo to appear on Solana explorer ?
So what's a condition necessary for the input to guarantee the creation of a pda?
No
Does a pda exists for every single given input?

Whats up guys, i was messing around with trying to make a 1 of 1 and was wondering if anyone had any insight on how to get tokens to show up as `immutable` when viewing on explorer? 

The token that I made has the `isMutable: 1`  property attached to it in the on-chain token metadata still. And trying to find some documentation on it hasn't been successful. LMK if anyone has any insight please! Thanks ‚úä

For example, this thug bird shows up as `immutable` but the token I made shows up as `mutuable`
If I have a PublicKey instance of an existing NFT mint account and want to create a Token instance for that key, what do I pass in the signer field of the Token constructor?

var codedString = Base58.encode(wallet.secretKey);
console.log (codedString);

but now, when i paste private key to phantom, it not same address.

  console.log("public key...", wallet.publicKey);

get another address ((
pda is made by sha256( seed + programId + "ProgramDerivedAddress" )
I don't think you can reverse it.
Is it possible to get seeds from pda, programId, and bump?
Anybody can suggest me the best hardware where to run 'solana-keygen grind'  in order to brute force at the maximum speed possible? Is it a GPU-based or CPU-based process?
you can do base58 encode to your secret key. that is the format of private key which phantom used
What is the encoding mechanism for getProgramAccounts for staking? I am retreiving this data from RPC but am unsure how to decode it. Thanks.

The mint account of the NFT has to be a variable of type Token to be able to call the function.

Does the Token class constructor work for creating the instance for existing mint accounts? If yes, what do we pass in the payer field?
Hi, new here and interested in doing some first contracts on solana. Are there any MUST READ tutorials you can suggest and are there templates for contracts like a simple token?
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js
You can use the Token.createWrappedNativeAccount function
There are js bindings for the token program
Hi everyone,  Can Somebody explain how to create a Wrapped sol token using web3.js
You can just convert your SOL to wrapped sol to interact with the other spl tokens
Or at least a variation of it
https://spl.solana.com/token-swap
Why not just use this
I am new to Solana . I need some input . I want to create a program where I can swap/exchange the native sol coin for a fixed number of SPL tokens. I am not sure if this is possible by using the solana-program-library/token-swap program. I would like to do it via anchor by deploying a rust contract. Any pointers to previous implementations.

Help will be much appreciated
Hello, Im trying to understand how to use secp256k1-program. Is that possible to verify secp256k1 signature from my program code, calling that native program? The signature would be provided in instruction.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs#secp256k1-program
I think I can do it with `--warp-slot` for setting a specific slot, but the time values do not change, actually after calling it `unix_timestamp` stops changing at all
yes, you're right, just got bogged down in too much information for what i need, thanks again
When in doubt just check the json rpc api reference since it‚Äôs all the available client functionality
jk üôÇ
heh
<@!814228493302497301> smart people rock <@!455114989397868556>
wow, great, this looks much more like what i'm seeking, thanks!
i didn't have a chance to test that many transactions with phantom, although i did sign and approve what i need. does it show how much an arbitrary instruction would cost or just transfers, and maybe well-known calls to trusted programs like serum and alike?
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#simulatetransaction
But don‚Äôt see that retuned in the result
the thing is, the user must feel safe when addressing a contract, because by signing they authorize the program to do whatever with their account balance
I thought it may be by using ‚ÄúsimulateTransaction‚Äù
See, smarter person üôÇ
It‚Äôs definitely possible because phantom wallet displays all of this before executing a transaction.
Especially the execution units, I know of nothing that walks the source and calcs that (tool idea!) other than through the ways I describe. We've used this to see where our execution budget offenders are
i understand, it's unlikely feasible, because the transaction would have to be executed to know all expenses, but well, who knows üôÇ
<@!814228493302497301> thanks for solana-test-validator and logs, validator doesn't start for some reason, figuring out why
I won't say no because smarter people than I may say "Oh yes you can!" üôÇ
but this can't be done programmatically right? just curious
If you do `msg!` or `sol_log_compute_units` just keep in mind they are about 100 execution units per invocation
That way you get a result inclusive of A) Account residency costs, B) Per Signature and C) Execution units (`solana logs`) per instruction
While waiting for a answer, you could observer before/after balances using `solana-test-validator` locally or on devnet/testnet
I want to mock my contracts at different times without adding any conditional compilation if possible
Good day! Is there a way to change `unix_timestamp` for a local validator?
for example, the program is deployed and needs to be initialized via some instruction, to create necessary PDAs and stuff. is it possible to get accumulated cost of such transaction?
what about nested calls to SystemProgram to create accounts, token mint, and minting, etc?
This cost should be based on the amount of signatures, so you can use the fee calculator for this.

Notes:
There are more efficient memory copies implemented by solana syscall but at the moment the focus is on getting the behavior you want
I think so, idk how to do it tho
Hi Chris! Were you able to solve this? I'm having the same error
is it possible to get estimated gas price of an instruction call, including CPIs incurred expenses? say, a user might want to know how much some instruction would cost them before real execution?
Getting this on mainnet

```
Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x1
```

What am I doing wrong?  It worked okay on devnet
Thanks <@814228493302497301> , you are very helpful. I'll try it on my own firstüòÑ
is devnet down right now? or am i doing some mistake?
So, it may if you did not allocate up front enough storage for worst case size but:
When you get the mutable reference to the account `data` it is an array of `u8` and NOT a vector. The approach would be to reconstruct the vector we unpacking the data... operate on the vector as part of your logic and then serialize the vector back to the `data` array.  When you serialize the vector (say using Borsh) it will take encode the size and elements of the vector. If you want, I can whip up a PoC mock of that and gist it
Would that be problem when implementing this in program, because of allocation size( I have less exp. With this), isn't it that with every mutation of `vec` the size is going to change and I'll have to face problem with allocation size?
Mutable vec lets you `push` or `append` (adds to end) and `remove(index)` (e.g. 0) to drop the head and shift remaining to the left
Yup
Is this for in your program (i.e. Rust)?
Hi guys, how can I create a mutable array of structs which when adds a new struct subsequently deletes the 0 index struct from the array?
Hi all, is anyone working on Solana in Java? I found: https://github.com/p2p-org/solanaj and https://github.com/skynetcapital/solanaj - not sure how widely they are used. Specifically I am interested in if what people are using for serialisation/deserialisation  (equivalent to Borsh) in Java.
(sorry for repeat post).
Can anyone please recommend a burn address that can be used from Phantom wallet?
To send an NFT that I incorrectly minted via Holaplaex.
Wait why are you doing `Buffer.from(source_account_info.toBuffer())`? (Buffer.from(xxx.toBuffer()) Does that work? You can leave out the `Buffer.from` since `toBuffer()` already gives you a buffer
I'd check that `source_account_info` and `program_id` in your javascript is actually what you expect it to be
code looks ok to me
`  let source_account_info = new PublicKey(sender.PublicKey) ;`

sender.PublicKey isn't type PublicKey already? 
What about program_id? You're doing `program_id = new PublicKey(program_id.PublicKey)`
I have this code in my smart contract 

pub(crate) fn get_distributor_token_address_with_seed(
    source_account_info: &Pubkey,
    program_id: &Pubkey
) -> (Pubkey, u8) {
    Pubkey::find_program_address(
        &[&source_account_info.to_bytes()],
        program_id,
    )
}

It returns me with X pubkey if i send my program pubkey and sender pubkey


Now i have this code in node js but it returns me Y pubkey instead of X pubkey as my smart contract. What's wrong here ?

  let source_account_info = new PublicKey(sender.PublicKey) ;
  let program_id = new PublicKey(program_id.PublicKey);
 let validProgramAddress = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress([Buffer.from(source_account_info.toBuffer())], program_id);
aww got it thanks
yes. it is the error I'm taking about. check https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/PublicKey.html#findProgramAddress for the solution!
sometime
but it gives us Error: Invalid seeds, address must fall off the curve
let highEntropyBuffer = crypto.randomBytes(31);
let programAddressFromKey = await web3.PublicKey.createProgramAddress([highEntropyBuffer.slice(0, 31)], base58publicKey);
console.log(`Generated Program Address: ${programAddressFromKey.toBase58()}`);


i tried this as well
thanks <@!788215642070581289>
the concept is workable. when you do this, you treat sender.PublicKey as seed.
but if you use createProgramAddress, it probably failed because the result on-curve.
you can check `findProgramAddress` for the solution if you want to remain your sender pubkey as seed and ensure it must success
you mean code of a program? not doable, you'd need to run it through some decompiler/disassembler
is there a way to check latest deployed smart contrats?
Hi, is there any way to get on which blocks smart contract was deployed? Explorer shows only last deployment slot. Thanks
Hence why retry is important?
I am guessing if the block gets written but doesn't include the tx then it's lost?
Tx gets forwarded to the leader
also one last question chase: easiest way to look at code for a specific contract?
I read that Solana doesn't have a memepool
hello everyone can i create pda from fronted with two public key instead of seeds


    let pda = PublicKey.createProgramAddress(sender.PublicKey,programId);
thanks
ok. Will ask. I'm in that too
Transactions can get dropped for different reasons, but that shouldn‚Äôt be normal to get 50% of them dropped. Could possibly have something to do with candy machine. Check metaplex discord to see if others have similar issues
tx**
trying to find a failed t
That's a relief!!!!
well if i want to spend say 100 sol on mints, 40-50% of tx's fail. So i'd assume i'd have to send multitudes of tx's
it'll always find the same address given the same mintkey
Oh yes one more thing.....
```const metadataAccount = (
        await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
            [
                Buffer.from('metadata'),
                metadataProgramId.toBuffer(),
                mintKey.toBuffer(),
            ],
            metadataProgramId,
        )
    )[0];```

if i provide it with the mintKey that was used to create this account will the address be a new one or will it be the same as it was created before?
How many are you talking about?
You can send as many txs as you want
but basically can i just send out A LOT of tx's? and not worry if some fail?
You are better off asking these questions in metaplex discord
I will try again with another launch
nah everyone just copy pastes the existing candymachine/lottery contracts
Are they custom contracts?
It‚Äôs plausible that these smart contracts are preventing it somehow.
Okay great... thank you!!
it seems bots get their tx's front run some how
yepp
re: dropped txs, chase obviously knows better here but I remember faintly reading in this chat that Solana can drop transactions and you need to handle some sort of retry logic (?)
this is seems much more feasible the address will be my custom program address right?
thats what I used to dump a list of tokens from my program
I'll find a dropped transaction example.
how about https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2 to get all confirmed transactions for a address, then go 1by1 over them?
What is it?
yip
Ah ok. I mean do you get an error
sorry!
and yet tx's still randomly drop. Should i ask this question elsewhere?
i'm writing code to utilise the sol network to mint stuff. there is no other bottle neck in my code
This doesn‚Äôt sound like a development question.
Okay so pass in the transaction string but the thing is all transactions have already been done and now i want to get the token and token accounts from like some thousands of transaction
and running transactions locally by setting config ID's to relevant candymachine
using a custom rpc
basically i have seen bots minting nft's on launch and when i try mint during same time, my transactions get dropped
cause i need to use a wallet inside a windows app (made with electon js )
Not enough information to answer this but it‚Äôs definitely not network congestion
yeah the thing is that i can not use any of the availables wallets
a lot of the functioanlity already exists in many ways
depends what functionality you want to add and in what language and what final use case is
how difficult is it to code a sol wallet ?
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getConfirmedTransaction

it takes the signature / tx hash
when network gets extremely congested, is there a way to have transactions confirm 100%? and ASAP?
for transaction metadata do i have to check it on the solana explorer or is there some solana web3 function or class to get that done?
hey <@!455114989397868556> any info regarding this?
you should be able to get that information from the transaction metadata I think
üò´
i've been thinking for a whole day but don't find any solution
yeah that could lead to serious security issues
is there a way to get a record of the tokens, and token accounts that are created by cross program invocation? when i cross invoke the token program the tokens that are created who is their owner program, my custom program or the token program?
but you'd need the users private key ü§î
you can use https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/ directly
so i was thinking maybe I can handle tx with the solana CLI
so i can not use phantom
but im using electron
the thing is that i need to use a wallet inside my app
hey thanks for answering me
a javascript app inside a browser? 

solana CLI is just calling certain things onchain, you can easily replicate that in javascript with web3.js
Hey guys I have a question is it possible to make an interface between solana CLI and a javascript app ?
Oh, okay, thanks!!
Got it working with the bs58 rust package. Thanks boss!
I just shared a link to website and all of these sdks have these functionalities
Thanks man! You're awesome
Yes, I want to connect solana to a flutter application. But as there is no direct connection yet, I will be using NodeJs as a middlewear and performing all the solana operations like connect to the wallet, getting balance in the API. So anyone have any idea for Integratng Smart Contract to the Backend API. Found this link for Ethereum. Something like this for Solana ? https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/01/nodejs-api-ethereum-blockchain/
Solana uses a json rpc api. Multiple SDKs built on top of it at Solana.com/developers
Or solana to build Rest APIs?
https://github.com/cryptoplease/cryptoplease-dart
Not that I know of.
Hello guys, is there anyone using solana in flutter?
And the api reference section is right after this
This might be a good start then
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-api
Thanks man I'll try that right now
will do ‚ù§‚ù§üôèüôè
Ahhh okay, I haven't really dived into web3. Thanks guys. I'm working with another developer to grab wallets and see all the tokens/nfts within the wallet lol
Try Solana.com/developers
```
$ xxd -r -pi <<<d3a2297a90418ec41bc79f4d1474873252c3237bea7da4b64aede0926db5b1d3 | bs58
FF8Sb1rFm8mhY9bTmi4GyHBdcd1Que9dCqNSyjFuysxN
```
<@203354189898842112>
You can test that first by using PublicKey.isOnCurve
As long as it‚Äôs on the curve
In web3.js
If you decode it you can use

new PublicKey(‚Äúyour private key string here‚Äù)
Yeah I believe I have enough experience with JS, rust is new to me, im checking for that too
so in this case I'd be decoding it and then converting to bip39?
Depends if you are building your own smart contracts / programs or just dapps
okay I will check thank you very much
Mostly JavaScript and rust
the rust book is probably a good start
hello, to intro to sol programming, what are some skills that you need to ready up before?
https://solana.com/ecosystem
I see
Then you can convert it to a public key
Yes, you need to decode it using something like TextDecoder for js
I would like to know that are there any analytic tools for solana made out there
Is there a way to use the pubkey format returned by phantom wallet for the json rpc api?
Ex: d3a2297a90418ec41bc79f4d1474873252c3237bea7da4b64aede0926db5b1d3
as opposed to the shorter solana version
Do you have a specific question?
still in baby stage of this SOL universe haha
btw, this is my personal project
Yes, I find this is a good place to ask
Ok then this is better than general
Im looking for a way to build this analytic tools for solana
Ty
No cross posting
you guys may saw what I messaged out there in <#428295358100013069>
hello
> But for the most part I‚Äôm not a fan of mutable anything on chain
üëç
Tbh almost all do. There is a use case for this, particularly gaming or evolving NFTs, and possibly after initial mint in case metadata is screwed up. But for the most part I‚Äôm not a fan of mutable anything on chain
(good reminder to not buy NFTs that still have their update authority set üòõ)
you can use the updatable metadata
If I were to try to create an NFT that burns after x days exactly, how would I go about doing that? Could I leverage Metaplex's given code and alter it to suit the use case? Is this possible?
make a wallet with only the NFTs to send out and batch send to the list of users.
less transactions will make it less hard to handle
Sent you a friend request
There is a bulk airdropper in here
https://github.com/cyriimm
probably have to write a script that transfers them 1by1 to your target users
What about over 2000+ different addresses?
Yeah half has been minted to the community, and we want to airdrop the remaining to those addresses that minted
but yes you can airdrop, but if the token is not minted yet, you need to mint and then airdrop (can be done in the same tx)
Well do you have the tokens minted already (so in a wallet), or not yet?
Half the supply has been minted but the other half has not. Can the remaining be airdropped?
without minting? so you minted the nfts already?
hello everyone can i create pda from fronted with two public key instead of seeds  


    let pda = PublicKey.createProgramAddress(sender.PublicKey,programId);
What does this mean on the frontend `Transaction simulation failed: This program may not be used for executing instructions`
How do you take a snapshot and distribute NFTs without minting, to the people who already bought? Any help please
Hey all, was quite confused how to filter with memcmp's offset and bytes in the getProgramAccounts api. May I know are there any guides explain how to use these parameters? Thanks.
is there an equivalent to the `coinbase` address for solana? specifically, i want to redirect a % of validator rewards to another address dynamically on-chain. i saw that there's an authorized withdrawer keypair, but using this seems unsafe + the transfer wouldn't be automatic and you would have to keep withdrawing regularly
Hey everyone. I'm running into an issue on devnet: `This program may not be used for executing instructions`
much better experience generally using WSL on windows.
It's a mint I created myself on DevNet. Trying to find the mints I created
Error: Solana Rust BPF toolchain is not available on Windows. Is developing on windows not possible?
if they have their own discord you can try there
Which wallet address do I need to put into this tool to retrieve mints? https://sol-nft.tools/

I tried putting the wallet address that I used to create the mint, but that doesn't give me anything
I have a script and notice sometimes my tx doesn't get written. It just disappears. 
I am assuming this is because the network is congested, is even possible at 50k tps?
Any advice on what I should look for?
That is correct. The current expiry is 32 blocks
How do I find the current expiry of a tx after the blockhash reference?
I read here it is 32 blocks - is that correct? https://medium.com/solana-labs/gulf-stream-solanas-mempool-less-transaction-forwarding-protocol-d342e72186ad
In theory could you unpack and double lamportsPerSignature ? this would have the same affect?
I can see that in the SDK - returns this I assume - https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getrecentblockhash
if you want to send tx, you need to pack `recent blockhash` in to your tx. 
when you get recent blockhash, it will return you a feeCalculator. You can use it to calculate your fee. The fee is not settable.
Thanks mate. This says you can set a max fee in the tx, but I can't see in the API docs where I can set this when sending a tx? 
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#sendtransaction
check https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/transaction-fees
When connected to phantom wallet using Solana-wallet-adapter, how can I read and display the tokens and NFTs owned by the connected wallet on the frontend?
Does Solana have gasPrice like Ethereum for this?
does anyone know what the requirement are to have nfts show up with the enhanced view in the explorer like this one? https://explorer.solana.com/address/5C345k9kQoq3fTTuLGSufhFJqRNEU5nce8PZDquh9Gfq

My DM's are open. Will give 1 SOL to whoever can help me/answer my questions
is it possible to run your own validator? and only accept tx's from specific addresses?
what's the best way to get a transaction thru when netowrk gets congested?
Hi guys
if doing this way, did you try adding programAccountKeypair as a signer?
publicKey is phantom wallet's publickey (fee payer)
`import { useWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
const { publicKey, signTransaction } = useWallet();`

this ix works, though:
`    const sendInstruction = SystemProgram.transfer(
      {
        fromPubkey:publicKey!,
        toPubkey:targetPubkey,
        lamports:LAMPORTS_PER_SOL/1000
      });`
+ is the fee payer signing the transction?
+ where is this signTransaction coming from? 
error like that can indicate a sig is missing or is not verifiable based on data presented
I'm signing like this:

`  const executeTransaction = async (transaction:Transaction) => {
    const signedTransaction = await signTransaction(transaction);
    const serializedTx = signedTransaction.serialize();
    const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(serializedTx);
    await connection.confirmTransaction(signature);
    notify({
      message: signature,
      type: "success",
    });
  }`

and creating tx:

`  const getTransaction = async () => {
    const transaction = new Transaction();
    const recentBlockhash = await connection.getRecentBlockhash();
    transaction.recentBlockhash = recentBlockhash.blockhash;
    transaction.feePayer = publicKey!;
    return transaction;
  }`
thanks
where are you including the signers?
hi, is this instruction valid?

`      const createEscrowAccountIx = SystemProgram.createAccount({
        space: TEST_ACCOUNT_DATA_LAYOUT.span,
        lamports: minLamports,
        fromPubkey: publicKey!,
        newAccountPubkey: programAccountKeypair.publicKey,
        programId: programId,
      });`

I'm trying to create an account for a program. I get publicKey from solana-wallet-adapter-react, programId from .json while building the program and programAccountKeypair on the fly. I'm getting "Signature verification failed" error
there are lots of good tools popping up to help with many of the actions related to NFTs. there is a whole discord for NFTs and Metaplex (candymachine): cc: <@!874377961309102162> 
https://discord.gg/metaplex
with all the new products and developments going on everyone has been able to benefit off those contributing to the space and helping each other out.
Here is a small list of related resources:
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/886259112105635940/886747146827747378
the only thing to be aware of as far as I recall is cost for space. im not sure off hand of any other implications. for cost you can do cli - `solana rent <size>`  to get a rough idea of how much it may cost. I would just do your best to estimate space, give an appropriate buffer for your needs. test and go through some use cases. if it ends up not being enough, hopefully that is a good thing for your project.
ok, i will take a look at that repo
there should definitely be a FAQ with that kind of questions lol i'm pretty sure i'm not the only one
nah, I was gonna rely on that metaboss program, I haven't tried it myself just yet so i can't confirm it works, but it looks like specifically this should do it -> https://github.com/samuelvanderwaal/metaboss#get-mints

I also tried `getTokenAccountsByOwner` and wasn't successful
is it getTokenAccountsByOwner with filter program_id = address of the candy machine ?
do you know which method in RPC you have to call to get all mint addresses from a candy machine ?
but yeah it does feel like there should be an easier way to get it, I agree. But yeah otherwise getting the list of all mint addresses for a candy machine at least shouldn't be forgeable, even if it is a bit heavy handed
i had the same concern, IDK if anyone can set something to that when minting. I was originally thinking of using the creator address but that is definitely something I couldn't rely on cuz that can be set to an arbitrary value during deployment
i think we can put anything in update authority (= chose the key), but i'm not sure
yeah, I was also eyeing update authority but I am not sure as well on if that's the best way to go
seems brutal to me
yes i thought about retrieving all minting address also, but idk, doesn't feel it's the best way to go lol
<@!874377961309102162> I was trying to accomplish something similar, haven't fully implemented it yet, but I was looking at using metaboss to get a list of mint addresses from my candy machine -> https://github.com/samuelvanderwaal/metaboss

Given the list of mint addresses it should be a pretty quick lookup to make sure that a token is authentic. But yeah I haven't fully implemented it myself yet so not sure if there is a better way, but that's what I'm currently trying out. If anyone has any better approaches I'd appreciate it as well!
otherwise, when i retrieve nft from a wallet, how is it possible to be sure that the nft is authentic ?
i'm not sure if when minting an nft you can put any key in that ?
hi guys, quick question, i'm trying to find a way to authenticate an nft from a collection, is the update authority the right way ?
I thought there was a faucet for NFTs like there is for SOL.
Ah.
I mint it myself
I see, so 10MB is too large. I also would be skeptical whether we'd actually need that much space. If i had to take this "large account" approach, what's a sane number if I may ask? Would somethingl ike 102400 bytes (0.1MB) be too large?

Also hwat's the implication of having really large PDAs?
is it possible to consistently send two transactions in the same slot?
Yes you can make page in devnet
Yes, that is a youtube video.
Is there a page that has some demo NFTs I can mint on devnet?
Yes, I am using candy machine to mint them right now, but I still have to configure everything myself.
You can use NFT candy machine
<@!190473271228104704>
I have been minting them myself for testing, but is there an easier way?
OK, quick question, how did you get an NFT on devnet?
!!!!!!!! it works, thanks a lot, donno how I didn't try that ^^

Background: I'm rebuilding transaction data for a few accounts from scratch and the block_time values are slightly off for a few transactions from the last time I pulled the data.
<@!590982495923732511> any idea ? üòÆ or another way to transfer nft in javascript or other
Did you specify devnet in the solana config?

on devnet it is
GuBvCoAyAnVn8A2sgt4zqbvXNLHunWkS9DKsMNxgKFeY is not an account.
https://explorer.solana.com/address/GuBvCoAyAnVn8A2sgt4zqbvXNLHunWkS9DKsMNxgKFeY
Hi!, i'm trying to send NFT from my wallet to another using Solana CLI on devnet, i'm using this command:

spl-token transfer GuBvCoAyAnVn8A2sgt4zqbvXNLHunWkS9DKsMNxgKFeY 1 DgrTgpRbLRR9aEkVjamYn8yd87rxEbRro1Gw7PhBqsHo --fund-recipient

GuBvCoAyAnVn8A2sgt4zqbvXNLHunWkS9DKsMNxgKFeY is the token account of the NFT associated to my wallet (keypair set in CLI config)
DgrTgpRbLRR9aEkVjamYn8yd87rxEbRro1Gw7PhBqsHo is my second wallet public key

It throw me this error:
Account could not be parsed as token account: pubkey=DVu1jnVW7xDfwLd576nzsXSHKu2CxRjgM5QjNFrTfCQB

Any idea ? thanks !
> but pays for it through a wallet of AR that Solana maintains?
~~Solana~~ Metaplex.
So if I understand you. Metaplex charges the user in SOL; and then shuffles the data into Arweave, as a regular arweave transaction, but pays for it through a wallet of AR that Solana maintains?
Sadly, removing sudo didn't work either, and will do.
<@!807102567159038013> ping me on the metaplex server if this doesn't fix it.
I suspect it is reading the wrong config file.
Although in your case try removing `sudo` before the command.
Thank you so much
The metaplex server is the right place.

Hey everyone, I'm 13 and I just started developing in Solana and I'm making an NFT project based off an old friend of mine, I've made a Metaplex / Candy Machine minting website before, but I'm making a new one and I'm getting an error when I'm updating the date

10mb is the max account size, but I would not aim for that. you should be ok with your above if you need the space.  the later part is more a question on data model design choices and implementation. im not sure what might be best for your particular case.
Ok thanks
Hey, does anyone know how to get all addresses that minted from a candy machine? Trying to find out a way to do this without a bunch of manual work
Still, their implementation may give you insight
no other solana library
im trying to do this with only python requests
did you look at the python SDK to see how they are doing it?
in order
or the steps
or what is the flow that i should do?
what should i put in the headers
i cant send a transaction

hi all, i try to install solana tool suite on windows 10 but when i try to run .exe i get this message error : The system cannot execute the specified program

Has any one experienced?
When I create Provider of project-serum/anchor, I got this error

Hi all
some mentioned Solana RPCs: runnodes, quicknode, figment, rpcpool
There isn't any.  Data and code are separated on Solana.  You can view your mint address on the explorer
There's no source code.  All SPL Tokens reuse the same token program executable: https://explorer.solana.com/address/TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA
This is different than say ERC20, where tokens also provide their own implementation
My question was poorly worded. I created token using this documentation and command prompt: https://spl.solana.com/token. Where I can find my token source code when it's already created?
Hi, i'm just developing on the Solana web3 js api and running into 429 errors. So I'm looking for free or cheap reliable RPC endpoint that I can use for dev purposes. Would love to hear your recs, currently I'm looking at the $9/mo Quicknode plan.

Guys I am having a silimar issue i created a wallet in CLI but when I recover in sollet the address is different even though there is Sol in the wallet?
nah, seems easier to just make a new address. Thanks for helping though!
Just want to use once the seed to derive the first N addresses, public keys.
I don't want to store private keys.
What I really want to do is get the first N addresses written to a file. How do I modify that command to do that?
Worked like magic. Thank you.
ok thanks
Nope
Does this require that phantom is installed and set up in the same machine where the CLI is being used?
Every when are transaction fees adjusted and what is the basis for adjustment? If let‚Äôs say sol price goes up quickly and significantly, will transaction fees adjust in time?
key=1/0‚Äô is the second address in the same phantom wallet and so on
try `solana-keygen recover 'prompt:?key=0/0' -o phantom-wallet.json`
How can I make the Solana CLI derive the same addresses that Phantom derives for a given seed phrase? It is giving me different addresses.
every when are the transaction fees adjusted?
so what is the question then?
as long as its a valid address and type it should be fine.  did you try using the CLI to investigate and show some information?
No, I want people to be able to put string of any length, I would just hash it or something to store and let people retreive the actual string with it when they want to.
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html
an option in rust: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html
also you can use things like size_of, .len, among other methods to check for lengths of things as well.
may want to be looking at rust more
A Phantom-generated wallet account
If I use the same seed phrase to import a wallet to both Phantom and the Solana CLI, will they both generate the same addresses, in the same order? How can I make them derive the same wallet addresses from a single seed?
no. but if the network your on the same address has no funds, or is of a wrong account type, then yes. what type of an account is it?
Can you direct me to some resources? that would be very helpful.
What makes a payer invalid? It was the same account as I'm using on mainnet, may that be an issue?
from the program end you you can have validation checks and or use the appropriate data types in rust, from the client end, you can do some validation checks where able as well.
try to print your `source_account_info` and `prgoram_id` on rust and node js
I think your code is right.
oh.  `let validProgramAddress ` is a array contain [pda, bump_seed]
In short..... one that will MINT NFT's at launch.... instead of doing it manually, by having to select the Wallet, click on MINT...
asking how to create a bot may not be the best approach, you may want to ask how to do certain things. creating a bot is not directly related. if you want to know how to create and use NFTs and related resources you can get all the info here:

Hi guys, how can I ensure a string input in the contract to be of constant length by some manipulation?Ex, if I accept names from users and store them, how can I ensure that storage capacity of every name string remains constant.
Can you get your address banned from devnet or something? I started getting an error that just says `Transaction simulation failed: This account may not be used to pay transaction fees` . Doesn't happen with a new wallet I just made
Although you might want to confirm if that is intended behaviour on the ARWeave Discord.
ARWeave preserves them across the redirect.

hey everyone, i'm doing a system_instruction::transfer() and whenever i try to do small amounts, e.g. 6000 lamports, the account I send them to only receives for example, 5954 lamports.

Hello! Is there any way to get block by using block number or block hash, via JSON rpc
perhaps this already exists?
When minting tokens using a metaplex candy machine, only one "treasury" address can be set. Am I right in thinking it should be fairly trivial to create an on-chain program which can automatically divide any solana sent to it between wallets, and set that as a treasury address?
llvm-objdump can disassemble to source BPF assembly but going from that to Rust is a bigger challenge
Good point, I just reached out to the authors. Any idea how I would go about reverse engineering the instruction data from existing, valid transactions ? I've noticed that they all begin and end the same but the middle is different so I think that's a clue.
Can someone help me undersand how "Serum's order flow and liquidity" enbles limit orders that other DEX's cant do .  Im wondering if its because of how fast SOL can produce blocks?
Hi was wondering, why is it Raydium DEX can support limit orders but other blockchains DEX cant?

I understand Raydium is pulling data from Serum?  

Is it cause Serum is able to pull pricing data fast and write to blockchain fast (400ms) so Raydium can read that data quick enough to create charts / limit orders?

solana_client RpcClient doesn't work anymore, even with 1.7.14 which is in sync with the node i am talking to
Are the program authors available or is the program supported in anyway? There is currently no 'decompile' from the BPF bytes codes of a program back to the Rust source.
Hey how can I go about deducing what instruction data I need to send to a program that has no published source code or documentation ?
Can a program rent be claimed back?

while you can burn it to save some SOL
Thank you. Yes, that's the one I used. Phantom doesn't recognise it, so I sent to a Sollet burner wallet and into the flames from there.
sending it to a burn address is dumb because you have to pay for a token account
burn it with the burn function in solflare
I believe this is the solana burn address: https://medium.com/solana-labs/solana-foundation-permanently-removes-11-365m-from-token-supply-dd58c8db8d0d 1nc1nerator11111111111111111111111111111111 https://explorer.solana.com/address/1nc1nerator11111111111111111111111111111111
do you have any experience on how to mint new token-accounts using the phantom wallet and react?
```await connection.getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2(programId)```

this is returning me values for 1000 transaction but the amount of transaction on this program i think easily exceeds 1000 what is up with that??
i'm trying to get all the transactions for my program!
yeah this is indeed confusing:
first of all, keep in mind that they're all addresses, i.e. all are base58 publicKeys.

The difference:
a wallet just stores an account, and the corresponding tokens

a mint is the publicKey that describes the token that can be minted. i.e. you can think of a mint as a "parent", which has authority over generating new tokens.

an `associatedTokenAccount` is an address, that has belongs to a _specified_ token (which is defined by the mint), and the owner is a solana account

does that help? i know these concepts are a bit interconnect, i think it helps the most if you play around with the `spl-token` account on devnet, and look at every address that is generated on solana-explorer!
would be curious to know as well. programming with browser-wallets is slightly different than developing using local wallets, I have some trouble minting tokens using the `use-wallet-adapter` as well
Hello Guys üëã 

Is there an equivalent of Gnosis Safe on Solana ? for multisig management

for the validator itself when logging,  if you want to view in real time, or just in general.   in a sep window in terminal solana logs -v, the other commands like sol_log you can print from within the program itself, and you can print other messages with msg! to debug or see info.
Okay bro but -v where do i use it?
did someone accidentally release a version of solana-sdk to cargo under an old version? just noticed this change bc my code stopped compiling: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/compare/v1.7.12...v1.8.1#diff-8bf829cafa4d83c28318511be76cdf37b5e00c7c363778c312aef103114f6b2cR415

alrights, let me try 
thanks pal!
you should be able to build from source.  following the instructions in the solana install docs and or github, readme.
i3, 8gb ddr4
ubuntu 20.04
by default looks like no. whats spec are u running on
oops, so I can't develop on the current pc apparently yeah?
next time you can do  sol_log_compute_units() and that should print the remaining compute units. you can do this between calls or during execution to see whats eating memory.  you can also view the logs that may have some relevant info. can also use -v with logs to get verbose if running RT.
run with --log and see if you can get anymore info
it works now and honestly i dont think i changed much ahaha!!
Thanks
I mean something like console.log in javascript
how would I check/print it out for inspections?
Honestly not really sure what‚Äôs going on here. Something is eating up your compute budget

ooh shit üòÜ  thanks mate
No need for custom smart contract either
They could even trade, sell transfer outside the game
Why not just let the wallet be the users identity/inventory and each item, attribute is its own NFT with metadata within their wallet? And they could even take these to other games or the metaverse
swolana?
Gotta spell it right
I have a question about this strategy for a project, very high level, really asking if it would work
Could I:
1. Deploy a smart contract - something like a counter. Imagine 10 counters, for a game, like a user characters attributes
2. Mint NFT‚Äôs of those characters w attributes (onchain) w an Arweave HTML file associated too
3. The real question - Pack a game into that HTML file, that reads those attributes and uses the Solana JS library to interact w the smart contract, visualize / play using those attributes 
Kind of feels like there a chicken and egg problem of the Arweave HTML file needing to communicate w the smart contract, but not being able to until after it‚Äôs minted
Hello everyone. 
I just started learning solana and was doing anchor framework tutorial and run to the following problem... does anyone know how to reproduce this? googling wasn't helpful...
Hi is anyeone having probs with devnet right now
Trying to sign transacttions and things are getting timed otutt
Does anybody learn about the solarian nfts? Seems they have a different format with metaplex
<@!804350183105363980>
via cli
Hey <@!788215642070581289> are you aware how to find the public program address of the value ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
I have this code in my smart contract 

pub(crate) fn get_distributor_token_address_with_seed(
    source_account_info: &Pubkey,
    program_id: &Pubkey
) -> (Pubkey, u8) {
    Pubkey::find_program_address(
        &[&source_account_info.to_bytes()],
        program_id,
    )
}

It returns me with X pubkey if i send my program pubkey and sender pubkey


Now i have this code in node js but it returns me Y pubkey instead of X pubkey as my smart contract. What's wrong here ?

  let source_account_info = new PublicKey("public_key_address_is_here") ;
  let program_id = new PublicKey("Program_id_public_key_address_is_here");    let validProgramAddress = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress([source_account_info.toBuffer()], program_id);
I was trying to figure out why it wasn't working from my side, but I just was encoding the size in big-endian instead of little-endian
sorry got distracted
okay, eventually figured it out: length is the string length (little-endian), padding is 0 (as a u32), and the string is the actual string
don't get why you can't just serialize the string into bytes and call it a day
linked to it above
ah, let me clarify: there's these layouts called "rustString" used in the SystemProgram that I don't really get

nevermind then üòõ

is there a max limit to how much you can fetch at once w/ getMultipleAccountInfos? I don't see it listed in the docs, is it just the rpc's throughput so 100MB/30s?
I don't quite understand how web3.js encodes string literals into Buffers: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/4fb1c9da26950849427d80c34c14940f0171a9fe/web3.js/src/layout.ts#L23
what's the point of length and lengthPadding? they don't seem to be referenced anywhere else.
Would be nice if you can clean up your earlier comments.  They were pretty out of line
Good luck with the hackathon
Yes apologies. I understand that you understand my frustration. We will be patient - people have just been on us about it.
Everyone is now aware. We are working on a better strategy but you must understand that we‚Äôve been in the middle of a hackathon and the team has been at capacity. It is not personal. Once it is reviewed it will be merged. The best approach is to ping the PR on occasion to raise awareness. ü§ù

Whats up guys, i was messing around with trying to make a 1 of 1 and was wondering if anyone had any insight on how to get tokens to show up as `immutable` when viewing on explorer? 

The token that I made has the `isMutable: 1`  property attached to it in the on-chain token metadata still. And trying to find some documentation on it hasn't been successful. LMK if anyone has any insight please! Thanks ‚úä
There a is huge backlog for this and they don‚Äôt get updated regularly. You are not the only team waiting. I understand your frustration, but this channel is for technical developer support. Not name calling and complaints. It will get merged but this is not the correct forum or approach.
Chase -- who do we talk to about an ecosystem merge that just doesn't appear to be happening? It's very important to us. Lots of time and money sunk into our project. Also confused investors wondering why it isn't listed on the ecosystem.

Ohhhh. Nvm. I know what you mean.
Not sure understand. That link works for me. Where is the link located ?
Closer link to the problem https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/#examples

<@!455114989397868556> ‚òùÔ∏è
just a heads up that the web3 examples link here (https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/) is a dead link
They behave the same, but a wallet (esp. hardware) can't accurately display `transfer`
The token mint and decimals are implicit with `transfer`, explicit with `transferChecked`
Thank you so much <@!788215642070581289>
Oh yeah, understand
a token account can only hold one specific mint. so your USDC token account and SRM token account will be different.
in the other words. when you specify token account, you have already chose a mint.
transferChecked allows me to decide what is the token I want to transfer (like USDC, ...), but the transfer is not.
AFAIK this isn‚Äôt document anywhere
both of them can transfer token,  transferChecked do more check things for you.
https://discord.gg/metaplex
You are going to get a better answer in the metaplex discord since they are the ones that support the metadata standard. It‚Äôs not directly related to core Solana programs
How this transfer know what the token I want to transfer?
What is the difference between transferChecked and this transfer (https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/c8963e8348f42541270ca4cd99e0a76f0e41fd8b/token/js/client/token.js#L862) ?

I have the upgrade authority for it
and I want the user to be able to change the metadata of the NFT from a front end that I am making
the phantom related code for the adapter should be here:
https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/blob/master/packages/wallets/phantom/src/adapter.ts
for anything else you may have to check the phantom docs:
https://github.com/phantom-labs
it would probably help to walk through this utilizing some of the commands to understand some. 
https://spl.solana.com/token
a quick summary might be:
`wallet` from a plugin / phantom wallet perspective is a secure way to use your keypair/sign for transactions, and associated the wallet address (public key) with your account for sending/retrieving funds, paying for transactions, and signing.
an 'account' is an address that can hold data and may have properties like owner, authority, etc that may determine who can modify the data. accounts are owned by a program, for example the spl-token program, when creating an spl-token account.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts
a `mint` is a type of account with properties and functions that can do things like 'mint to' an address, has a supply etc.
a `token account`, is created by specifying the 'mint' account, so that the token is associated with a particular mint. the token account holds the token balance 'like usdc'
a token account is generally associated with a users wallet address, or an account address, and searching associated accounts of a users address is how you/wallets show the tokens (spl-token accounts) that user has associated with their wallet/account address. the token usually has an authority (or token owner) that would be the wallet/address that has authority on the token. the underlying owner is the spl-token program (because the token account was created for and with the spl-token program, program id)

the docs.solana.com and spl.solana.com docs are good resources for more in depth and walking through some scenarios.
like you can only run a validator ?

This is very dangerous.
I highly suggest that developers follow the SOL100 ecosystem situation closely. I will be providing updates as far and wide and loud as possible.
We have sunk tens of thousands of dollars into this - and some guy in an ivory tower just decides that we aren't part of the Solana ecosystem? Because our project is a simple token? Who is in charge here?
Why isn't SOL100 being merged after WEEKS? The original pull was closed and replaced with a new one to shine attention on this issue. This is a matter of knee-jerk "Oh no, this just won't do. This isn't Solana material." - This is a **major problem** for the Solana ecosystem.

Hi guys, 
Anyone experiences on how to get wallet details from wallet adapter, let us say Phantom? In my case, I am testing with demo from this github: https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter. I would like to find the resources files that send the connection request events and returns the response but still stuck until now.
Hope can share some files or path relevant to it. Thanks.
Maybe that‚Äôs gibberish, if so feel feee to tell me as much üòÜ
For instance when creating a mint, i use create an account using my wallet. How do these interact and how can I track back to this wallet from the token itself.
Hey all, having a really hard time understanding the relationship between a wallet, account, mint, and a token. 

Does anyone have any dev resources to help understand how these interact?
yep
if i want to add this data to a transaction instruction can i just straight up copy paste it from solscan?
got it. Thanks for the explanation
Yep. There's a couple places, like this, where we've unfortunately overloaded the word "owner".
I gave the ownership of a token account to my program and I could not transfer anything, but in the case of a token account the owner is not really my program, it just mean that the owner should sign.
oh... I think I understood my mistake, got a bit confused.
The program has full authority over all accounts it's the owner for.  So the program itself gets to decide what input (transaction signatures, instruction data) would trigger it to close an account
hey all, i was wondering if there's an established best practice for 'exporting' archive data? i remember reading something about a bigtable exporter - does this exist?
you could assign a pda as a owner, so in this case you can sign, but the program can't modify the data
but how can the program transfer sol if you cannot sign ?
Once the data account is owned by a program, only the program can do this.  Some programs provide an instruction to do this, others don't
Hello, In my mind, you can transfer back the rent of an account and it will deinitialize it,  but what if the data account is owned by a program ?  How can I transfer back the rent when I cannot sign ?

Look at the rewards for the block that the transaction landed in.  You paid all the validators some lamports: https://explorer.solana.com/block/102621000/rewards
not sure how i never noticed that
otherwise the db would have a infinity of accounts
of course, accounts are created when lamports
oh eh hahah
there is rent for that?
yep, a tiny amount that is not rent exempt
it is a sol transfer
rent ate it.
no

Where is the extra SOL?
Exactly.  The program account itself is just code: think the `bin/ls` executable.  Whenever you run `ls`, it doesn't modify `bin/ls`
dang justt realized...my bad
lol i just shared that
Read this arrticle. It helps https://2501babe.github.io/posts/solana101.html
amazing thank you
nahh . So you can use this command $ solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/devnet.json to create a new wallet while on devnet. I saved my previous wallets public key and seed phrase. Now via cli, I am trying to revert back to old wallet pubkey. HOw do I do this?
so when I transfer a spl token to address A, the spl token program modifies the data in address A instead of modifying it's own data?
if you're coming from eth, read this
https://2501babe.github.io/posts/solana101.html
this is one of the pain points for anyone coming from solidity
literally everything in solana is an account. wallets, programs, data. they are all accounts, except programs are marked executable.
that'll do, more dense but I'll work with it
We didn't build a spec, we built a blockchain
I can offer you the source code üôÇ
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana
ethereum is weird tho in that their implementation is based on that spec, the other way around is actually way more practical to build
> how to revert back to an old solana wallet
Can you asking about how to install an older version of the solana command-line tools?
it's more technical than a whitepaper. Ethereum's for example: https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf
hi quick bump! This is for devnet
Both!
For example, an SPL Token amount is just data.
never heard of a yellow paper or never heard of a solana yellow paper?
I've never heard of such a thing, so no
why would anyone want to hold data?
also is there a solana yellow paper?
to hold data
what's the purpose of the owner-controlled state (Account::data) on solana?
contacts...err...programs must be rent-exempt to be marked executable, so they never disappear
no, there's no need for rent at all!  An account with 0 lamports in it is still fully able to "do work".  It just can't pay for transactions or otherwise store any value on chain
The owner never has to exist on chain.  It's balance is irrelevant to the existence of it's owned accounts
are contract accounts garbage collected if they don't have enough rent? Let's say a user has a proxy wallet and they just spent all their funds, would the proxy wallet then disappear?
i don't know why i have a mental block on this part
so once rent is added, it's good to go again
eg. a paper wallet
yeah but that doesn't matter.  A (user) account address is just an ed25519 public key.  It can sign transactions without a corresponding account existing on-chain
can they not be garbage collected if they have no rent left?
yes it is the case that an account doesn't need a balance to own tokens.
in theory a contract verifies a signature of the signature of an inactive account then acts as if the call was from that address. Does that work?
interesting but doesn't really answer my question regarding an inactive account having a token balance
Bump! üôÇ
Hello hello, one question, is it possible to use the `sendAndConfirmTransaction` function without having to pass the Keypair ? I'd like to sign but I can't find a way without me pushing to my react app the private key ...
tthis is for dev ttesting
hi all, from the CLI do you know how to revert back to an old solana wallet if you hahve the pubkey and seedphrase
hello world !
Do someone have a solution to convert insturction data to ascii string in javascript ?

For example:
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4D3uGrYRDMSERxDU53GLYCcA3aqU6DM9UWS1bygzfEehBcV7WVRHonMrQGDiEMNh6EEcMADPFkPXvTcUCue7xdnj

I get the instruction data in my code using connection.getParsedConfirmedTransaction()

I get the data encoded in Base64 I guess. 2 hours I try to convert it to have the same result than if I take the epxlorer hex code and convert it using a site like https://string-functions.com/hex-string.aspx

Thanks you
this will give you the best explanation

https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts#rent
what does it mean to be active? I assume it means have an entry on the ledger? On EVM chains accounts can have an erc20 balance without actually holding the token. It's just a mapping from the account address to their balance. So you're saying I can't create a token that gives an inactive account a balance? I presume it should still be a mapping in the storage of the contract between an address and it's balance but maybe storage on solana is different
def a barrier of entry no doubt
it's a good point although solana wallets require "rent" in sol to even become active, so you have to have it regardless. the onus is typically on the person who creates that wallet. for instance, the platform they use will pay that rent when the wallet is created. wallets like phantom also provide swapping, so that might be the solution where you swap whatever coin you have for a certain amount of sol
cool thanks
depends what currency that app users. If it's mainstream focused and doesn't use SOL then you don't want normies to have to buy sol as well as the stable coin your app uses

i don't see a real need for a gas station on solana since it's so cheap

Hey new to solana üëã  I'm curious if there's any services on solana comparable to graph protocol and gas station network on ethereum?
you can also try solhack

https://discord.gg/k8C36NdB
not really so much in discord. twitter is where all the solana crypto people are. you can probably find those groups just following accounts and networking
also make sure you have enough sol to perform the tx, this is a common issue that people forget about
https://discord.gg/aaYAq5Jt
not sure if this the right place to ask but is there a channel or forum to discuss new projects brainstorm ideas specifically for non-crypto background folks. My background is in EV's and have a few ideas where solana might help but haven't a clue about any of this stuff

You guys, always monkeying around
Thank you fellow primate.
It does exactly what you want üôÇ
Check this out
Do you happen to have a basic bash script for solana CLI that I could look at? I've never written a bash script and it'll be much easier to start modifying one.
hmhm ok, thank you.
Either way, you can structure the script that feeds the response to the Approve prompt... I believe... haven't tried it
When you do a transfer using the hardware wallet for a transfer and CLI, does it prompt for approval?
You using Ledger?
https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/hardware-wallets#supported-hardware-wallets
Ahhh good question
If I do this connected to a hardware wallet, still via CLI, will I have to manually press approve 100 times on the ledger, or can I approve once for a batch of transactions?
Good idea. Thank you.
bash script using solana CLI for transfers?
Call it twice a week. Likely the same set of addresses, or changing twice a month.
One time shot or ongoing?
If I have a list of 100 addresses I want to send 1 SOL each to, what's the easiest/best way to do it? For example, is there a wallet that supports adding CSVs as recipient address?

this is quite common approach in data structures. when structure is not fixed but dynamic. like a variable length of the fields. non constant
yes. length is number of elements (bytes) in array. basically you compactify length with this technique. it's like if most of the arrays will be quite small -- you can use only one byte to store its length, but if it's bigger you still can extend this without destroying existing format for small arrays
If I want to display the current block hash live on a website, what is the best place to read that from?
Could you tell me why we just use 14bits instead 16bits in case the length is greater or equal to 2bytes? Does length means the number of elements of array right ?
to be honest I maybe messed up a bit with some values, but main principle is something like that üôÇ
think of it as very simple method as archive programs (like rar, zip, etc.) do to pack data into smaller size
this rules said that if you will have array length less than 127 (0x7F) you can encode this length with only one byte, but if it is bigger you set highest bit to 1 and use 7 bits from next byte in same manner, so with 2 bytes your length may be increased from 127 up to 16383 (0x3fff, because of maximum for 14 bit (7+7)) so now you will use 2 bytes to encode length of the array. and so on and so on. you can increase value of the length, but exact amount of bytes you need for it is not fixed. it's dynamic.
so it means that for small arrays you always will use only one byte for length. in millions of transactions it may same really lot amount of ledger/traffic
but if you have tools to handle such data-structures you can skip this deep diving and just use existing API(interfaces)
bits are counting from low to high. from right to left. byte=8bit, so if you use multibyte data, you can group bits in byte-groups and so byte order maybe the same -- from lower to higher (but it depends on convention). this is very basic of low level structure of computer memory, you know, from transistors you can build trigger, if you you unite 8 triggers together you get register, registers maybe multiplexed into arrays of memory and so on.
very simple!
Could anyone please explain me what does compact-u16 format mean ? I find it so difficult to understand this theory. May the array be bigger than 16bits ? What is lower 7bits ?  Thank you in advanced.
Does anyone have a working example of @solana/wallet-adapter-vue out of curiosity?

Hey gm! What if I want to "stake" an nft to receive an spl-token as reward over time?
Hi did you get a fix for this - I am having the same issue.
Created a wallet in CLI and in Sollet and Solflare the seed recovers an empty wallet?!
<#763249718339567626>
Gm, could anyone point me to where in the solana codebase I can learn more about how accounts work? I‚Äôd prefer reading the code directly than the docs
Hello @here I need a NFT program and a small minting app. Please let me know if someone can help me. I will pay for that!
Are there any stake system docs guys
I'm also looking for a blockchain that will support me build my idea with proper funding.
Hello Solana community! I'm a developer looking for a chain that will support me build my awesome dapps? Is there anyone here I can help me assist into achieving my goal?

Hello,
I am having an issue when trying to create my candy machine. Error procedsing instruction 0: Custom program error: 0x0. 
Did someone already faced this issue ? Thanks for your help.
Regards.
try installing curl with apt instead of snap that worked for me
well.. it's obviously your system issue, not related to solana at all. maybe some `psysh` specific behavior (even though you call `sh` explicitly)
in fact your curl said it can't save downloaded file (error 23)
same result
Hey guys!!!
is there any NFT swap feature available on solana?
try add `sudo` before command
please how can i solve this issue
sorry to disturb you man but still can't get  this solved
hey all, am I right in thinking that an spl token account is a normal Solana account, but owned by the token program?
hi guys, i'm looking for a developer to do some on chain analysis on Solana for me üôÇ Pretty simple stuff, looking at addresses and such. LMK!
also you can do 
solana confirm -v 4dcJVUk7MMWepPTMXrtfRfiEP7UJ7CNTi19ENwkGCP5N39acUb2oxd4imVNfPaqNSQDJAU9
this is expected sometime
this is your txhash 4dcJVUk7MMWepPTMXrtfRfiEP7UJ7CNTi19ENwkGCP5N39acUb2oxd4imVNfPaqNSQDJAU9
Hi, I would like to get all the existed account data recently.
Is there any snapshot I can download? And could it be parsed to json or other format?
so in ethereum nodes have multiple modes for example , there's the full node option and there's the archive nodes which keeps the record of all the blockchain data.

so in solana , what's the equivalent node type for something like ethereum's archive nodes ?

token meta data like your describing, for now, can be added for the ecosystem by filling out a PR here:
https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list
Hello, I created a token using a spl-token following the cli, however, I was wondering if I can modify the token metadata so that I can see the name and symbol. I tried changing on phantom wallet for my updateAuthority, which it works on my end. However, when after I airdrop to different address, the token name/symbol is not shown
<@!209864015071936512> this is a ghetto solution, but chop off the first byte and parse the rest as number:     `console.log(data.slice(1).readBigInt64LE().toString());`, returns 2000000000
no idea on first look what the `06` is
(maybe something to identify the method handler?)
hm. might actually be the hex. `060094357700000000` is the decoded. ah. well there we go. it's a base58 of a hex number value. thanks so much <@!137101040687382528> !
and the tx metadata has the logs like you see at the bottom of the explorer
the partial instruction just gives me ```parsed instruction
partially decoded
program_id CJsLwbP1iu5DuUikHEJnLfANgKy6stB2uFgvBBHoyxwz
accounts ["HW5bJMT7CqnzbqSZixhAu9tNpNHV2DrJM5XZctEpouJh", "BX7kB2qd9dcT6oRH6PgbmysmK2CX1qrwsWptAf7w6MP", "83ZvM95YoQL5NxHFJBbdsZAShwWamXpjEPDqCHQSvHgp"]
data 5S1jx7tfFTbu```
this doesn't really answer your question but the new price of 2000000000 is readable in the hex of the instruction data:  `06 00 94 35‚ÄÉ77 00 00 00‚ÄÉ00‚ÄÉ`
00 94 35 77 -> 0x77359400 = 2000000000 üòÑ
haha yeah I'd definitely not rely on those logs
transaction data is base-58 per the Transaction docs (https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#transaction-structure)
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/2ct7YtMPk7MyQkS36TUr6N87jH8MEwt25Fvw6BZZktTLQ7hFPnCDKvM7yuKChN3dckwSSGjWraKLivYd9bYUEQ1s
do you have a transaction link I could look at? Also not sure how to decode the instruction data without knowing the format in advance but wanna take a look
I guess you could even put web3 in a nodejs server and build an entire web3 application without a onchain program ü§î
been trying to read nft transactions and seems like they're largely reliant upon those existing calls
one nice thing about solana is that for most things you might not even need a onchain program. Interacting with programs means you can for example use spl-token program to create a new token, mint something, change authority
Or use system program to create accounts, etc. 
Of course you'll still run into limitations eventually but there's a lot of stuff that can be done
i can see the price change in the UiTransactionStatusMeta `log_messages` but it seems shaky to rely upon logs
speaking of JSON RPC i have a question about the JSON RPC client in Rust. I'm trying to track some transactions but have run into a wall with Instruction Data: `UiParsedInstruction::PartiallyDecoded` has a data field value of `5S1jx7tfFTbu` which is a string - is there a way to read values out of that string (in this case, the transaction in question is a price change on an NFT and I'm pretty sure the only place that actual price change could be is in that instruction text. )
programs (smart contracts) (on solana) have no state. they just do things to update the state of the blockchain using the very root of it all the JSON RPC API  ( the literal interface to the solana blockchain for anyone reading this)
I'm pretty sure I will need to use rust for my project
it's the emphasis on `programs` in the SOL sense vs general programming sense that can be kind of tricky to wrap your head around (and i'm still having to make sure i keep in mind)
so afaik you can interact with existing `programs` on the chain using the SDKs (including javascript). Rust is required to write the contracts that, when deployed, are programs that can be called
I believe that means there are certain blockchain operations you need to use Rust for, and others that you don't, and those others are enough to make a lot of apps
open to any feedback you may have
was the article unclear? are you a developer ?
hey i wrote that üôÇ
thanks, so is the JS sdk a good place to start then? Or should I jump straight into rust?
dapps = javascript frontend stuff the user interacts with
own program = actual stuff running onchain

they mean that you can do a lot of stuff with just javascript like interacting with the token program, etc
hey, I'm interested in getting into solana development. I'm reading some intro material and came across this:
```As mentioned previously, you aren‚Äôt required to know Rust or understand on-chain programs to build on Solana, although once you‚Äôre comfortable with building dApps you‚Äôll likely want to learn how to create your own programs.```
What is the different between "dApps" and "your own programs"?Why can't I use JS to create my own programs?
now I can start development üòÑ
sick, it works
haha ok
<@!811633301747531786> just fixed that. Give it a git pull

Hello, in my program I am creating tokenAccount for a PDA but it fails because of ownership issue, what should be the owner of instruction 1 (create_account) and 2(intialize_account) ?   I tried few things but instruction 2 is still failing
doesn't hurt to try
shall I use 16 for now?
oh there is 17 already, let me do a quick upgrade to try it out
I nuked the node modules and no change. node 17.0.0
what node version you on? I just purged my node_modules and did 
```
yarn

if you have the authority you can just burn them no?  spl-token burn instructions/cli.
which actually removes them from supply
the spl token program has a burn instruction
Trying to burn some nfts in a collection
what are you trying to accomplish with a global burn wallet?
The exiled apes repo has a simple example of a front end that can be used along with wallet adapter
Hello, is there a global burn wallet?
welcome to mainframe programming
hmm
a big part of the shift to fat clients is because as the ruby people learned its a lot more scalable to outsource as much computing as possible to the user
dunno. i mean. everything is the way it is because of historical path dependence. web standards are so complicated its virtually impossible to make a new rendering engine now, even microsoft had to capitulate and switch to blink. js is such a nightmare in part because node has gotten crammed in there because devs didnt want to think about backend vs frontend js apis. esm modules are a fucking nightmare. weve gotten to the point that people build frameworks on top of frameworks. i would love for a cleansing of the augean stables but i dont know how you accomplish that without throwing everything in the trash and starting over (in which case you would be feature anemic compared to the web and hard to use and have no userbase etc etc etc)
(kinda sad clojurescript didn't become more popular)
typescript is pretty cool yea
I'm a backend dude mainly but I don't mind doing frontend stuff with typescript+react at all these days
IMO typescript made everything a loooot nicer
what do you mean trying to use ledger?
lol i think the whole front end ecosystem is about to go full circle though .. i think we've reached the peak of max complexity
for 95% of the cases, just use CRA and react
just put the files you need in script tags and off to the races!!
do you know what can be the reason? trying to use ledger
this is the nodejs peoples fault, it was fine before browserify opened the pandoras box
ü§£  its what keeps me going
yea im on this incredible journey after trying to use vue for a few weeks and constantly running into build issues because its all webpack/babel/etc bullshit
..  thats a wild combo
hella framework skettie .  front end devs are like real devs now.. its wild.
the main reason its so complicated is it has tons of leftover gunk from when it apparantly used to be a lending program?
tempted to do the same with plain html and js. Not everyone knows react / wants to use react .. e.g. me lol. Im more of an Angular / Svelte person
if that helps
I'm gonna publish a little starter kit today in my lunch break üòÑ
haha
ive gotten the dapp scaffold working in the past so probably i should start with that and delete as much of the unnecessary things first
but it's really not that hard, especially with react. You add the provider to your App.tsx, and then you can use the hooks to access the users wallet
that would be awesome!
i am a simple solana program dev wandering out of necessity into clicky uxy dependency helly places i dont belong üòõ
I'll see if I can piece a simple template together üôÇ
dvcrn! please share your starting template..  help these guys out üòõ
lots of interest in dappscaffold but many see it as very complex.
I didn't read the entire conversation but I also built multiple frontends with wallet-adapter. If there are any specific questions I'm happy to help
he used react, but you could use the same idea for the others
yea front end has become a crazy eco system..  wild and loose now. 
if you check out, dabit anchor example:
https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-solana-development-with-react-anchor-rust-and-phantom-3291
he integrated the solana, wallet-adapter.  
and u can use that as a reference to minimally install in your front end.
anytime it says a dep is missing, you can try a yarn add or npm install, of that specific dep too.
otherwise ill just use phantom off the window object like normal and worry about the rest later
im gonna try downgrading to before people started converting to esm modules, the biggest thing ive learned in my past week of frontend excitement is esm modules break everything and should never be trusted
nah even after (re?)installing it just does ```wait  - compiling...
error - ./components/WalletConnectionProvider.tsx:1:0
Module not found: Can't resolve '@solana/wallet-adapter-base'
> 1 | import { WalletAdapterNetwork } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-base';```
yea, not looking at it atm, but its common with linking and deps in front end projects especially to have issues. 
if you had the whole repo and ran yarn from the root, it should install everything correctly.
+ also from the example root, doing install there may also work.
+ i have not tried ripping out a single project specifically, but I would think it should work.
+ you can additional try installing the base if its missing
weirdly, i had copied out the directly and assumed it was a usable root, but now i tried building it inside the full repo and get a different error about wallet-adapter-base being missing
yea i just cloned the repo like, an hour ago from HEAD. i just ran `yarn` and `yarn dev`
haha yes! awesome. is there an overall usable snippet from that working example?
<@!785084693023424542> it does work, just for general knowledge
i think the example is also now using next actually..
this sounds like a familiar older issue that should have been resolved, if not, was only a dependency issue. 
wallet adapter now has a lot of deps at the root if installing everything,  did you do that?  if not installing locally in the project with npm install should.. work.  but a yarn from the root should work as well i think.
i am a frontend noob
im not sure if these are supposed to be for public consumption or if theyre still under development but i was trying them since the dapp scaffold is really complicated
has anyone got `wallet-adapter/packages/starter/nextjs-starter` working properly? including the `WalletConnectionProvider` thing. ive run into various errors with esm modules, with it wanting some blocto wallet adapter and not finding the module, not sure if its supposed to display something when i inline the component, etc...

Is there a way to fetch NFT metadata without using anchor?
nice. let us know if it actually worked
bs is the bs58 lib
<@!785084693023424542> cheers, I think i have it done with bs.decode(phantomKey).data.toJSON() essentially
https://discord.gg/XVswJu3u
i think to get a keypair file for local from phantom, you can try running the recover like this: using any phantom info.
solana-keygen recover 'prompt:?key=0/0' -o phantom-compatible.json
Hi, I'm trying to fetch NFT metadata with anchor-js. Should I be trying to build the PDA and fetch the data using that?

  Buffer.from("metadata"),
  bs58.decode(programId),

it looks like the write buffer used may not have been large enough to handle the deploy.. some kind of mismatch here..
more information would help

Ty
or if you have a custom program  then it could provide an instruction for this
a memo instruction another
a system transfer instruction of 0 lamports would be one way
without changing the blockhash
is there a null op instruction we can use to change the transaction hash of a transaction?
are you familiar with the web3 docs and the solana explorer source code?
with web3 how can i parse the transaction information when i have the txid? i want to receive the data thats returned on explorer.solana.com

if you start running docker inside your WSL2 & need to do some intense filesystem i/o you will start seeing some performance issues due to the way the file system stuff goes through the pipes and that can be inconvenient
you need to have some service pack upgrade in order to get WSL2 - if you're using LSTC you won't be able to do this (easily)
if you're using wsl2 you can mount your WSL as a folder share in windows and use your ide to edit code directly in your WSL - it shouldn't be inconvenient at all

Thank you!
you may wanna checkout sollet as a resource. 
https://github.com/project-serum/spl-token-wallet
the solana-keygen source code likely has some useful info as well 
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/keygen
wallet docs:
https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide
in javascript, yea its probably is.   yarn add BN or npm i bn.js
Would anyone have information on the public address formatting starting from the BIP39 seed? I would like to create a wallet for Solana.
Big Sur x86_64 is a breeze
Is BN a third party library?
i would say majority are on a linux based system, but can't speak for everyone.
but what do you mean jumping from IDE and WSL?   
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl
I did not. I will try that. Thanks for your help.
since its BN, did u try just casting the string to a BN? and passing that to publicKey?
`web3.PublicKey(new BN(bKey))` ?  pass the BN instead of the string
Hi. Is Solana development much more inconvenient outside of Linux? I tried building their hello world project, and even that requires Linux. Jumping between my IDE and WSL doesn't seem the way to go longterm. Is everyone on Linux?
I retrieved it using getParsedProgramAccounts using the stake program. My assumption was that I could store this data locally since it is almost 400K plus accounts and then convert the BN after the fact. It seems at this point like I will need to base58 encode inline before storage
that appears that that value is not a base58 encoded value? how did you arrive at that value?
Yields the same error
can you not use: `new solanaWeb3.PublicKey(bKey)` ?

So simply passing a BN as a string to PublicKey.toBase58()
maybe share some code in a gist or from a link, for your process and the issue or reason can be seen. from the web3, publickey file,  toBase58 is a method on public key itself, it takes no parameters. so im not sure what u mean by pass the value as a string to a PublicKey?
retrieiving  BN from getParsedProgramAccounts with web3 for stake program and then writing to JSON file. If I later try to get a BN pubkey from the JSON file and convert to base58 using PublicKey.toBase58 it fails. It only seems to work if I pass directly as an object directly in JS as in my example above
are you storing the raw BN? or converting it first? before storing. and this is all javascript?
I mean if I get the _bn pubkey from an RPC call and store it locally to a JSON file or DB it is now a string. If I try to later grab the _bn from the local storage is now a string. If I pass the value as a sting to PublicKey.toBase58 it fails. It only seems to work if I pass it as an object directly in JS.
https://crates.io/crates/spl-token
based on your stake design you may be able to stake almost anything.
what do you mean by locally?
Is nft stake system possible?
I'm working on encoding a big number public key to base58. If I do this direct in JS as an object is works fine. Something like this:
```
const key = "4kGk6SqXvyo8DJfkdhQaoY4yCyboyCKVcyxMgrHwagqR";
const bnKey = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey(key);
console.log(bnKey);
const baseKey = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey(bnKey._bn).toBase58();
console.log(baseKey);
```
If I try to store the big number public key locally and then try to encode from a string it fails. Is there a better way to do this?
Is `InitializeAccount3` not part of the published spl token crate yet?

hi community how i can get all transaction by account programatically (using rpc server o rust sdk ) thx, i need help
Cheers, thank for your time! I appreciate it!
yes most likely. and like you figure, based on the authority on mint.
Thank you for the highly detailed response. I'll test the CLI and see if it makes more sense üôÇ I think you cleared it up for me though by explaining that it is the authority that mint tokens. When "Anon" presses mint on a website I now assume that it's just a call to the program that (with or without a fee) mints and returns a token to "Anon"
when a mint is created, a mint authority is specified.  this authority is who 'controls' the mint. this authority can 'mint tokens'.  'minting' tokens and 'creating' tokens are the same thing. anyone can create a 'token account', for that mint. so if you make a 'new token' the bud token, with the spl and do create token, your new token (bud token) has a mint account, and authority, and address. you can then create a token account for a user specifying that mint address (bud token). and now the user specified for the token account now has a 'bud token account'.  there is no 'purchase' of tokens from a mint required, per say. the mint authority, can mint tokens as they see fit, and if that involves charging a fee, or anything else, thats up to the mint authority. an example might be if you deposit 1 sol into this account you receive 1 bud token as a receipt (they didnt pay necessarily, but u minted a token to them as a receipt for their deposit). after a token is minted it is 'in circulation' and the owner of that token can transfer, buy, sell, that token etc. it will show up as a balance in that token account of that mint, for a user. 
I would walk through the token program, and if possible use the CLI to run through the functions and get an idea about how parts of this work:
https://spl.solana.com/token
Hey! I'm wondering about the semantics of minting. If I understand it correctly the following process is correct:
1. Minting authority creates tokens
2. Minting authority mints the tokens
3. Speculator purchases the minting tokens from the minting authority

I may have misunderstood a whole lot, so I appreciate any corrections üôÇ

None of the developer support here supports metaplex. And no one here has the code for these secondary marketplaces because it's not open source
Hey guys. Me and a team are doing an NFT drop on SOLANA. I was wondering about the teams royalties on secondary sales on market places like Solarnart. Is the royalty written into the code on Metaplex with the NFT and then payed automatically back to the creators wallet used for the drop? Also is there any other coding language other than JavaScript that‚Äôs usable on Metaplex? Hope you can help
i solve the error, i just change the version 1.8.1 to 1.8.0

sometimes based on our node or connection you can get delays or slow connectivity as well.  i would try your best to run a local validator so that this type of issue occurs less.

where is the program state saved in? program account or we can store in any account?
In your program, data is written to whatever account you have access in the instruction. So if you deserialize from account A and change it you'll want to write it back out to Account A
so guys, whatever data I'm playing with in rust, is it saved in the same account in which the program exists, or in the accounts derived by PDAs?

this contains a fuller explanation: https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/paper-wallet#public-key-derivation .. my understanding with this is that you can get a compatible private key / seed phrase that you can use
what am I doing transfering funds to another wallet from cli ?

there must be a wallet that is
üòÜ
hmm it seems that they arent compatible, just read somewhere that the use a different derivative path
yea stripped them out already
umm not sure, i guess you'll have to strip out the `[]` from the result? or not sure if you keep them in
Ok I copied but saying incorrect format - maybe its because bip-39 not bip-44?
Windows not supported in all CLI tools (i.e. test validator), you'll need to install and run in WSL/2 under windows.
or just `cat <path to keypair>` to see it in the terminal
then you can do `cat <path to keypair> | pbcopy` to copy your private key to your clipboard
I think `solana config get` again and look at the `Keypair Path`
umm let me check

maybe I can try private key - how do i find that from CLI?
I do, but I would rather dev on my windows.
so i did it on a machine downloading phantom for the first time.
do you have a mac? lol
sigh
importing the private key of your wallet should work? or thats what generated the random wallet?
yep
sounds reasonable, sorry dont know much about windows
In the menu on the top left, you should get options like these
I'll try downloading these dll files manually
I have
It also didnt work - it uploaded a blank wallet. It didnt give me options like sollet just uploaded a random empty wallet
just to confirm you followed these steps: https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools#windows

I tried updating, now I am getting these errors
hmm could you try a different wallet? possibly phantom?
the same happened on Devnet in a different wallet too but tried mainet to see if it resolved
i know very frustrating üòÜ
hmm considering that you've correctly entered the seed phrase in the sollet ui, you should see those tokens
solana .05
cool, what tokens did you send to the wallet. what does `solana balance` return?
You should get `solana-test-validator` after following these instructions: https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools
mainnet beta backup it says in the top right
Ok, so just double check that on sollet, your connected to mainnet
https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
I am following this tutorial : https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-solana-development-with-react-anchor-rust-and-phantom-3291

and I am trying to run this command : solana-test-validator 

However it says that isn't a recognized command. Did I miss something on setting up my Solana environment?
what is it?
OK I see that
Rpc url
OK I ran it what am i looking for
mainnet is 1 of 4 networks
In the terminal, run `solana config get` this will show you what network the solana cli is connected to. So when you create your wallet, it will create the wallet on that network. Which has to match the network that sollet is connected to
As in main net?
Are you on the same network?
guys I really need some help I asked a couple of times before but got no response. I created a wallet on CLI and sent Sol there. I go to retrive wallet on sollet and the seed phrase doesnt bring the wallet up. It shows lots of other empty wallets. Thanks!

Vanilla use of borsh  deserialization will fail if the size of the slice you are passing it is less than or greater than the  shape of the slice (bytes) holding your data that was serialized.
Before jumping through hoops, try this: https://docs.rs/solana-program/1.8.0/solana_program/borsh/fn.try_from_slice_unchecked.html
Another option is to record the size of a serialized data ***in*** the data and fetch that first and then use that to get a slice in length equal to the size of the serialized data, here is a gist where that mocks up that approach : https://gist.github.com/FrankC01/b03937c5e8c74753eb552ca1e15ba8f8

I'm in the process of writing a smart contract, and I have a lot figured out, but I'm wondering if there's a way to retrieve the data about which NFT token addresses a user owns if they connect their wallets to a UI and perhaps clicks a 'verify whitelist' button of some sort. In the token program, I see that there's a struct that contains Account data pertaining to a token account and one of the fields is pub mint which is a publickey of the address that created it (like a candy machine mint address for instance). This is perfect because once I have the mint IDs, I can match them to a CM mint address that I'll allow the user to enter in. But I'd need a way to retrieve the data from a user's public key associated with their account. I'm building a whitelist
or if can find it and see whats being referred to. üôÇ
Thank you for the clarity! I guess the statement I heard (think it was from a video from the Solana YouTube) caused some confusion. Will erase that from memory
creating an account is many times followed by some kind of initialization in the same transaction.

in another scenario here is an example of many instructions in a single transaction, including create and initialize:

what are the risks associated with not waiting for a transaction to be finalized? how often are confirmed transactions a part of a soft fork that dies basically? 99.9%?
Hmm ok. Can the program then use that account in the same transaction?
not sure where you heard/read that or in what context. a program can  invoke (CPI) passing instructions like ( system_instruction::create_account ..)  to create accounts right, this is common.
Hey all, seeking some clarification on something. I cant remember where i read/heard that whilst a program is running, it cannot create a new account?

an error like that may mean whatever your trying to serialize/deserialize is failing because of the serial/deserial method not having a way by default to handle the data or process, or there is some conflict with the data or process, of some kind. the above is generally not enough info, and can vary case by case. it basically is letting you know that your approach does not work. as to why you may have to figure out, or find a correct way of doing it.
+ from an account data size stand point, there is a space/size set when you create an account that gets respected.
+ you can store dynamically sized data, with respect to a max size. but the setup is important.
+ a common mistake is writing to a part of data that overruns, conflicts, or is not expected to a mapped or allocated byte, struct or type.
+ '.serialize' is a kind of blanket function that if it does not map the struct 1 for 1 with allocation it will probably blow up.
+ for that you might have to figure out why, or pack/unpack and write/slice/chop/copy data manually to the correct bytes.
What address are you passing to it
`system_instruction::allocate` is not solving the problem
It seems like `solana-test-validator --clone` is broken
With no context? No
I'm doing: `new_config.serialize(&mut config_acc.data.borrow_mut().as_mut())?` where `config_acc` already exists and has some data in it and it's old data is smaller than the `new_config` data

anyone else seeing this?
'double lamports' itself shouldnt be the issue, but you should be able to get min balance for rent for that in any case. would be realated to accounts created for the same underlying wallet address/owner/authority.
ah yeah it looks like I might be doubling up on creating the account twice, maybe assigning double the lamports required for rent - not sure, digging into it now
if you think you may be responsible, you might be creating token accounts with the same mint using the basic create token account function, when you may want to be creating only if they dont exist, and create an associated token account. there could be other things, but this may be a common one? if i understand correctly.
yeah I guess I don't understand where/why I'm creating an ancillary account but thx for the leads
it can be used to clean up 'ancillary' token accounts for the user. . this helps 'clean up' the wallet/user address to the user does not have lots of useless or dormant accounts laying around among other things and could reclaim sol if applicable.

do you have a code example?  id imagine you would not want to be touching or modifying the account in question in later instructions.
ive always had issues with closing an account (clearing lamports and .data) when its not the at the end of the instruction, does anyone know what might cause this? i get errors involving account balances don't match - but all i have to do is move the snippet of code to the bottom of the instruction and then it all works
ok, and what should I do? just remove it?? or is there any method to fix it?
Your observation is equivalent to a cluster being down
Should only happen when you persist the ledger across runs.  It'll correct eventually if you leave it running, but there are guard rails to prevent the value from moving too quickly
Hi! I saw that solana-test-validator Clock account `SysvarC1ock11111111111111111111111111111111` has a lot of delay with the normal system clock. Is it normal? does it happen the same in mainnet/devnet?? How would it be the best way of keep time in the contracts?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

it sounds like maybe you were just generating a keypair, and not actually creating the account
yes until you create that account (by airdropping funds/rent) it won't exist
if the program is the owner they should be able to debit, close, an account, etc.
If a none executable data account is setup and assigned to a private owner program, can the owner program transfer funds out once the data is no longer required?
In other words, Can an owner program transfer funds out of an account that was assigned to it?  If there is a better channel to ask this question please let me know.
well at least you can continue. haha
chicken egg.
Wtf
Ty for your help
haha
Actually I just got it work. I tried airdropping 1 SOL token and then calling solana account <address> and the details show up now
and `solana airdrop 100`
so with the validator running, what happens when you type `solana balance`
yup its on devnet https://explorer.solana.com/address/A3NSDWJbTmnVqPDb98Qs5EHQtvrQ6xRUybJNeajhWi3E?cluster=devnet

Keypair Path : points to my keypair.json file
the network
It points to /Users/username/.config/solana/cli/config.yml. I haven't changed a thing here
whats your `solana config get` pointing to, is it the correct location you intend?
Validator runs fine
so you get an error when trying to run solana-test-validator?   or does the validator run fine itself and startup after initialize?
I tried running solana-test-validator, still says AccountNotFound
I don't know about it being a test development keypair
solana-keygen new --outfile /Desktop/SolanaWallet/my-keypair.json
also, have you spin up a local test validator? and is it running?  and whats your solana config get say?
how did you create this keypair?  and is it just a test development keypair?
how to update solana cli??? lppaelsel
Same output
I tried all three
localhost / testnet / devnet
is this on localnet?  or what network
Yes
are you sure your taking the exact value from solana address output, and using that with solana account <copied valued>   and do not use the <> ?
thanks for the info i have tried that exactly spl-token burn A3NSDWJbTmnVqPDb98Qs5EHQtvrQ6xRUybJNeajhWi3E 1 but i  "Account could not be parsed as token account:" not sure why
I cant do anything rpc problem?
I can't even get to the part of trying to airdrop a token. I'm stuck on this erroraccountnotfound
please help
I cant airdrop sol
Error: RPC request error: cluster version query failed: error sending request for url (https://api.testnet.solana.com/): error trying to connect: dns error: failed to lookup address information: Temporary failure in name resolution
Yes
with cli? you run solana address <key> ?
My keypair path points to my my-keypair.json file just fine
I'm following this guide : https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-solana-development-with-react-anchor-rust-and-phantom-3291

I run the solana address command and it shows me my address. 

Now I copy the address and run solana account ADDRESS command and it says Error:AccountNotFound: pubkey=ADDRESS
Yeah, i was passing too many arguments. Don‚Äôt add the mint address or blockhash or anything, just the token address and amount
whats the context?
So I'm all set up on my mac now and can run test-validator just fine, but I am still getting this AccountNotFound error. What the f am i doing wrong?
yup its on devnet https://explorer.solana.com/address/A3NSDWJbTmnVqPDb98Qs5EHQtvrQ6xRUybJNeajhWi3E?cluster=devnet
Can you link me to the account in question on an explorer?
Right... so there's this thing we have where an SPL Token address can be derived from the token mint and account owner addresses. This is called an Associated Token Account (ATA), is the preferred way to work with SPL Token accounts and the default addressing the CLI uses.  There is a legacy account generation mode where the addresses were just randomly generated, this requires some extra flags on the CLI to work with
sorry im sorta new not sure what that means
Are the tokens in an ATA or AUX account?
im using the CLI spl-token burn from the $ cargo install spl-token-cli. FYI the token is an NFT not sure if that matters
cli
thanks for the competent answers
You're using the CLI?  JSONRPC? CPI?
has anyone used the spl-token burn call ? i can't seem to get it to work. I keep getting "Account could not be parsed as token account:" and ive tied every address i can think of.
It's not deployed.  That's not to say that it can't/won't be, the main issue is with coordinating adoption
But your proposal was never implemented?
Those tokens are lost then.  My suggestion was to prevent future loss by moving to checked addresses rather than do some unsafe thing and allow lost funds to be moved indirectly
did you get that burn to work im not able to still
thanks
quite right

I need some help to extract the metadata from a token using solana module in python
hello guys
thanx a lot )
First, you might want to ask solang related questions in corresponding channel here or here https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/solang
Second, you can look at how contracts are called in `integration/solana`
Third, there will soon be a library for a simplier way of calling solang compiled contracts, you can find it discussed in the channels above
Hi )

Please help me to understand some basics )) 
1. I've written a primitive Solidity contract
`// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

contract Var {
    string a = "SHE LIVES!!!!!";
    
    function get() public view returns(string memory){
        return a;
    }
}`

2. Built it using Solang
3. Deployed it to `RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com ` and got Program Id `Fn8EwtgAUTRYKy1pWqzQP26stdXMjy7qrWT9sVMpbTU5`

Could you please tell me, what I should google for to execute this program?

))
more or less, according to this:
https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools
and for anything where the prebuilt binaries are not supported you can build from source.
lots of use cases covered. windows does have a pretty good WSL now that you can 'remote' into.
so whatever your comfortable doing
Am looking at overview stats., listed on the provided link., 
Market Overview
Price = $2.27
Fully Dilluted Market Cap =   $22,700,000,000.00
Max Total Supply =   10,000,000,000.00
Holders =  5,526
Website =   https://www.oxygen.org/
Social Channels

Am I supposed to store these stats on a daily basis., or is there api to retrive past overview stats too..?
There's no way to discriminate "non-existent" from "new" addresses
So you're say the destination was mis-specified and that the ATA was created with a non-existent owner?
You can see for yourself.  When transferring money to a non-existent address.  The SOL blockchain recognizes that the address does not exist, and as a result of the transfer to a non-existent address, money is not received there.  But as a result of the transaction, a linked token account appears, which displays the transfer amount.
Ah I see. Thanks
Since it indicates a non-existent address during the transfer, the money did not arrive at this address.  When scanning a transaction on the account of a non-existent address, zero.  When the transaction is scanned, the money is in the associated token account.  I do not understand why this is happening, so I ask for your professional help.
What I'm saying is that the people who know about NFTs on Solana are all there, not here
Thanks. But in Metaplex, I could make an NFT and set the price one by one. Anyway, I will try it.
You need the Metaplex discord
So any Debian should work right
Hey @here, I'm posting this again. I need an NFT program and a simple dApp for minting. I have 7200 images to mint. Please DM me if you have experience in it.
I don't understand what "got stuck in the associated token account means"
Bet , I‚Äôm like tf is going on brehhhh . I‚Äôll use a Linux build
If the transfer left the crypto exchange and got stuck in the associared token account.  Can a crypto exchange help you with a refund?  Or the transfer is irreversible, neither by the exchange nor by the blockchain developers.  Is the translation permanently stuck in the associated token account?
What stats specifically are you interested in? You can get them all using the JSON RPC API https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api mixed with some coingecko api
at least use WSL,  ubuntu distro, otherwise linux/mac ubuntu basic distro will work.
Or a Mac OS
Should I use Linux instead and does it matter which build ?

The PR I linked to is in reference to protecting against _mistyping_ an address by adding a checksum.
I still don't understand what you're really trying to solve
No. Native transfers are not reversible.  Same for basic SPL Token transfers.  This stuff can be built in escrow-style contracts, etc. But will never be base features
Hi, 
I am working on a use case providing overview trends .,, over a period of time.

Thanks in advance üòÄ
what is the issue or errors?
As far as I understand, there is currently no way to reverse transactions on the Sol blockchain.  After reading the topic on github, to which you dropped the link, I do not understand some of the points that I wrote about above.
Please start from the beginning
Are you talking about something other than address checksums?  Assuming you're talking about the issue you linked to in <#885976714646290473>, but that has nothing to do with what you're talking about
because there's other ways to create token that follow ERC721 but NFT from SLP seems to be widely adopted by client wallet
I have one question on the normalized concepts in SOLANA: in NFT case, is the NFT minted by SLP considered as standard NFT?
<@585868308419444749> You were the one who contributed to the discussion on this issue on github.  If the transfer was made from the exchange(USDC, Sol) to a non-existent address (one symbol is not specified).  The money is now in the associated token account.  Nothing can be done now?  Or can the crypto exchange programmatically reverse this transfer?  If so, how exactly can this be done?  If not, are you going as developers to add such a feature in the future?  I really hope for your professional help.
Thank you. I already installed solana on M1 and complete basic operations successfully. But I have some errors running other examples. Do you recommend me to uninstall and install using this method again? Thanks
you can build from source.  https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/884991630984224789
Thank you bro! I'm really happy that I'm working on solana blockchain there is a lot to learn in itüòÑ
Is the solana program compatible with Apple M1 MacOS now?
there are two different ways you can do it.
1. log value in your program. you can use get transaction rpc to retrieve value.
2. write value into account. you can use get account info to retrieve value.
yeah I have read it, I'll see how far I can go from there
Also is it possible to get a value back from my contract in web3?
if you want to implement a contract wallet in solana, you can take a look at this for cross program invocation https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs
Hi everyone, I'm trying to implement a smart contract wallet using Solana, I need smth similar to StaticCall to forward my transactions from the smart contract wallet.
Is that even possible with Solana, or should I use a totally different approach?
thanks
you can use
```
curl http://localhost:8899 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1, "method":"getHealth"}
'
```
this rpc can check node's status
you can use both of them to develop your program. you can take a look at name-service
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/name-service/program/Cargo.toml#L19-L28
Is this solana-test-validator running correctly
Thank you! But then what's the difference between solana program crate and the solana  sdk. Can the solana sdk be used in place of solana program for smart contract development? If the question is making senseüòÖ
any help would be appreciated!

Set up the react-ui-starter again and still having this issue
Thank you will try.
payer can be different with your token account owner.
just remember both of them should sign tx.
sure. you can use program test to test your program. https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/master/src/program-rust/tests/lib.rs
also there is rust sdk you can use
Hi <@!788215642070581289> not sure is that possible? Payer will be a different account owner will be a different account
maybe you can take a look at https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/README.en.md
thanks for doing that, I'll try the example again

Hi All, I am looking a javascript example to transfer custom token from one account to another. Payer account will be different than the custom token owner account.

Hey everybody! Can i run a solana program for testing without having to interact with it with web3? Like just use rust for everything while developing
hey all, building an application using the solana web adapter library with react js. I've tested it with a few wallets (phantom, solflare, sollet, etc.) which all seem to connect properly except for sollet which says "connecting..." but never does. the sollet extension works fine, but sollet by itself does not. has anyone else experienced this?
Like hybrid masternode/regular staking/mining....whoever built it is a beast
It's actually really REALLY nice architecture from what I am reading
There's a lot of documentation on how Solana works here https://docs.solana.com/introduction It's not quite like a masternode no
Recommended to use `getMultipleAccounts` though if passing a large amount of accounts https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getmultipleaccounts
When you use `getAccountInfo` on the account, you can verify the account is a token account by checking the `owner` field is `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`, or the token program address
I can offer financial compensation
Looking for someone to help me reverse engineer a solana program/figure out what instruction data I need to send to it
There isn't a way to do this today. Still the normal `getRecertBlockhash`
How exactly does Solana work? I see something about staking to a validator? Is this like a masternode or something?
you can build solana from source, but change one line in programs/bpf_loader/Cargo.toml - see https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/20783
How I can get metadata for a token while processing transactions on backend, how to make sure the publicAddress is for a token ??
is the only way to subscribe to slots updates and later do an http to get the recent blockhash?

is there any ws json-rpc to fetch the recent blockhash? or is this still in the pipeline?
details from https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/20946
yes, but this error occur: error: failed to run custom build command for `reed-solomon-erasure v4.0.2` v 1.8.1 is work, well.üòÜ

Hey guys,
How can I get what is the price of the transaction inside the smart contract?
When you close an account, any remaining SOL are transferred to another account. If an account is closed and you try to create again, it will have a new state. If the rent balance is zero, it will auto close at the end of an epoch.

<@!878905644353204244>you run solang from a container so it can't see your filesystem
Is it enough to simply close them?
Docs say that
>  Any account that drops to zero lamports is purged.
But I'm not sure what _purged_ means exactly
It is just that I use accounts as proofs (a user-space owner of such account can give it to a program once to receive some rewards), and I wonder what I should do to make sure they can't be reused anymore
If I set their balance to zero are they closed after each instruction? Transaction? Or maybe epoch?
In that what if I were to transfer to a closed account some lamports, will it data still be usable?
Good day! Can somebody, please, explain, what happens when accounts are closed? And when they are closed

Hey y'all is there a way to dynamically create tokens, an example would be you can verify your twitter name and that would create a token that can be traded/monetized on.

I think you don't install dependency correctly, you can take a look at https://github.com/solana-labs/solana#1-install-rustc-cargo-and-rustfmt
for old school ways you can take look https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/instruction.rs#L422
or I recommend you use borsh

I had the same issue when my account was invalid
ah
thats not much to go on, but it could mean the instruction may accept data/params and the data/params being sent is not correct or valid data/params.  knowing which part of program execution (is it when the program is executing an instruction sent and is already running?)  what kind of instruction, what does it look like. the calls. with some relevant code from links, pastebins, or elsewhere etc.
getting it from my program execution and i can't figure out why
does anyone know what `invalid account data for instruction` means
Oh, I meant how can I read a balance of a certain token...  I will edit my question so that it would be more accurate
You should be able to by doing something like this:

```rust
let account = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;
msg!("{}", account.lamports.borrow());
```

an account has a `lamports` property
one thing that also solves it for me is to call ./solana-test-validator.sh from within the solana-1.7.2 folder when you download the source
ah, yeah it's a classic. there is a guide on medium on how to properly install solana. you will need to install solana from source

Hey is there an easy way to give yourself an NFT in your wallet using the solana console? or any other method
yes just follow instructions here:  and submit a PR.
I just create the .md file, are we need to wait for some time to create PR for the image?
Yeah was this thing only. Thanks now facing another issue. Looking into that. Thanks.
e.g.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountbalance
how to pass slot number as a param to get historical data?
the slot number is the first param
You can use `getBlock` https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getblock
Hi
I want to know the way to get historical data at given slot.
how can I pass slot number with json rpc api?
create a PR
Hi guys, I want to list add my project into solana's github ecosystem repo. Anyone knows how to do it?
I already create the file.md and the image. What's next? Because I can't add file in the master branch.

I'm not sure it's a correct place to ask this, if you have any solution would be appreciate üôÇ
Takes up a lot of space tho ..
Thank u
Damn cargo is fucking clutch
it is 'the'  package manager for rust,  lots of good info here:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/
What is cargo build & cargo test
using the communication here is best. there are no unimportant questions as long as they are relevant to the channel. there are only questions that you may not ask that can not be answered.
generally means there is some data / buffer expected length mismatch or overflow.   so when your deserializing/serializing, the object your using to do this to/from, has to have less than or equal to the space allocated being passed.  If the buffer is greater than what is expected on either end, it can throw a type of overflow, mismatch, or not deserialize correctly.   I would just check the struct your serializing, make sure the types and allocation are correct, going, and coming back. Print out the before and after data, even before and after serializing before send, as necessary, as it could be a simple data type or size mismatch.
Pmed u
It works now Sers
This is in TS
it works.  i just tried it, you copy and paste it correctly?
Sers the link is broke

Not working
I assume that any data lost is gone for good right? If I had a token and nobody tops up it's storage, suddenly people's tokens would disappear with garbage collection
Is this in your Program? OR: TS/JS or Rust Cli?
Does anyone else get a 404 when trying to instal 1.8.1 from the Docs using Curl
I'm trying to follow the tutorial here: https://docs.solana.com/offline-signing. So I may be doing something wrong ü§î . I was able to sign and submit through the cli but not get this raw transactino and submit via rpc
tried but the issue wasn't fixed!!
sure, but unfortunately same result
 ```spl-token gc -u https://api.devnet.solana.com --owner /home/sack/solana/keypair.json

nvm, running on --release did the trick
Just as a sanity check, could you try using the full path?

I can send account address, if it will help
My account have filed 'Assigned program id', and now I can not do any transaction
When you say assigned a program, what do you mean? If you mean you trusted a program, you can go under settings->trusted apps->revoke
Hi everyone, I accidentally assigned a program to my phantom wallet address, how can I fix it?
This usually happens what you serialize the wrong format. How are you constructing the transaction?
oww thanks sir lemme take a look
Here's an example of how to get metadata of all NFTs under a publickey https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/get-account-nfts/getAccountNFTs.ts
here is the example nft https://explorer.solana.com/address/Gdjy9FERKvSGHescoMQFCANueCPeWEm3BJ5bfQDVKUnF
yepp
In regards to metadata, are you asking about NFT metadata?
<@!489206164270350337> do u have any information about this sir ?
Hello developers! Does anyone know why the rust client is slower than the js one??

doing `get_program_account_with_config()` takes 4x time on Rust using the same filters üò¶
This will walk you through all of the information needed about the token program https://spl.solana.com/token
Source for the token program is found here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/program
I'm aware of sdk and solana cli but I need to know about the rust smart contracts
Hi everybody, does anybody know what this error means when sending a transaction through RPC?
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32602,"message":"io error: failed to fill whole buffer"},"id":1}
```
yeah,  it's in the location specified and even has some open and empty accounts related to it
Are you sure that you have a keypair generated already?
trying to understand the gc command now. shouldn't this be working?
```spl-token gc -u https://api.devnet.solana.com --owner ~/solana/keypair.json
error: No such file or directory (os error 2)```
absolutely. But first let me further investigate what the real issue is / how to solve it
sounds like it could be a project then üòâ
Here's a walkthrough of creating a token on Solana https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/sol-mint-token
Hi Team,
I'm exploring the smart contract in solana and I need few examples regarding the SPL Tokens or NFT tokens using rust
It's somehow fascinating. It feels like everyone would be in the situation sooner or later, but i cannot find a sample implementation for it.
ah, if you have no other accounts with a balance, then you'll be safe
I have no transfer instruction. I just want to clean up since i racked up a huge number of empty accounts where i am paying rent for <:blob_sweat:792417931425218580>
Hey guys, I am facing an error while deserializing using borsh: I am getting `originalMessage: "Expected buffer length 1952408161 isn't within bounds"` Does anyone know about this issue or have you faced this issue before?
If you created them for someone else, they own the account, so unless you have the close authority on the account, you won't be able to
the `transfer` commands for accounts where `amount > 0` would fail the close instruction later, so watch out for those too: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/756696ee8e7b8dbe640113079ba11447ba3524c1/token/cli/src/main.rs#L1312 or maybe it would just fail, and that's fine, not sure off the top of my head
Would this also close all accounts that i created on anothers behalf which are now empty?
ah, so you say i should remove the `if address == associated_token_account ` check? The balance is already checked as far as i understand the code. so `spl-token gc` would close up all empty accounts for the wallet that is used to call the command?
It's still an account, there's just no data or SOL in it
yep, usually, there aren't too many good use-cases for data disappearing
You'll probably just want to hack the CLI to not do this check during gc and only do it for accounts where `amount == 0`: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/756696ee8e7b8dbe640113079ba11447ba3524c1/token/cli/src/main.rs#L1298 -- that way, all accounts will get GC'ed, and those with `amount > 0` will be untouched
what happens if a programs tries to call an account that doesn't have any sol?
so devs just top up all storage accounts which 2 years of rent?
yeah, i was already there. But the `Closing accounts` section is not sufficient to help me understanding.
Like which parameters would we need to use in the RPC Call?
(And isn't it implemented in one of the libraries?)
There's a concept of "rent-exemption" if a storage account has at least 2 years of rent in it: https://spl.solana.com/token#rent-exemption
guys how can i get the metadata address of related token account ?
For solana accounts that are used as storage for programs, do developers need to monitor their sol balance so that they aren't garbage collected?
take a look at `spl-token gc`: https://spl.solana.com/token#garbage-collecting-ancillary-token-accounts -- you'd have to add some logic to call `close_account` on any empty account
how can we close all empty token accounts which are related to one wallet? I know that it can be done manually through solflare, but for sure there is a way to create a script or something like that which does it for all empty accounts?
You've understood 100%, and the only other difference with `create_account` is that it'll assign the account to your program, which means that your program could deduct lamports from the PDA without calling `system_instruction::transfer`
ok, so I don't call `SystemInstruction::CreateAccount` with the pda in the client, I just generate the pda, pass the pda in the message, which will then become a 0 lamports, 0 data account accesible to the program, then I can create an account inside the program. Do I bother calling `SystemInstruction::CreateAccount` if I don't care about the data and I can give the pda account enough lamports to be rent exempt?
thanks for your info so far btw. tremendous help!
thank youüôè
it looks like the solana mainnet node doesn't allow you to issue this request because the returned payload would be too large
change https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com to https://solana-api.projectserum.com
what is disabled? what was your resolution for this?
That's pretty much it, one thing to note is that you can't "create" the account without a signature, so the step to "create the account" will have to happen on-chain, within your program, as an `invoke_signed` call to the system program, same as the associated token program does it
I'm sorry, I keep forgetting to actually use reply
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/902553518420942910
if you mean staking pool then there is an example in the solana-program-library
For example the program raydium or orca are using?
I was to create a stacking pool, is there anything open source yet on Solana?
ok, in conclusion: to have access to an account_info struct for the pda so I can invoke things in which the pda is used as an account and not just a pubkey, I need the client the generate the pda, create the account, pass the account + seed & bumpseed and then I can do invoke_signed without problem
ah yeah, the output seed from `find_program_address` I call bump seed here
The hope is that frameworks like Anchor will abstract a lot of this complication away!
The term "seed" is a bit overloaded in this case... I was referring specifically to the seed that's output from `find_program_address`. you will need to have all of the input seeds on the client and the program either way, yes.
I sure hope developing on Solana becomes more straight forward in the future because tbh it has a pretty steep learning curve right now
wait, you lost me again. unless, the program provides the seed (similar to providing it's own id) how can the program know what seed was used to call `find_program_address`?
Exactly.  You can also by convention use the seed from `find_program_address`, so the client doesn't also need to pass in the seed
so the client generates the pda, passes the pda to the program (so it's accessible as an `account_info` struct) and the client also passes the seed if the program need to do `invoke_signed` later on since the pda was generated in the client and not the program?
Your client has to generate the pda and pass it in
I'm probably missing something obvious here and then it will click
but then how does my client know what the pda is?
or generating the pda and using it needs to happen in separate instructions then
I'm talking about cpi and I understand that I can require the pda to be passed into an instruction but that still leaves me clueless on how to pass it in the first place when I'm running inside a program and I generated the pda
I'm sorry if I'm repeating myself but if I'm processing an instruction and I generate a pda + bump seed, I can't have the pda being passed right? and when I want to invoke an instruction that has the pda passed into it, I still need the account_info struct of the pda to pass in the first place right? unless I invoke it from a client but that's not what I'm doing here
that's why you have to pass the pda into the top-level instruction, so that you have the `account_info` for it, same as the associated token program does
Hm, you may need to try reinstalling web3, something might have gotten mucked up
but if I were to invoke `AssociatedTokenAccountInstruction::Create`, how can I pass the pda into the program? I don't have an `account_info` struct to pass to invoke right? won't it fail?
thanks!
You need to pass the PDA into the instruction if you want to do `create_account` on it, the associated token program has a nice example of this: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/756696ee8e7b8dbe640113079ba11447ba3524c1/associated-token-account/program/src/processor.rs#L47
The associated token account (PDA) doesn't exist, but it's still possible to pass into a program
is it possible to invoke create_account from a program? you need to supply the account_info struct of the new account but I obviously don't have that yet
looks like the `publicKey` isn't actually a `PublicKey` type
`solana-rpc` is the actual node's rpc server implementation, while `solana-client` contains all of the clients (rpc, pubsub, tpu, etc).  For the RPC spec, you'll want to look into `rpc_client.rs` in `solana-client`
Solved it already, thanks anyways man, appreciate it‚ò∫Ô∏è
Hi there, you can use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountsbyowner to get all token holdings for a wallet / owner
Hai, Im getting following error when tried to use @ solona/web3.js . While trying to resolve module `superstruct` from file `/Users/Documents/App/node_modules/@solana/web3.js/lib/index.browser.esm.js`, the package `/Users/Documents/App/node_modules/superstruct/package.json` was successfully found. However, this package itself specifies a `main` module field that could not be resolved (`/Users/Documents/App/node_modules/superstruct/lib/index.cjs`. Indeed, none of these files exist:   can anyone help ? this is react-native project
because I need an account but I can't invoke create_account as I don't have an account_info struct for the pda. or I'm missing something
hello, is it possible to receive and send sol with a pda?
How are you setting the publicKey? If you have the public key as a string e.g. `"9xQeW..."` you'll have to instantiate a publicKey type from it with ..

```js
import {
  PublicKey,
} from '@solana/web3.js';

 const publicKey = new PublicKey("9xQeW...")

```
Globally installed anchor version is not correct. Expected "anchor-cli 0.17.0", found "anchor-cli 0.18.0".

anybody got this problem?
I always get this error when trying to get the balance of a wallet with getAccountInfo
```

Hi there, I am playing around with the rust sdk and I would love to know the difference between `solana-rpc` and `solana-client`, the client does not seem to have implemented some of the methods like `program_subscribe` inside the `PubsubClient` struct, it only has `logs_subscribe`, `slot_subscribe`, and `signature_subscribe`. What about  the rest specified in the JSON-rpc specification??
Alright, turns out it's dsiabled on the mainnet-beta endpiont, serum worked -- in case anyone is facing the same error
Does anyone have experience building bots auto sending transaction with a nft marketplace? May I know is it possible to do so?
Bump. I'm getting the exact same error, does anyone know what's going on? this code worked yesterday

I solved luckily
Hi guys, How can I get token holdings of an account using JSON RPC API?

Hi guys. I am on Ubuntu 20 and got SSL error when building solana hello world example
Hi Team. Just wondering can a PDA own the Sol Wallet... Like I know it can own a Account and token account but can it actually have authority on Sol account?
Those gPA filters should map onto secondary indexes before getting to it though, which is the behavioral change
No. That's always been there
i know nothing about the rpc runtime/core but from the looks of the error message it seems like there was an update to the rpc runtime that intentionally excludes the token program from gPA? Possibly due to performance concerns?
Sorry I thought we had a `getTokenAccountsByMint`, but looks like that needs to be done via gPA
I suspect this broke it.  Not obvious to me how ATM. https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/commit/1d7f6a2c66d6ada83d1e628463f14f36dc7f80be
I'm not sure this is appropriate, but I'm looking for the guy whose address starts with `Ai5Zrh...`. Give me an DM and maybe we can cooporate to conquer sir.
I used to just do `getProgramAccounts` with the memcmp filter
sorry, could you be a bit more specific? Which calls will you suggest using to get a list of all token owners for a particular mint?
Yeah. A few https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api
hello im running into the same issue right now. However I can't use `getTokenAccountsByOwner`  because I want to discover what owners there are for a particular token. Is there an alternative to this rpc call? `getTokenLargestAccounts` isnt enough
Hi there, may I know is there any method to stream transactions from a smart contract? Sth like a web socket but the current providing websockets does not have a transactions stream. Thanks in advance
Thanks!
You can just copy a snapshot off of your validator and `solana-ledger-tool accounts --help` it
Is there any available snapshot I can download to parse all account data in json or other format at the specific slot?
Yeah it should be mapped onto the same secondary index internally.  A more awake me will look into it in the morning
It worked, Thank you. Still don't know why the old one stopped working. But it's fine for now I think.
never mind it worked....
['whitelist',{kind:'option',type:[WhiteList]}],

did this while copying the format from metaplex but the end result of serialization is an empty buffer array..... is there anything wrong with this ? or what's going on here if anyone can help!!! trying to serialize it using borsh
I had asked if you were looking for a specific account and you said yes but apparently the answer was no
or like how many min has passed since slot
are there any good resources for converting slot to unix time?
It that alright to subscribe all stake account? Should I worry about the performance?
I want to monitor all stake account and cache the change in local database for query, but only received initialized / delegate / undelegate event, no withdraw event.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#accountsubscribe
You should be able to use account subscribe
Yes
Any info for this? I read the official docs but it doesn't mention.
Are you looking to see if stake was removed to a specific account?
Hi, Is there any way to subscribe withdraw event on stake program? I tried `Connection.onProgramAccountChange` but no withdraw event received.
Should be the same thing
I will try that one if that has the result, Thanks.
Why not call `getTokenAccountsByOwner` ?

probably more of rust because I don't plan on using it on a UI but ill take both if possible
Pretty sure not all of those accounts need to be loaded writable
web3 preferably but I can try out rust
using what? rust, web3?
Do you have a recommendation for the smaller size? Should I just start halving it until it (un)breaks?
Sorry if this is a dumb question but can anyone point me in the right direction of learning to create signed transactions using private key or something efficient in anyway not sure how to get signatures atm
Ok ill try there
did u try raydium discord?
try a smaller data size?

Hi guys, how to read my account activities, any api for that?
confirms generally do not return much.  if i recall, generally null if ok and err otherwise. anymore is extra.  this looks like anchor so might be some extra.
I could use help on this as well. Very curious and it just started happening today!
Try changing your commitment to confirmed
If I understand you correctly, it's up to the invoking program to check that the program ID provided matches what it expects before calling it
so its supposed to only return this?
```
{ err: null, slot: 89885244, confirmations: 0 }
```
yes
for txid here do i just use the transaction id string?
```js
export const awaitTransactionSignatureConfirmation = async (
  txid: anchor.web3.TransactionSignature,
  timeout: number,
  connection: anchor.web3.Connection,
  commitment: anchor.web3.Commitment = "recent",
  queryStatus = false
)
```
and the caller will call the wrong program
(caller)
because I can just pass an incorrect program ID client side to the intermediary
what stops me from injecting my own code in the middle of this?
quick question about cross-invocation
ah thanks
Because it's deprecated.  I think `processed` is the equivalent
I am getting the same error that 0xTracker reported: error: ```{code: -32010,‚Ä¶}
code: -32010
message: "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA excluded from account secondary indexes; this RPC method unavailable for key"```
this error seems to be intermitent--any idea why? And should I be using a different data size? Am using 165 as in the exampeld shared: ```private static buildParsedAccountsRequest(walletPublicKey: PublicKey): GetParsedProgramAccountsConfig {
        return {filters: [{dataSize: 165}, {memcmp: {offset: 32, bytes: walletPublicKey.toString()}}]};

Hi guys. I am trying to learn how to place my project info in the Solana ecosystem page. If I have the files in my own project folders with 1 files each in sub folder projects & img, how can I actually place this into solana repo? Thanks alot
But it seems solana by default uses a uuid when used lively in the field
Yea agreed
> An identifier established by the Client that MUST contain a String, Number, or NULL value if included.

Seems like it can be anything, it's just returned opaquely
Just a uuid v1 or v4
All good üôÇ

unless there was an update that i'm not aware of, the program is immutable.
i think this is the important line 

**Once executable, the runtime enforces that the account's data (the program) is immutable.**
üò¶
unlucky for me
yeah I scanned over that, but `solana program close` made me think there was more to it that I was missing
```If an account is marked "executable" in its metadata, then it is considered a program which can be executed by including the account's public key in an instruction's program id. Accounts are marked as executable during a successful program deployment process by the loader that owns the account. When a program is deployed to the execution engine (BPF deployment), the loader determines that the bytecode in the account's data is valid. If so, the loader permanently marks the program account as executable. Once executable, the runtime enforces that the account's data (the program) is immutable.```
did you figure it out?
there isn't. there are limits because it was being abused and people were draining the wallet
my gut instincts tell me no and I'm scanning the docs rn
once a program is deployed, can it be 'trashed' so to speak? aka become a regular writable account again

Hello, I have an issue with 
`Transaction simulation failed: Transaction loads a writable account that cannot be written`
Im trying to use Raydium swap function
I red from the announcement section `please check if the invoked program executable accounts in your transaction are read-only or writable`

So my questions are:
* how to check if my WSOL account is writable
* how to create writable WSOL account (shared creating account code under to see if Im creating not writable account)
* if thats correct why im still getting this error? Any ideas?
* is it possible that the WSOL account is in general incorrect. But when i check created account in solscan it seems correct

```javascript
{
    create: async (connection, owner, programId = 'TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA') => {
      const account = new web3.Account()
      const newAccountPubkey = account.publicKey
      const space = ACCOUNT_LAYOUT.span
      const lamports = await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(space)

      const instruction = web3.SystemProgram.createAccount({
        newAccountPubkey, space,
        fromPubkey: owner,
        programId: new web3.PublicKey(programId),
        lamports
      })

      return [instruction, account, newAccountPubkey]
    },

Hey, lets assume I have 3 Wallets in phantom which are all binded to the same recovery phrase, what do I have to do to use wallet 2 or 3 in the command line?
`solana-keygen recover 'prompt: key=0/0' -o phantom-wallet.json` works  for restoring the first wallet but idk how to get the other wallets
its ebpf
this is using the serum sol-wallet-adapter
has anyone had trouble integrating with sollet.io because of cross-origin errors? im not sure what the workaround here is, or even if should need one... im just calling `signTransaction` and it throws `Blocked a frame with origin "https://fortuna:8080" from accessing a cross-origin frame.`
also is it BPF or eBPF
can i rely on clock drift during epoch to generate some entropy?
is anyone actually executing the BPF compiled contracts? like say, validators?
Wow thank you so much <@!785084693023424542> üôÇ
what does your StakePoolInstruction look like in rust?  does it match the incoming buffer you serialized, and is the instruction receiving ::DepositSol(  taking the correct value, type, size) and instruction number. it can, be many things. in a case like this though, it may mean the way your sending the data to the program is incorrect. its also worth logging with msg! to see at what point you may be getting, and running with any debug/trace - true to get verbose debug logging/messaging. same with the validator. to help troubleshoot.
the original escrow tutorial uses amount. and may be a good reference as a resource here:
https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/#cpis-part-1
I see, so maybe I am passing in wrong accounts to keys?
This error may be misleading. I‚Äôve ran into this on several occasions. I‚Äôve got this error when I‚Äôve tried to borrow a mutable reference to the account data but I don‚Äôt have ownership of the account
This is the Rust Code ->
This is how I am constructing the data buffer
Does this mean the data I am passing part of the transaction is formatted wrong?

hey I've been meaning to raise a github issue for this for a while but writing some notes down here just in case I keep getting delayed:

there's some weird issue with the 1.7.x Docker images (including 1.7.16) where `createMint` fails with `{'InstructionError': [1, 'InvalidAccountData']}`. 
Also this appears in the log messages: `ELF error: Failed to parse ELF file: malformed: Too small`

This is just on the Docker images, it works fine with `solana-test-validator`. Python code is here https://github.com/michaelhly/solana-py/blob/master/tests/integration/test_token_client.py#L23
I have been able to reproduce in JS but trying to find the script I wrote üòÖ

cool thanks <@!248579599066333187>  - aware of the irreversible hash function, just wasn't sure if there might be something special with the way ATA works that might make possible. sounds like it's still a no.
afaik no, the pdas are derived with an irreversible hash function
A noob question  hope someone might be able help - Given an Associated Token Address (which was derived from owner key and mint), is a reverse lookup possible to find out what the associated mint was without having to fetch the token account data on chain?

not public. you can purchase your own
There is an other rpc public/free with all historical data ?
this is a public rate limited rpc
mainnet public beta rpc has nothing to do with the chain
you can always use a RPC service so you don't have to worry about this and have it all to yourself
for huge traffic
solana is not prepared *yet*
Ok :/
The law of induced demand always wins
this is why we can't have nice (free) things
Not down.  Managing unexpected load though
let me confirm
for example this one : 
```curl https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"getBlock","params":[40000101],"id":4}```
All my request (same as usual) timeout.
It seems down
if you're trying to do NFT stuff like candy machine on mainnet beta public RPC you are likely blocked though
no
Is mainnet rpc down?
Here's an example on retrieving NFTs under an account. Along with the output is the Arweave metadata, which has the image urls https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/get-account-nfts/getAccountNFTs.ts
how can i retrieve the arweave image url? what data and which method do i need for that?
Awesome thx,  think my best bet is to use unix time
The expected time per slot is ~400ms, but it does vary. You can do the math, or look back on previous slots/minute to get a better idea
all the info you do require, needs to be passed in.  if there is an account, it needs to be passed in.
https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/#cpis-part-1
I can't find examples which call CPI from program directly, AccountInfo is created in JS client and passed to program.
I'm going to call CPI from program. The problem is how to create AccountInfo from programId(program public key).
is there an estimate of how many slots pass in a min?
This script gets all the NFTs of a public key and prints the NFT metadata. Part of it you will find the update authority
https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/get-account-nfts/getAccountNFTs.ts
(in my situation)
So all the addresses whose share the same update authority = same collection
The public key will be used only once for a collection
But in my use-case, it won't
https://discord.gg/metaplex
I would reach out on the Metaplex discord. There's very specific steps to determine a NFT is from a specific collection
What if a public key is used on multiple NFT collections? Update authority would be the same, but not the collection
via checking if the update authority is the same, i can therefore say, they're from the same collection
different mint authority, and mint address
All the NFTs of the collection has the same update authority
NFT
Are you asking about the update authority of a program? Or NFT?
hello all. Quick check on cross-program invocation, how do the account models guarantee the correct program is being invoked in an application?
that brings me the mint authority / freeze authority, but not the current update authority of the mint
You'll have to decode the data coming from `getAccountInfo` for a mint. You can reference js implementation in `getMintInfo` https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L725
were you doing this on and NFT or on devnet by chance?
that is the mint address https://explorer.solana.com/address/A3NSDWJbTmnVqPDb98Qs5EHQtvrQ6xRUybJNeajhWi3E?cluster=devnet
Thaaaanks this is perfect ‚ù§Ô∏è
how can i check the update authority of a mint via json rpc?
use the getParsed variant: getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner ?
I think you have to use the address for the mint
It's automatically added by `@solana/web3.js`
its more of a borsh and serialization issue right.  so your trying to do this with an 'array/vect  of a type?
<@!785084693023424542> this is what we're trying todo
Try using the encoding `jsonParsed`
long story short the proposed solution did not work for us
Hello, I'm trying to retrieve mint address for each token holded by a specific account.
When I'm using `getTokenAccountsByOwner` using `@solana/web3.js` module, I received the response array with tokens but the data in account is an encoded Uint8Array that I'm trying to decode without success for now, someone know how can I do ? Thanks

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

but it's still possible to create a >10kb account if it's *not* an inner instruction right?
Not right now üòî
afaik. programs are stateless. so they need to be called to be interacted with. to act on data, they need to receive it. they can only do and interact with what they are given, based on the makeup of the program itself. 'stateless'. so you would send instructions to the program through transactions for processing. i do not believe there are any other type of internal program events currently that you can catch or subscribe to, that would allow you to process or run logic in the program.
can a program not interact with itself? From what I understand, you can credit a program account and it can make decisions on what happens to the lamports it received, right?
thanks Vesper! 

Is there no viable bridge from ETH or other popular chains to SOL at the moment? I am reading about wormhole protocol but not seeing any super viable/popular services with it implemented and working live atm but maybe i'm missing something?
thanks Lisen ‚ù§Ô∏è
just tell them to use Binance or Kucoin, deposit their ETH/BSC tokens, and buy sol then withdrew on Solana network.. no need for an article, a single sentence would cover it
anchor atm, is the Solana framework that is paving the pathway for tools and setup. it comes with 'anchor' commands, for test build and deploy, along with other things, and other framework benefits like serialization, and much more:

frameworks for easier deployment of contracts
is there a tool equivalent to something like hardhat in solidity?
yes
the majority of solana coding is done in rust?
the only way to interact with a program is through some kind of client. so when interacting with a contract it usually talks about and may implement a client side.
https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/

it continues running. its like your own mini live blockchain. you can stop it, reset it. do what you want with it.
ohhh, I thought it would stop running after it was done lol
if you see confirms the test validator should be working and up an running

Pretty strange <@!788215642070581289> but when I encode the Array with base58, my string isn't a 64 bytes string
Hey guys, just jumping into this space for the first time. Trying to work through the example-helloworld and was wondering how long the solana-test-validator usually takes haha
also is there an open source prediction market implementation on solana? Something like Augur or Gnosis's conditional token framework
bump
That some stuff happens to be deployed at the same addresses is purely because maintainers found it convenient to do so
Zero in  common
No.  They're totally different accounts states and ledgers
I'm still a little confused as to the difference. Testnet and Devnet are identical, and Mainnet Beta just have the addition "backed by a load balancer" (Im not sure what that means)
Can i ask you the call where we can implement and deploy the Program in C? i can pay your time
not sure. but I think the deploy program process is the same https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program
first you build your program then you got the so file
then you deploy it
check https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints
So what was I getting before? What is the difference between the two?
i ask <@!788215642070581289>  if in the soldev.app i can fund the video about the implementation ad deploy of Program in C
change` client = Client("https://api.devnet.solana.com")` to
`client = Client("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com")`
It means your `Client` is targeting the wrong cluster
What does that mean?
You can airdrop yourself some sol on devnet/local/testnet with https://docs.solana.com/cli/transfer-tokens#airdrop-some-tokens-to-get-started
That's mainnet beta
https://solscan.io/tx/61nMB5jS96sUtHAgDaHhjCrdTjyQ9k81ZGPTcqDDHtQYrvQhc1RmwEFKW7XVhgPY39fwN88VQdBbHbALn5NwxkiW
https://explorer.solana.com/address/Aqa61uhXWV5DcznLdv5JbcMYs3Qa1wXzXGUE6RGVUcYA?cluster=devnet

both of them not exist on devnet. so sdk returns you empty
here i can fund the implementation ad deploy of program in C?
All I need is a list of transactions/transaction data related to a given address, so Im not doing anything too crazy
```from solana.rpc.api import Client

client = Client("https://api.devnet.solana.com")
print(client.get_confirmed_signature_for_address2('Aqa61uhXWV5DcznLdv5JbcMYs3Qa1wXzXGUE6RGVUcYA', limit=1))
print(client.get_confirmed_transaction('61nMB5jS96sUtHAgDaHhjCrdTjyQ9k81ZGPTcqDDHtQYrvQhc1RmwEFKW7XVhgPY39fwN88VQdBbHbALn5NwxkiW'))``` Does anything look wrong with that code?
And thanks I'll look into that
Yup, that should work, the API accepts multiple PDA signers
maybe check https://www.soldev.app/ 
or if you don't mind look at js code. you can take a look at https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/README.en.md
mid-slice signer seed, innermost slice seed bytes
not familiar the api but the main idea is that you sign message and you will get signature
when you want to verify, you use pubkey, signature and message.

Uint8Array is the signature, if you want to retrieve a string, you can use base58 encode or xxx encode to do it
Outermost slice entries should be per-signer
Yah I think so, `signers_seeds: &[&[&[u8]]]`
will give it a go
?
`&[new_pda_signer_seeds, funder_seeds]`
haven't tried but I don't even know how I would try.
Are you getting an error when you try?
cc/ <@!453347985628200960> for confirmation
The function signature seems to imply that will work
And so I'd like to sign with new_pda_signer_seeds AND seeds used to generated funder.key
Here the funder.key is also a PDA which has lamports in it to fund creation of new data storing PDAs
<@!585868308419444749> Is it possible to have multiple PDA signers in a CPI? For example, 

```
        solana_program::program::invoke_signed(
            &solana_program::system_instruction::create_account(
                funder.key,
                new_pda_account.key,
                rent.minimum_balance(space).max(1),
                space as u64,
                owner,
            ),
            &[funder.clone(), new_pda_account.clone(), system_program.clone()],
            &[new_pda_signer_seeds],
        )
```
1-3. I believe it will work. 
4. Docs shouldn't be much different(just require vs import). 
5. You can use the mainnet rpc endpoints instead of infura to work

In regards to local file vs reading remote, why not use a bundler and install using the package(like `npm i @solana/web3.js` or `yarn add @solana/web3.js`)?
Thanks Chido, just another question when I sign a message with `solana.signMessage(data, 'utf8')` I got an object with `publicKey` and a `signature`, but the signature is a `Uint8Array` format, how can I retrieve the original signature string ?

I would like to use tweetnacl to verify the signature on server side for example (see https://tweetnacl.js.org/#/sign)
<@!489206164270350337> I prefer to use a dependency file that is on my computer (rather than reading a remote file), so please confirm that the following process will work:
1. Using Chrome, I navigated to <https://unpkg.com/@solana/web3.js@latest/lib/index.iife.min.js>, and used "Save As" to save it to a local file named "index.iife.min.1.30.2.js".
2. If I now add **<script src="index.iife.min.1.30.2.js">** to my javascript program, will I be able to do all the functionality that is described in the Solana documentation?
3. Are any other dependency files required?
4. Are there any features or descriptions in your documentation that are different for the **server-side version** of solana-web3.js (running under Node.js), than the **client-side version** that I have described above?
5. I am very familiar with web3, which requires using Infura to access the Ethereum blockchain. When I include **index.iife.min.1.30.2.js**, will any other component be required to access the Solana blockchain?

Thanks for your help!
I'm trying to figure out how to build a smart contract that executes every time it receives a lamport transaction
is it possible to execute a smart contract without having a client?
Are there any good resources for figuring out how to do that? My first idea was just to do that, but I didn't know anything about rpc and thats why I went with solanapy
is there an amm implementation on solana that allows concentrated liquidity positions like uniswap v3?
Thanks üôÇ
that sounds weird.
maybe check your network or do what you do on pure rpc call for checking what is the real problem
`getSignaturesForAddress` only return txhash. you need to `getTransaction` that can fetch all tx detail include data and log.
Hello üôÇ I'm making a game that requires a blockchain validation for changing weapon for example.
First, do you think making a message signature with data before sending to our server is a good solution ?
Next, how can I retrieve the signed message including the data ? I tried JSON RPC method `getSignaturesForAddress` but I can't retrieve it
Hey I've been struggling with a solanapy issue and was hoping someone could help me. When I search for an address or transaction signature, the result is always empty, even if I have confirmed that the address/signature is right and should have return values. Anyone familiar with it and would be willing to help?
yeah but the documentation about the deploy is not clear...
There's a collection of c examples here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/examples/c as well as docs here https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-c
i want implement Program with Alon: https://lithdew.github.io/alon/ but i don 't  know how can i deploy <@!331688811186618370>
Check out `getSignaturesForAddress` and `getTransaction` https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress
Hi, can you teach me how can i implement program in C? i can pay your time
I expect dappradar and others do that, or at least in an aggregated format. Querying the large amount of transactions via json rpc on the fly may take too long to serve to a user
awesome, enjoy rust! c developers love it üòÑ
Makes sense. I am not a rust but only a c programmer so next step to the pull request now is to understand how to add a flag like this in rust.
Will do that and then create the request. Thank you!
I need to maintain a record of all the transactions on my end(as in maintain it in my DB)..?
You could track transaction data across a specific programId. Take Raydium for example. If you track transactions, you can know the amount of users(accounts making transactions), volume(amount transferred/time) and activity
Can someone please suggest a approach, how I can work on a similar solution
https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/solana
`gc` is about closing ancillary accounts (ie not associated token accounts), and you want to close all empty accounts, whether they're associated token accounts or not.  i think you want to add a flag to specify closing all empty associated accounts, which likely falls in the realm of `gc`, but i can be overruled on that
thanks!
oh wow didnt realise phantom had the optioin to import a private key
can i use the private key in a wallet?
so i need a seedphrase/mnemonic
i wanted to import this wallet to my paper wallet
actually i didnt get it lol
Latest is `1.30.2`. You can auto get latest with `<script src="https://unpkg.com/@solana/web3.js@latest/lib/index.iife.min.js"></script>`
ohhh got it
like the mnemonic
The cli generates the private key in the form of a json file. You can find where the default one is located at `solana config get`
Hi. Looking for a solana smartcontract dev. for project. dapp. not nft. any suggestions where to look for?
Sounds good.
I just don't understand why the gc command is not generally closing those accounts, too? (Thinking about how to change the code for the pull request. Additional command similar to gc which only closes those associated accounts, or just modifying the gc command)
if you just type 'make' at the command line, do you get message that it can't be found? If so, you need to install it. In addition, you need to have C compiler(s) installed on the system. `clang` or `gcc`
haha, it's nonsense, don't worry about that.  unless you want to keep them around for some sort of bookkeeping in the future? i can't really think of a great reason
I'm trying to find a public smart contract that I can deploy that serves as a middleman in a transaction that automatically checks the input of lamports into an account, divides it and sends it to previously specified wallets without needing any manual inputs. Just wondering if anyone is aware of anything like this?
how do i see my seedphrase in cli?
Anyone that can help me?
No, it would break deterministic outcome (i.e. it's a side effect)
can anyone help me. I got a WSL set up trying to follow the HelloWorld lab and im kinda lost. Im trying to build the program-c and im not sure where to go from here..

Hey, guys. any one knows how to get signer_seeds from keypair in rust?
Who in this beautiful land can recommend a good security auditor?
Hi Avalanche have you find any solution to this?
**Where is the latest version of solanaWeb3.min.js?**

I would like to download the latest version of solanaWeb3.min.js, which is the "browser" version of solana-web3.js.

A website that is a year old (<https://morioh.com/p/720daf27c8c8>) gave this address: <https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/releases/download/v0.0.6/solanaWeb3.min.js>

I downloaded the latest **release** here (v1.30.1.zip), but that zip file did not contain solanaWeb3.min.js: <https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/archive/refs/tags/v1.30.1.zip>
is it possible for a solana program call an external rest api?
oh. yes. this is your real qn.
AFAIK if you want to get the first mint.
you will need to use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress then 
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
and parse it until you get the mint to instruction. this will be the first owner.

basically for NFT, I think the oldest tx will contain the create mint instruciton and mint to instruciton. (just guessing, the more correctly ways is to find create mint and mint to)
what i did was mint NFTs and airdrop them to users. Now i have the empty accounts in my wallet left and would like to get rid of them. I created new associated token accounts while airdropping, but now i am afraid that closing the empty accounts in my wallet might affect the NFTs I airdropped. 
This fear is nonsense, right?
If you're mostly interacting with dapps on that wallet, chances are you'll be fine.  at worst, you can always recreate a new account.  If you want to test, create a bunch of accounts, then try doing your "close empty accounts" command, and see that the accounts are correctly cleaned up
I have a little bit confused what you are asking.
maybe give some context.
in solana we call token address as mint account
and token account is token account
both of them owned by token program
so would you ask your qn more detailly again?

you want to get token accounts from a mint account
or you want to get mint accounts from a token account
got it meaning i'm limited on my options here.. max two tokens and their accounts in one transaction
yes. tx has size limit. all you can do is just to decrease your tx size.
get program account is used to get all account owned by program.
so if you want to fetch something about token account or mint account you use it and give "params":["TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"]
but it will return all accounts to you and it is quite a lot data (not sure it can be returned correctly, it is very large).  so you have to add filter in the same rpc call.
have you tried this ? https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/advanced/token/get-all-token-account-by-owner/main.en.ts#L10-L20
remember to change the connection to correct network.
and this is the raw rpc call 
```
curl https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getTokenAccountsByOwner",
    "params": [
      "3D49QorJyNaL4rcpiynbuS3pRH4Y7EXEM6v6ZGaqfFGK", { "programId": "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"}
    ]
  }
'
```
UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Transaction too large: 1429 > 1232
i'm trying to mint like 5 tokens and create their account in one call but this is what i'm getting is there a way to go about doing this?

I corrected it a bit, and i even tried querying with a different address, address was wrong there, tried another one which wasnt a closed account but same reply still
check the docs https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getprogramaccounts
i can pay you time
So i need fund the developer want teach me how to implement Program in C
in this rpc. you should use owner to fetch token account.
I search the address on mainnet. it seems a token account which is closed.
May I know what does this error means? Thanks
Is there a method to check that/for unexpected results?
I did some tests in devnet now and it seems to work. But obviously i would like to be sure if it works as expected before running in mainnet / creating a pull request
I'm not familiar with the process too but depends on example helloworld. you can take a look at how it build program and deploy.
token address not a program.
when you use getProgramAccounts, you need to pass a program.
token address's program is token program `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`
that still does nothing in node js
:/
```js
const web3 = require('@solana/web3.js');

(async () => {

const testAddy = new web3.PublicKey('3D49QorJyNaL4rcpiynbuS3pRH4Y7EXEM6v6ZGaqfFGK')

    let account = await connection.getTokenAccountsByOwner(testAddy);
    console.log(account)
})();
```
but i not uderstand how can i do the deploy
I want use Alon for the implementation of Program https://lithdew.github.io/alon/
would you paste the pubkey here for me, the arguments should be a program.
I just got into the hole NFT world and would love to make my own project based on C++ where i would be able to make a small game where your equipment would be NFT's is there any good guids on how to set up Soalan development for c++?
yeah but i not know rust
here is the hello program.
https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/tree/master/src/program-c
if you switch rust, you can get resource easily.
yup. token transfer don't contain mint. only token transferChecked includes it.
if you want to get the mint from old version token transfer, you will need a extra api I think.
i don't have any good solution for now. I think basically you can get token's tx history and parse them until you got the first buyer.
I've uploaded a collection (via candy machine) of 12 NFTs on devnet but when I try minting them, the first one keeps getting minted repeatedly... Any idea why?
verify signature don't need any private keys.
you just need payload, signature, pubkey. those info is enough.
Hi Guys, i need have tutorial with the implementation of Program in C, i can pay the developer want teach me the implementation of program in C, i have a knowledge of C in the robotic scenario, and i want learn the implementation of Program in C
you can register a name for your token by create PR to this repo https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list
https://spl.solana.com/token is no mention of naming the token and giving it a ticker.  is that not done with solana?
anyone can recommend the best guide for creating solana tokens?  have bsc token, would like solana version, thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
I agree, I tried it, but the limit is it doesn't contain mint address and destination's owner address üôè
how we can verify signature as we are not getting any private key from the phantom wallet?
if you mean by mint account, I think you can use getProgramAccount https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getprogramaccounts
and filter them to your mint and balance.
this is the token account's detail
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/state.rs#L128
> Program failed to complete: Access violation in stack frame 1 at address 0x200001ff0 of size 8 by instruction #41208

Suddenly I have this issue while its never happened before. Anyone got any idea.
i have used https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/get-account-nfts/getAccountNFTs.ts this one but i didint get what i want from response
<@!788215642070581289> do u know where can i get the eighth account key from which is token metadata account ?  Here is the tx https://explorer.solana.com/tx/41u39idYAiGwWXrmbpaoZ9zN6m7zaiCdrvuMoxsfHQZghNbFDADc4deAxg1SK5ssnZPcV5fJJM5YtWRWQtq5Ztdo it is in Second Instruction
you can take a look at https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/advanced/token/get-all-token-account-by-owner/main.en.ts
not sure what you do but it just means your signature is wrong.
Hai is anyone created an solana wallet using react native ?
if you export private key. you can take a look at https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/create-keypair/main.en.ts#L23
if you export phrase, you can take a look at https://github.com/project-serum/spl-token-wallet/blob/master/src/utils/walletProvider/localStorage.js#L30-L37
token account owner and destination will hide in accounts.
when you get transaction back, you have already got all data. just parse it.
you can take a look at https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/287c3bedaf5ee5b49983495fd2826e84d35bc561/token/js/client/token.js#L1511
the main idea to parse it is to realize how it serializes and do it reverse.
take token transfer as an example.
the destination will be the second account in the instruction
the source of owner will be the third account in the instruction
Oh, shit ,got it
Any help about the problem?
try this
`  let response = await connection.getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner(
    publicKey,

Hi, when i upgrade authority got error `Error: Dynamic program error: No default signer found, run "solana-keygen new -o /homw/computer/deploy/id.json" to create a new one`, does anyone know why?
Use command `solana program set-upgrade-authority program-address-keypair.json --new-upgrade-authority new_authority.json`
I debuged and realise that this method `nacl.sign.detached.verify` returns `false` and that's why I getting this error, just want to know what can be the reason
I'm getting tx from our backend svc and I need to sign it and send into the solana, in it I has my signature and another one, and sending tx fails with `WalletSendTransactionError: Signature verification failed`
using web3 the secret key needs to be passed as an uint8array but how to get that if i have a wallet on phantom. I want to use that same wallet
I am parsing transaction, I used jsonParsed to get fully parsed data, but I also want to get owner address of source and destination (both of theyt are token accounts) in transfer / transfer checked instruction. How I can achieve that without any extra API call?
Hi, I want to know that is api.solscan.io OSS? I am interested in how they parse the transaction to get tokens_transfer_txs, and unknown_transfer_txs.
not sure what is you are asking but here is the source code https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/blob/master/nacl.js#L1083-L1094
any idea why a transaction on devnet that I can see on solana explorer cannot be found on solscan? Also the NFT I uploaded and minted cannot be seen (arweave says error with image and that it can't be shown). My png has a transparent background, does that affect anything?
Why `nacl.sign.detached.verify` can return false ?
amazing thank you!
seems your config is localnet
you can use `solana config set -ud` to set your config to devnet then get airdrop again
or use `solana airdrop 1 <your address here> -ud` to specific network (-u is --url, d is for devnet)
I must've missed something but not sure what- is there a way to airdrop it specifically through devnet?
hello, I've set configuration and tried to airdrop the validator acc 1 SOL but I'm getting this message

Hi there, yep! You can use `start_with_context()` from program-test, and then use `warp_to_slot` to move forward.  Here's an example in a test doing just that: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/f3e49cdf903e35952281e59c0943b6e724eb4ccc/program-test/tests/warp.rs#L125
It depends if those accounts are being used elsewhere.  Hopefully you're only using the associated token account, but there's no 100% guarantee
Hello! 
Is there a way to change current slot in solana_program_test? As i understand, when i send transactions with `BanksClient` slot in struct `Clock` is always 0
Hi team I got this error message when running ts-node on linux
Just to be sure:
Closing auxiliary token accounts which are empty does not have any side effects, right (apart from that i would need to create a new one when the token would be transferred back)
tysm! i will... be completely honest and admit that when i tried to use `useWallet` and the provider injection stuff etc i failed. weird issues that i suspect are me doing things to poison reactivity because the ref things get turned into proxy things, lots of my favorite error "Unhandled error during execution of scheduler flush. This is likely a Vue internals bug." which i love because it lies to me and says its not my fault. im stupid and dont understand frameworks. but!! when i was digging through the `wallet-adapter` code i saw i can skip all the weird complicated shit and use `PhantomWalletAdapter` and `SolletWalletAdapter` et al directly and these both seem to work perfect for me now! edit: nevermind i still get the crossorigin error rip
the point of `gc` is to move tokens from ancillary token accounts to associated token accounts, and then close  the ancillary token accounts.  you want to close all accounts with `amount == 0`, so they're different use cases.  please feel free to hack away! you may want to try on testnet before going to mainnet, just to be safe
Do you know why this check has been implemented? Modifying the code of the CLI feels wrong <:blob_sweat:792417931425218580> 
Maybe I need to learn a bit more about Solana Accounts beforehand
You can not re-allocate a size change to an account after it's creation at this time.
Possible to retrieve list of children account? I mean giving an executable program ID as input and receiving something like an array of accounts that has as owner the give ID
I fails because my backend sent me tx with it signature, and I add mine, I think, can I somehow send it with not mine signature?
GetConfirmedSignatures => Returns transaction hashes
GetParsedConfirmedTransaction => Returns details for a transaction by hash

Anyone attempted to use Solana RPCs with Elixir by chance?
but it not have a possibility to the deploy on the chain (testnet or devnet), right?
https://lithdew.github.io/alon/
i want use Alon for the implementation of my programs
Hi Guys
got the signatures, data etc
ie https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getParsedConfirmedTransaction
its hard to say without looking. why 1 fails and 1 succeeds if everything is the same wouldnt make sense.  off hand.  if something changes with the transactions, the signature of the transaction is missing or different, or doesnt match the required signers, if blockhash changed, there are lots of things, that could cause it. signatures can get invalidated or cleared if messing with the transaction after signed as well.
look at the Parsed versions of the calls in web3
walletController it's instance of `WalletStore`, provided with `useWallet()` from `@solana/wallet-adapter-vue`
value of what
I send it with the same way, and with same wallet, first one successful, second one fails with that error
cant provide link, its private repo
this is just an address key, could be any address key.. in this case its the vote program.  get signatures, for an address.  you put in any base58 encoded string address there
yes, I got tx from our backend svc,     

`const Uint8Tx = base58.decode(txHash)
    const tx = Transaction.from(Uint8Tx)
    return await walletController.sendTransaction(tx, connection)`
link to code. it usually means a signature is missing or wrong. your sending both transactions with the same wallet?
Hey, can somebody help, I`m trying to send tx with web3, first tx is okay, then I'll trying to send another one same way with @solana/wallet-adapter-vue with method sendTransaction but got error: WalletSendTransactionError: Signature verification failed
have anyone faced this error
'Transfer: `from` must not carry data',
hello everyone

I have a question about program owned accounts.. when we create an account we tell the program it's size now if i want to update the data content and add more data to the account.. would it be possible or not? since the additional data will exceed from the size allocated to it at creation.

hana ftw
cc <@!455114989397868556> the line "the runtime enforces that the account's data (the program) is immutable" says the programs _data_ is immutable. this specifically refers to the data buffer, not the account as a whole. you can in fact withdraw your lamports and cause the program account to be deallocated. this is what `solana program close` does
thanks lol
oh oof, sorry
Happy to have spared the channel from enduring a screenshot
screenshot bad
quicker than I could type ...
sorry, I was about to send a screenshot of what I meant before trent answered
getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner  <:trollface:552227154390286376>
it's always helpful share your code instead of making trent guess what you are doing
Yes
and the mint address is in the decoded data field?
Use `jsonParsed` encoding or decode the account data field yourself client side
I'm trying to recreate something like this which exists on the solana explorer
yeah I tried this and it has the token account public key in its return but not the mint address associated with it. Am I misunderstanding that these are two different things?
you mean this?
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountsbyowner
This would be great, any in particular you could point me to?
There are commercial custodians that support SOL
solana mainnet beta has been around for barely over a year, so there are no official standards. if you have an idea LMK
Like this is a core part of any major project I'm surprised a packaged solution doesn't exist.
Yeah, it's just that anyone coming in from outside blockchain wants an industry standard packaged app w/ good UX on top of the low level programmatic standards
the only rule is that there are no rules
I'm trying to get all the different tokens that a user owns
correct
Ah. So there's no standard implementation of this as a tool then. Everyone is creating bespoke solutions?
what are you trying to do?
https://docs.solana.com/offline-signing
That's the simplest way I can put it. On Ethereum multi party signing is used with the Gnosis Safe contract being the base layer for that. There are apps that sit on top of Gnosis Safe and add accounting features and more granular controls like spending limits for certain initiating signors
How are enterprises managing wallets and accounting on Solana?
hi, does anyone know how to use the solana/web3js library to get all the mint addresses for a wallet public key?
what do you actually want to do or know?
Wondering if anything similar exists on Solana. If not how are teams handling DAO and/or team funds
i'm not going to read that
https://gnosis-safe.io/enterprises
Enterprise industry standard multisig wallet on Ethereum.
what is this Gnosis Safe you speak of?
Does Solana have a Gnosis Safe equivalent or industry standard for multisig team wallets?
Let's say I want to use the canonical WSOL adress but there are already wsol, can I just unwrap all then do my things?
Is it accepted to unwrap user WSOL before a tx?

Is there a specific setup in EC2 AWS to run solana node because when i run in local machine there is no problem but when i run in ec2 permissions of the disk is getting modified and i am unable to access the instance ?
For the *pyth* users *How do we map pyth accounts with mint addresses on-chain?*

The use case is I would like my program to dynamically calculate the market cap for a specific vault based on the amounts of its token accounts. To do this in a decentralized way, it would have to be via an oracle like *pyth*.

My understanding is that doing this dynamically would require that I maintain some sort of mapping between mint addresses and their corresponding *pyth product / price accounts*. If this is the case, then should the mapping live on-chain as well?

Would appreciate guidance from anyone who has implemented a similar case previously üôÇ

Hey, everyone
Hi, guys
What should I put const base uri in my config. Js ?
BTW not 4 bytes only. I mean you have to add extra 4 bytes.
in borsh. the string length will store in the first 4 bytes.
so if your string length max is 10. your account will take 14 bytes to store it if you use borsh
Hai devs, 
Currently i'm trying to connect solanaweb3 using my react-native app, but when i installed solana as " npm install --save @solana/web3.js " and tried to use in my code as

console.log(solanaWeb3); 
and got an error message as :::

There's an example in this repo https://github.com/jsoneaday/solana-example-helloworld/blob/main/src/program-rust/src/lib.rs
I had no idea Batman was building on solana
Also, <@788215642070581289> ,Why is the limit to 4 bytes only .How do I store large url etc in account data field ?
Did that ,I redeployed program , created new account with new seed etc .But it still doesn't work .

pub counter: String (type didn't work ) .
Error - Transaction simulation failed . Program enable to serialise /deserialise.
in upgradable program. your program id like a proxy. the real program will store in the buffer.
I think the only way to do it is to fetch token account's tx history.
1. https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress
2. https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
when you change it. you will need to check 
1. your program need to modify and redeploy
2. your client need to a new account to store data and specific data length. (4 + your string max length)
what is buffer in solana deploy,any materials? thanks
as in the duration that has elapsed since receiving that token
does anyone know of a good way to track how long a token has been in a particular wallet?
Hey guys ,How do I change counter type from u32 to string in example hello world ? It doesn't work .I want to store string in account data field .

Idk why it‚Äôs trying for dependency packages for 1.9.0 thought 1.8.1 was the newest

AFAIK the rpc don't support this argument.
if you want to know balance changes, you can
1. get current balance
2. https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress to get historical txs
3. https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction to get each tx detail and compose historical data
Yeah I was following the git doc lemme link it
are you following any docs ?
Command ‚Äú cargo test ‚Äù
with what command?
I did cargo build fine now test is failing
Ubuntu 20.04 cargo Test
and what was the situation, a fresh install of the solana tools on what os/distro and this is from doing what? running what command
I don‚Äôt use Discord on pc but ok one sec ..
images like that are not friendly inline. and not mobile friendly. text works best in small portions, if large please use a pastebin gist, or other linking source.


Failed cargo test
for example, I am going to get user's balance at specific block
how historic?   you can use get slot and get block, to access and pull transactions.  but more historic requires having that data or archived data. some non public RPC nodes may have access to this data through bigTable or some archive node.
then how to get historical data?
i only see that call able to take a pubkey and commitment
no one knows?
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#sendtransaction  look at the preflight checks all over this page. 
source code under `send_transaction` has comments as well to see whats going on.  overview: verifies signatures, node check, and simulate transaction
It checks things to make sure they aren‚Äôt broken before submitting
Share the code
The transaction is the same one that has previously worked fine.
Can someone explain 'preflight' concept from the sendTransaction method?
what does your transaction look like?
Has anyone got experience with `Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found` as a consistent error? My code is calling `getRecentBlockhash` with `finalized` commitment, but still getting this error.
No, just trying to learn Solana CLI airdropping a sol on devnet.  I will try supplying a signature
Hello Devs, do you know how I can retrieve state for example: using getProgramAccounts but I want the result based in some block of the past? in ethereum if you have an archive node you can use any client and pass a blockTag with your block number expected and I don't want the latest only, thanks!
I've looked at Metaplex and Mango and found `array_ref!` serialization
its a potential optimization, yes. and many?  any notable ones you think are good examples?
so it looks like the public key your supplying needs a signature, if I read that correctly. is this an NFT drop?
Why are many project serializing data manually with `array_ref` as opposed to `BorshSerialize`, it it a space improvement?
Trying to airdrop on devnet.  Getting ```Error: Dynamic program error: missing signature for supplied pubkey```
I'm doing the latter now (I believe) -- `getSignaturesForAddress` returns signatures which then need to be fed to the `getTransaction` parameters, but then that method only accepts one signature per call no? Is there a way to feed it X signatures and receive transaction for each in return instead of issuing X separate `getTransaction` calls?
Hi guys, we're doing a collection called SolMosquitoes and currently need an experienced Web3 programmer to write the smart contract and every other code related aspects of the project. Programmer will be payed in percentage to be agreed on.
DM if interested.
Ok, lesson learnt. Whenever I see `AccountInfo` it's gonna be always from the client
https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/sysvars
Or are they like Pubkeys at the end of the day, requiring to be passed as accounts from client?
Ok, how about for sysvars tho, are they be able to be converted as `AccountInfo` inside the program?
You would use the token address as the param for `getSignaturesForAddress`. This will get all of the transaction signatures for your address(up to 2000 at a time). Then, if more info is needed, you can use `getTransaction` to get information on each individual transaction
You can get transactions given a block with `getBlock` or given an address with `getSignaturesForAddress`
ah thanks. didn't know they had their own discord
is there a way to get transactions in bulk?
Reach out on the anchor discord for anchor support https://discord.gg/nWvQT3Ge
does anybody else have problems installing anchor? getting package binary version is not correct. when I install the required version it complains about another version
I think you're after getting transactions given a token. You can use `getSignaturesForAddress` https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress to get transaction signatures given a token address. Then you can use the previously mentioned `getTransaction` given a signature to get more information
I would reach out to Metaplex and see if they have anything related to NFTs
`getTransaction` is used solely to get transaction information given a transaction signature. What are you trying to do with a token?
Hi. Does SPL support the ability to merge two non fungible tokens into 1 non fungible token?
change your `Content-Type` header to `application/json`
Aight, Thanks.
Tonight if you guys are awake
you have to pass in the account to the program, to get the account info.  which would likely include an initialize type attribute if one exists.
need more info
Yes, you must use the signature of whatever transaction you are looking up + encoding(`json` in your ss)
mainnet-beta is `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`
Here are some of the endpoint https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints
Given a signature, you can get the transaction using `getTransaction` https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
But if you have a vague Idea to give me something to think about while I‚Äôm on the road I‚Äôll greatly appreciate it
Ahhh not home I‚Äôll be able to send it tonight
What's the exact stacktrace? I'm seeing some people have issues with this in the past
<@!785084693023424542>
Or if it's not possible, is there a way atleast to just check an account is initialized or not with just a PubKey?
Umm, lol. I'm in a bit confused state. 
So let's say I have just the Pubkey inside a program and not an AccountInfo (basically all the internal Solana state, lamports, is_signer, is_writable etc). 

Would I be able to convert just a Pubkey to an AccountInfo inside?
But has anyone experienced anything similar to this ?
I‚Äôm not in front of my CPU
It‚Äôs toward the end
I have good connection
Saying it can‚Äôt fetch GIT
Some of the crates aren‚Äôt being fetched
Is it normal that my cargo test fails at the end
see if this helps:
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#hash-based-generated-program-addresses
But obviously I want to avoid storing a separate key for every user, and just use their address to generate the data account address, yeah?
I have a working example using Keypair.generate w/ a deployed smart contract, yes
do you know how PDAs work?
<@!785084693023424542> If the program is the signer, what goes in the signers value?
I do not understand, can you clarify?   if you understand that you need to pass in.. how can you do without passing in?
"I understand that I need to pass it in order to check. What I'm asking is can it be done without passing"
I have the program address. What I need is the signer
the commends in the web3 js file for these. they are the best docs üôÇ
for that one, for example: * Derive a program address from seeds and a program ID.
I understand that I need to pass it in order to check. What I'm asking is can it be done without passing üôÇ
Thank you lisenmayben I appreciate your responses
that would be part of your program, or account based on the program.  if you check the token program for example, it has an account initialization instruction, that it checks.  there are isInitialized checks as well in Solana source you can check for reference.
Is this a program derived address?
```
PublicKey.createProgramAddress(
  [user.publicKey.toBuffer()],
  programId
)
```
How do I indicate that the program is the signer?
Maybe using AccountMeta would work?
Inside the program?
Ahh, I see, so I really don't wanna send a PDA related account inside (lol). Is there a way to like check if an address is intialized or not initliazed?
with a program derived address, yes.
inside the program, the program is expected to have the information it needs available. so you would pass accounts in, that you want the account info for.
In one example the result from `Keypair.generate` is being passed as a signer so I'm not sure how to get around that. Can the program be the signer?
```
const transaction = program.transaction.create({
  accounts: {
    baseAccount: accountKeypair.publicKey,
    user: window.solana.publicKey,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
  },
  signers: [accountKeypair],
});
```
that is an entire topic itself related to protection and security.   firewalls, encryption, passwords, usage, access, accounts, best judgement and some common sense. related computer security sites and firms may be good resources and various other websites.
Noob question. Let's say I create a Program Derived Address inside a program. 
Is there a way to get that's address's account info? 

Like in the client side we have something like `connection.getAccountInfo` right? Is there a similar/any way to get account's info inside a program's instruction?
Very generous, thank you for sharing. Will try it out now!
you may want to look at `createWithSeed`

Here's full end to end from public key -> all NFT metadata https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/tree/master/src/get-account-nfts
You could pull out what you need to just mints
Is it possible to manage per-user data using the user address as a seed? I see examples using `Keypair.generate()`, but would it be possible to replace this with something like:
```
PublicKey.createProgramAddress(
  [user.publicKey.toBuffer()],
  programId
)
```
Question: Given the address of an NFT, how do we query for its metadata?
Oh ok thanks
He means you could clone this project and play around with it to get inspiration.

Thank you checking it out
Yeah that‚Äôs the thing I can‚Äôt find any project similar to this also what exactly does scaffolding mean
try this out
https://learn.figment.io/pathways/solana-pathway
The answers to this are endless. Probably best you go find some scaffolding, or reference another project
It's good feedback(I wrote the docs). I would recommend checking out https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter for the send/sign/connect calls
Or does it not matter
If I‚Äôm doing a custom project. What should my first line of code be ?
ok i didn't know if there was a standard way, thanks.
Wallets have different ways of sending transactions and using the keypair. You would have to consult to specific wallet's docs to understand that
It depends on the program. Are you doing it on a native program? There's some js bindings for those. Otherwise you'll have to deserialize it yourself
I'm just confused about the implementation -- why the cast to u64 when there are 5 arguments?
I believe you can use `msg!` in your program and try `simulateTransaction` to see the logs
```#[macro_export]
macro_rules! msg {
    ($msg:expr) => {
        $crate::log::sol_log($msg)
    };
    ($arg1:expr, $arg2:expr, $arg3:expr, $arg4:expr, $arg5:expr) => {
        $crate::log::sol_log_64(
            $arg1 as u64,
            $arg2 as u64,
            $arg3 as u64,
            $arg4 as u64,
            $arg5 as u64,
        )
    };
    ($($arg:tt)*) => ($crate::log::sol_log(&format!($($arg)*)));
}``` how come the `msg!` macro has different behavior when there are exactly five arguments? Just ran into this problem, it was a headache to figure out!

right but for mainnet i'd need to connect a wallet, it's not clear how to use a keypair from my connected wallet.  I think that's the connection I'm missing from these tutorials.
Greetings,

I am trying to run a candy-machine but failing miserably..

So I pulled metaplex, installed solana, cloned candy-machine-mint. After that yarn installed everything and started the machine.

At first it works fine, but few seconds after i connect a phanton wallet it throws an error
Would I have to make a copy of the on chain program, and run it locally?
Could you point me to resources for debugging transactions when sent to an on chain program?
You can airdrop on local, devnet, and testnet
Can you provide any more details ?
Hi, this may be a silly question but I keep seeing a lot of the following pattern in tutorials: 
```
      var fromWallet = web3.Keypair.generate();
      var fromAirdropSignature = await this.connection.requestAirdrop(
        fromWallet.publicKey,
        web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
      );
      await this.connection.confirmTransaction(fromAirdropSignature);
```
I assume you can only airdrop on testnet?  How would one create a usable keypair out of their connected Phantom wallet?
I believe most NFT discords extend https://github.com/MonkeDAO/observer
Hey, is anyone aware of a guide or a generic repo for making NFT sales bots? Thinking of creating one if not
yep
Right if you look at the bottom of the error message it says `remote: Permission to solana-labs/ecosystem.git denied to github-actions[bot].`
I'll do a repro project showing both and report a bug
mainnet rpc from solana
looks like the prettier portion of the check failed with that err
It's possible that something got deployed without secondary indexes enabled
Are you sure both clients are hitting the same RPC backend?
It's the server waiting on the request, nothing to do with optimizations
Right. However I see the similar issue happening to other PRs as well e.g. https://github.com/solana-labs/ecosystem/pull/596
strange. usually the github permission issue is related to trying to PR the repo itself without a fork and branch.
yep! Forked from https://github.com/tomoima525/ecosystem
are you using a fork to submit the PR?

No, it's part of the core infra, nodes won't commit a tx if they revert. that's one of the core constraints of the system.
submit another pr. This process will likely change in the future. Deletions may take longer to get through due to the automerge behavior
Please provide the line of code to connect to the main Solana web3 object, using index.iife.min.js in the client-side "browser" version.

For example, with Ethereum web3 the following line will create that object for the Polygon network:
    var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("https://polygon-mainnet.infura.io/v3/" + csInfuraID))

In the "index.iife.min.js" file that I was advised to download, it appears the main object is called "solanaWeb3". 

The following code displayed "solanaWeb3.clusterApiUrl is not a function":
    const connection = new solanaWeb3.Connection(

Hi all, two questions regarding the solana-labs token-list:

1. I created a new fungible token and added the item to the solana-labs token-list. It is displaying in Phantom now but it shows up in the "Your Collectibles" tab instead of the main tab where other fungible tokens are shown. I *think* this is because I included "nft" under the tags in the json description for the token-list (since it is for an NFT game). Can someone confirm if that is the case and if it is expected behavior?

2. Assuming this is expected Phantom behavior, what is the process for updating the solana-labs token-list to fix my json description? Auto-merge only works for additions, not deletions, so do I just submit a pull request and wait for the team to complete a PR review?
I mean, does the account_info of the token account reflect the new amount after minting to it, right after the invoke. So same function still. Or is the actual amount amount+mint_amount?
Thank you so much, I‚Äôll take a look at the code and check in with the team
sosol is a social network built on top of Solana https://my.sosol.app/ https://github.com/sosol-gmi
The writing in this case would be a user wants to do something like change their avatar and pays a gas fee to execute
I know contracts ‚Äú read ‚Äú but has anyone created a platform to let users ‚Äú write ‚Äú
I wanted to ask you a question. Has anyone developed a protocol yet that lets users change the blockchain by writing ? Similar to a social network ?
Hey chido
I can check this myself but am on a train right now and just wondering
If, while processing an instruction, I mint to a token account using invoke, does the token account hold the new balance or is not updated after invoke?
I think you will need to do rpc call twice üò¢ because it is `AND`
Yeah I found a workaround that works for me. I hope readonly data becomes freely available to on chain programs in the future. Thanks
AFAIK solana don't support other token's stake so if you want have the features. you need to write your custom program.
I don't think you can fetch it on program but I can give you some possible ways
1. pack all token holders into your tx but it will hit tx size limit if there are too many accounts.
2. maintain a account and store all token holders into it but it will hit compute units if there are too many accounts
Are there any circumstances where a program can panic and the tx isn't fully reverted?
Unless I am reading this incorrectly, it looks like you can provide multiple https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/validator/src/bin/solana-test-validator.rs#L162

is there a way to start a `solana-test-validator` with multiple custom program loaded in from the beginning, i.e. some way to use the `--bpf-program` option multiple times? I'd like to load in a bunch of SPL programs automatically instead of running `solana program deploy` a bunch
Hey guys, there is any way to validate that a blockhash is valid?
Can somehow multiple `memcmp` filters on `getProgramAccounts()` be used as `OR` instead of `AND`. Looking for the same address in two different spots in memory, would love to fit in one call?
(and avoid React app re-rendering along the way)
looks like raydium is still using Serum markets for underlying as well
hey all, what's the most current AMM implementation out there that one can deploy to? I don't want the serum pools, something more like Uniswap. Looks like Oyster is dead, what's the standard today?
Wow thanks for the quick reply <@!489206164270350337> Amazing working with Solana!!
This will give all metadata given an account. You can cut what you need from there

Quick one, how can I grab the Metadata for any given NFT? is that possible via the RPC API?
Thank you very much ‚ù§Ô∏è
I know it's possible with an rpc call
hi, is it possible to list token holders inside a program?
I know you can do it with an rpc call

Do the commitment levels for RPC calls and the slotsUpdatesSubscribe and accountsdb_plugin_interface::SlotStatus values map to one another? Is it like this?
```
    rpc           accountsdb         slotsUpdatesSubscribe
"processed"  ==   "processed"   ==   "completed"
"confirmed"  ==   "confirmed"   ==   "optimisticConfirmation"
"finalized"  ==   "rooted"      ==   "root"
```
other token's stake
you are asking SOL‚Äôs stake or other token‚Äôs stake?
not sure i understand your qn. but if you want to test your program. you can take a look at example hello world repository
getTokenAccoutByOwner only return token accounts which you own
what did you get from the new account? in solana we usually use base58 encode string to represent address
I am still not clear with this thing that what rewards are actually distributed? I just want to know what we get as a reward and from where is this reward calculated
hello, tell me where can I ask to replenish the wallet in the Dev network for smart tests?
perfect! any idea on hw requirements?
<@788215642070581289> In case if I have wallet already created, and there is default SOL Token it. But when ai hit getTokenAccountByOwner it doesn‚Äôt give me that SOL default token
Can I get owner address of a new wallet by any method. I actually just need that.
I am creating a wallet from Torus but how to get public address for a new account
<@!788215642070581289> thankss
maybe take a look at https://github.com/project-serum/stake
can you share some resources it hard to find
not sure what you mean. if you want to implement your own stake program I think you can do many things you want.
and can we customize the staking rewards to be distributed?
when the epoch end, rewards will distribute in next epoch's first block.
you can use get block to retrieve them
you can request some airdrop to your account.
<@!788215642070581289>  In what form are the staking rewards distributed. Like do we get rewarded from the tokens locked in contract or any other form.
But I have key from Torus but there is no owner account coming from solana as it‚Äôs 0 balance account
I think you can use 
```
  // create a new keypair
  let alice = Keypair.generate();

  // you can use this way to get pubkey
  // normally use base58 format for pubkey
  console.log(`pubkey: ${alice.publicKey.toBase58()}`);
```
and it is written in the first example
And can I create a normal account which can return me public address of wallet. I mean create a wallet
you can't create a token account without mint. every token account must created with mint
<@788215642070581289> Thanks for the reply. If I go for create associateaccount what needs to be pass in mint address since by default there is no mint
In what form are the staking rewards distributed. Like do we get rewarded from the tokens locked in contract or any other form.

I would leave a comment and or issue in the github to help get some attention, per the github instructions. is the best way. a lot to go through. a lot of conflict PRs.
https://github.com/AppleheadFinance/ecosystem/branches So I see that Default branch is master but another rmshea branch is main is it wrong?
collectively yes. you dont deploy a token. you create a token with the SPL-Token program. if you go through the SPL-Token docs it explains as you go and try it out.
so ecosystem only understand token that deployed by Token Program?
All SPL Tokens typically use the same common program.  If you modify and deploy your own version, it wouldn't be understood by the SPL Token ecosystem.
i tried it. can i add some function to my spl-token and deploy?
Fine
its the token standard.   SPL-Token.   like Metaplex is the NFT standard, still using SPL-Token under the hood.
walk through this and see how it works.  after you have rust and Solana installed.
https://spl.solana.com/token
spl-token is only way for deploy token?
just waiting to hear from someone. dont think so. but not sure.
So this problem is not on my side?
last I heard this related issue was being looked into.
every spl-token is internally 'owned' by the token program and the 'authority' is assigned
is every solana token controlled by token program?
Whats wrong?
https://github.com/solana-labs/ecosystem/runs/4030946760?check_suite_focus=true
for time. itself, check the governance program in the spl.  `advance_clock`. they have some of the better related examples to warp and time
I'm using `warp_to_slot` but not noticing any changes to the clock time. Am I using it wrong?
```rust
let mut ptc = test.start_with_context().await;
ptc.warp_to_slot(slot).unwrap();
let clock = ptc.banks_client.get_clock().await.unwrap();
println!("{}", clock.unix_timestamp);
```
https://discord.gg/metaplex
Thanks üôÇ
Yes I changed "main" and worked
as mentioned in post above the branch may have to stay master in the fork for the PR, are you trying to create a new branch?   `A branch or tag with the name 'Applehead-branch' could not be found` try submitting the PR on your master branch fork
Yeah space is 32kb and some change. Thanks for the help, I'll ask on Anchor discord
if I want to make an NFT sales bot - do I pretty much have call `getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2` with the NFT marketplace's address and then manually scrape and pattern match on the transactions?
are you setting the space there to about 32 k?  im not sure in this case with only the code there why it would be a pda or inner..   they would know, possibly with more code.
OS APIs like the clock should be wrapped in a trait with a test only implementation for that purpose
look up 'warp'
Yeah, maybe this is a question for Anchor Discord. I thought the `#[account(init)]` macro created a system account owned by the current program.
Is there a way to tick the clock forward to simulate time passing in rust tests?
this looks like anchor
Yeah, I thought I *was* creating a program owned account, not a PDA.

```rust
[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = user, space = 8 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 32 * 1000)]
    pub whitelist: Account<'info, Whitelist>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```
what more details should i provide ?
410 means that call is not there or wrong.  something with your call might be different or changed for mainnet. you didnt share many details so hard to say.

copy and paste the text for errors  where its not too long. you can link to more info. you might have to use a master branch on your fork and not your own new branch like you might typically do.  might be different for different repos. if it doesnt say in the guide or readme look at the issues and other submissions may help too.

https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/program
is this token program source?
there is not a friendly or eco system friendly way currently to customize tokens.  you can fill out token meta data with the spl-token list, but further customization adopted by the ecosystem is tbd;    *you can customize and create what you want, but it would likely not mix well in the current greater eco.
hello. can i deploy token with addtional function?
yea interesting that it behaves differently
that api is hosted by project serum, and im not currently sure what differences if any may exist or why you did not get data. someone else may know. i know it does get used.
<@!785084693023424542> also turns out that the issue earlier was not from weird params, but a different rpc endpoint. https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com works for requesting data but https://solana-api.projectserum.com does not
cool thanks
yes. its the 'token' program.  this is the underlying owning program, for all SPL-Tokens. u create and perform the token functions with this program. and it is the token standard.
SolScan abbreviates it to "Token Program" so I figure it's something standard
One more question, the `getTokenAccountsByOwner` RPC calls requires a program id or mint parameter. I've been using `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` as the program id just from some random digging in solscan. This seems to be the program used by all of my SPL tokens, is it some high level program that all tokens derive from?
thanks u!
I"m assuming that's what the problem was
bam
thanks for the help
I just tried using the python sdk and it worked perfectly
otherwise there are a few SDKs, including I think a metaplex python implementation or 2
well if your doing that, its good to reference the web3 docs, and source code if needed, that way you can make sure to include what is expected,  including any defaults -   its possible a bad default or missed param netted you no results.
I was but I had a few issues so I'm just making raw requests now
sorry should've mentioned that haha
web3,  ahh, see minor details üôÇ  are you using a python sdk?
maybe some params are being set in the back end
hmm ok I'll check out js then
yes this works
this works for you? I'm not using JS I'm making direct POST requests in Python
`const web3 = require('@solana/web3.js');
const pubKey = new web3.PublicKey(
  "7brh6t1YvSccr5URUfZKGxfkPHFUmxhbaaAzV31Gi675")

let transactions = await connection.getSignaturesForAddress(pubKey);
console.log('transactions: ', transactions);`
main
is this in dev, main or?
you can get devnet sol with 'airdrop'.    otherwise there isnt much in the way of devnet tokens, or faucets, that I know of personally.  serum, and some others have devnet related known tokens, otherwise its based on the owners of the mints.
just meaning, additional methods, things like graphQL based queries or services, other RPC nodes, SDKs, and other things people appear to be working on for future simplification.
hey how can i get Devnet Tokens?
hmm.   is it an address you can share?
What do you mean by this? Is there some other source I can directly query? I've been using the Solana RPC API
you can parse transactions, accounts, logs, events, etc.. like others are doing. its just more complex atm.  other services and ways to do things are coming, building, and improving. eventually many things may appear to be much simpler in the future.
Yeah sorry. I'm using the getSignaturesForAddress call which if I understand correctly is supposed to return signatures for confirmed transactions involving the address passed in. When I use my personal public address which has a couple dozen transactions I get back an empty list of no transactions.
can you be more specific? what are you trying to do, what are you expecting, and what are you actually receiving?
for example, none of my getTransaction or getSignature calls are returning anything even though I'm testing wallets with multiple txs
thanks for the response, it seems like the solana rpc api is pretty limited. How do other applications get more data from the blockchain?
thanks <@!785084693023424542>  think I understood the temporary access bit, but is it fair to say that this is just a design choice and we can build a swap program that just transfer directly using the owner pubkey as authority (without doing the extra delegate step). Just trying to understand design choice here.
try some of these NFT and Metadata related resources:
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/886259112105635940/886269376196657172
NFTs and ownership and the mints and collections may work a little differently.
it has a lot to do with how the token swap program works, but short answer, is that you delegate/approve the swap program to transfer funds from your account to accounts it has authority over, performs the swap and any fee assessment, and then transfers the resulting swap token to the destination account, theoretically if it fails or completes it revokes the delegation/approval on your account to transfer funds.  its a way to transfer temporary account delegation with funds access and do work, and after done relinquish access.
trying to use solana rpc api to verify if a user owns a specific NFT, how should I go requesting the data? I tried getTokenAccountsByOwner but the only value that works is the general token program
https://gist.github.com/Aadhinana/52481ddebda0ae1a87bea067086cac07
Wrote this small gist that will close accounts. Need to write the loop to automate it.
But now can manually run this and check to see if accounts get closed.

I tried and it works! Thanks a lot.
Thank you <@!489206164270350337>
Appreciate it. thanks!
but not yet everything around it
Ok yeah for a single acc there is a function, sure
Was searching for a JS function first. I would expect that there is one but did not find a good and already implemented one. Modified the Solana CLI now for my approach and will create a pull request in a few days
Thank you!
use `closeAccount` from `@solana/spl-token`
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L1109
Is there a way to do this with JS currently?
oh sorry I missed that, thank you!!
that's perfect, ty
Have you checked https://spl.solana.com/
how to do actions from within a program? For example I want to transfer token mint authority to program and use it for minting.
ty tho
actually thinking about it more im pretty sure this is an issue with how sollet and vue interact (is there an iframe in there somewhere?), or possibly something with sollet.io (headers or something? idk), not anything with rpc servers. the issue is unrelated to submitting transactions and occurs even with solana-test-validator
Any program owned account or program derived account  (PDA) can store data. The former allows up to 10 MB and the latter up to 10 K.
im also using vue. i get that error with both sol-wallet-adapter and wallet-adapter
yes that is the same thing
The exact issue mentioned here https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/issues/125
<@!811633301747531786> , aren't you having some cross origin problem between your browsers though?

I know there's been some cat and mouse
or wait do you mean i have to beg someone to whitelist me
I'm not sure exactly how the origin blocking is implemented
got yah ! I miss SQL üôÇ
also if youre making a large social media type thing then using getProgramAccounts is very quickly going to become imposisble lol you need to have a clever namespacing scheme under pdas
then accept that getProgramAccounts() returns list in a random order, then sort them using JS/TS ?
oh wait so like... sollet doesnt work with certain rpc endpoints?
store the date in the data, theres a clock sysvar. if you want to have x most recent replies to a post or something then have an extra ringbuffer and update it when new replies are posted
You'd have to store that information in the account
If you're targeting the public RPC infra, it's heavily origin restricted because clowns kept doing poorly coded  NFT drops targeting them
since sollet works fine fine me in other projects
its so weird i really dont understand whats wrong w it
<@!585868308419444749> so let's just say if we build a quora type application, how do we show the recent questions first ?
<@!455114989397868556> i didnt figure out the cross origin problem but i enabled the sollet code anyway in case anyone wants to try https://2501babe.github.io/tools/revoken.html
There's no notion of "created" date
it looks like the created date of an account isn't being returned anywhere. I am even thinking to add a custom created_date field to the account and sort them on the JS client side. though, this is quite inefficient. any thoughts ?
question hope someone might be able to help : is there a way to call getProgramAccounts() returning the list of accounts sorted by createDate of the account ?
you can check the Solana eco system page or general chat, otherwise I am not sure specifically on those things. https://solana.com/ecosystem. there are many amms.
I am not sure if there exists an implementation today. Most amms are using some variation of https://spl.solana.com/token-swap
I'm afraid it is. I still cannot understand how to keep data and sign transactions within a program. AFAIK I can keep data with PDAs, but once I try to do some action, for example to send lamports, I get that account cannot have data. Should I create an account without data for this?

You can use `getSignaturesForAddress` and `getTransaction` to get details of each transaction given an address https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress

sorry for reposting: is Metaplex the only way to create NFTs? What's the equivalent in Solana of Ethereum's Smart Contracts? I want to create an NFT collection
technically I think I can find it by look up in the transactions but it isn't an efficient way
how to get the owner of deleted token account? (like this https://explorer.solana.com/address/Apm7WhkSMtva6t8VxDDAGKqSSoxmvrYJxmo7i6V6bTJ7)

You could also check metaplex discord if anyone has already extended candy machine like you're proposing
I am not entirely sure how candy machine works, but you could write something like a permissionless crank that will do what you're asking. You will, however, still need to execute the instruction
And we are working on a new program ABI that will allow realloc up to account max
We have a yet to be released/activated feature that will allow a general realloc of an accounts data, but still capped at 10k per top level instruction
Is this still on the road map to be removed? It's pretty limiting when a program is owned by governance
Yeah, you can use the adapters directly with no framework. Are you getting the cross origin error running remotely or only on localhost? Someone here had a similar issue (Vue, Sollet, `Blocked a frame with origin`): https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/issues/125

It seems like it's a Vue / config issue though, as the React-based demo @ https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/example/ works. Please do open an issue if you find out what it is and I can document it in the FAQ
sorry if I'm being too much of a noob, I've just been trying to figure this out all day. The program that I want to build would work as a treasury account for a metaplex candy machine. It would receive lamports on mint and then divide those according to the shares of the creators. It seems like a pretty simple program, which is why I am so frustrated. I thought there was a way for an on-chain program to look at itself (ie. the balance of lamports) and divide these accordingly and then send a portion of this balance to each creator. Is this possible to do automatically on-chain or do I have to build a JS client and call the on-chain program manually?
Correct
Hi guys! is there a way to get the owners of a NFT? I have all the mint hashes and want to get a list of pubkeys of every wallet holding at least 1 of the NFTs.
Without executing an instruction on the program, nothing will happen.
ie. can a program not interact on the receipt of a specific amount of lamports and then run logic to divide them and do another airdrop?
can the data they receive not simply be lamports airdropped to the program account?

thanks. trying to wrap my mind around the 'associated token account' concept
*shakes magic 8-ball* üé±   signs point to uncertain optimism
For some definition of _associated_
I notice that there's a new instruction to request an increase to the heap frame size -- could anyone explain what the heap frame is/its implications?
going out on a limb, and saying yes üôÇ
https://github.com/libusb/libusb/releases
Make sure you have the monorepo system dependencies installed. https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/#1-install-rustc-cargo-and-rustfmt
I get this error when I want to import solana-client:
```
[ERROR rust_analyzer::reload] failed to switch build data: rust-analyzer failed to run build scripts:

thanks, those are the two I'm just looking at, so great.
`solana-client` and `solana-sdk` should be sufficient for those tasks

Maybe you know, how i can transfer nft from my account to another one?
Hi all, I know very little about the solana ecosystem, but I have some experience with bitcoin and ethereum. This weekend I would like to write some lines of code that will allow me to connect to the network and query balances and if possible transfer SOL. I work with Rust, what crates do you suggest me to use? thank you very much.
hello, is there anyone that I could ask questions about creating token's DAO?
OMG Thank you so much!!!
this might be a stupid question, but can each account only have one non-native token balance associated with it?
This should help https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/get-account-nfts/getAccountNFTs.ts
hello, how to get all the nft from my wallet, through the frontend
haha that's the question innit?
That's the current standard, yes
ah so all token addresses that are associated with a user's public key are associated token addresses
Thanks for the quick response
The current standard for NFTs is through Metaplex. Other than that, you're looking for Program standards, jet-protocol's code is very clean. As well as serum governance and a few others
Hello Devs :D, hope you are fine.
Coming from EVM background and wanted to check if theres anything similaire to Openzeppelin (ERC271) where can i see `programs` and best practices, also would love to know if theres any `ERC` like implementation specially for NFTs. so far i found metaplex but dont think will be enough for my case as i need to cover more business logic within the program
how do I use this merkle tree thing?
Check out the implementation of `getAssociatedTokenAddress` https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/287c3bedaf5ee5b49983495fd2826e84d35bc561/token/js/client/token.js#L2277
if the public key for a program is generated randomly, how do wallets find the account associated with a particular user?
I'll say it again, quit using public RPCs, get a free dev account here or on Sol beach, or $9/month account on Quicknode: https://datahub.figment.io/
You have to check your devnet status again and try to set your keypair path with devnet as well!
Saber has a this merkle tree distributor: https://github.com/saber-hq/merkle-distributor

Otherwise you can look to the anchor/tests/lockup contracts, specifically the whitelist portion. I'm looking at doing something similar, but with diffferent amounts for recipients, so I'm starting with a simple script. 

The short of it is that you can't get away with funding the recipient token account, so you're talking about 0.003 SOL per pubkey.
there can be more than 1 token as long as they are non fungible
*COUGH* StarAtlas *COUGH*
Also, it looks like newly created accounts are created with a random keypair? Wouldn't it be simpler to just allow creating random + deterministic addresses for accounts? I'm assuming that when the owner of the account changes from the system_program that the private key is no longer able to sign for the account
Looking at the `create_account` instruction in the solana sdk and curious what the purpose of the `account_metas` is? The from_pubkey is the account paying for the fee but what is the `to_account`? Is that the newly created account?

The code for reference: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/system_instruction.rs#L307
Its possible to have multiple recieving addresses for a main account or derive multiple addresses and use only 1 secret key to sign all of them? I have been testing with createAccountWithSeed but doesnt seem to work when i try to sign a transfer from a secondary address to the main.
Then they must have airdropped by creating your account
I created others I believe, like USDT
not that i remember
I never willingly created a samoyedcoin account / token
I don't know if Samo was created before or after this change, but airdrops used to have to ask each individual member to add their account them selves. Fees were paid by the receivers instead of the senders. I know this was the case with COPE
I may be wrong though
Doesn't look like it
means 0.04$ back then. That's still not very cheap if they dropped to like 100k people
0.40$ right now
They probably paid the minimum rent exemption amount. Back in the day 0.002xxx sol was nothing
Thank you! I was just curious if there are any more detailed docs about genesis configuration and so on
A bunch of scripts exist here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/multinode-demo that allow you to do what you're asking. There's some information about it here https://docs.solana.com/cluster/bench-tps#multinode-testnet
so how did someone like samoyedcoin do the massive airdrop? I still have my coins from back in the day.
What you're doing is providing the rent to make that account exempt from rent fees in the future. You could lower the amount, but the accounts may be swept at the end of an epoch if the amount is too low
is it possible to multi airdrop a token to lots of people and fund their accounts for cheap?

Like instead of paying 0.00203928 SOl for each funding, paying 0.00203928 SOL to fund lets say 1000 accounts?
Adding to this question, is there a guide to deploy a network on multiple machines?
Yeah that seems interesting! Thanks for answering me üôÇ
Not sure why it may not be included, but you're welcome to add it and submit a PR https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/explorer
Thank you very much! This makes sense now, I could see that when getting the transaction through JSON-RPC:
```
...

        {
          "commission": null,
          "lamports": -2439,
          "postBalance": 55122,                                                                                                                         
          "pubkey": "76XewBcVwdmYE5nb15a9wPYJZYFPuvMW5GPiVnrAAYgG",
          "rewardType": "Rent"
        }
      ],
...
```
 Is there any reason for this to not be available on the explorer's transaction page? Would this be a valuable new feature?
ok so there is no clear definition of an NFT.
Pyth did some NFTs just like that
Like multiple copies of the same
ahh
Something to mention though is that some people call something an NFT even though there may be >1 tokens
That is not a NFT, no.
There's a few being made right now.

Could you please give me more info on this. And how to resolve it
**What is the best Online Rust IDE and Compiler (that is usable within Chrome)?**
I have experience creating Ethereum smart contacts online, using <http://remix.ethereum.org/>.

I now wish to create Solana smart contracts using Rust. I don't want to install anything on my server, so I am researching Online Rust IDE's and Compilers, that can be used from within Chrome.

Here are several that I found:
<https://play.rust-lang.org/>
<https://replit.com/languages/rust>
<https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_rust_online.php>
<https://codeanywhere.com/languages/rust>
<https://ideone.com/l/rust>

Is one of these considered to be the "go-to" for Solana (like remix is the go-to for Ethereum)?
And MetaSerum has decimals 0 but supply 11 is NOT an NFT, correct?
Each NFT usually ends up having its own associated token account
(due to supply being 1, am guessing that means each is its own unique token)
so does that mean each NFT has its own account?
Thank you <@!489206164270350337>
Yes. Most use Metaplex, which has some more metadata attached
hello, is implementing a token that features reflections possible as you don't have access to a list of holders inside a program?
i think the issue was that my account was created with the old endpoint and I tried to execute the other commands with the new endpoints.

I followed it from the beginning again with the new endpoint and it seems to work, thank you!
Did you follow https://spl.solana.com/token#example-creating-your-own-fungible-token?
From reading other discord logs, looks like you may have been rate limited
Hello everybody!
I've submitted a transaction on testnet to transfer 0.1 SOL between two accounts, which had a 0.000005 SOL fee.
What I don't currently understand is that apparently while the sender account has a change of -0.100005 SOL, the receiver received 0.099997561 SOL (see solana explorer image attached).

Can anybody tell me where did the remaining 0.000002439 SOL go?

Here is the link of the transaction: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/s1GDbd2okApGhGbEZVMsHPbBc2Rr1B24yfpvLwY6oAn5CwMZaycDDb8cZgPDJsphom3bJuB6YvMkAiXYZcGtZZ7?cluster=testnet
Hey all, I'm looking at the JS code for interacting with SPL: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/287c3bedaf5ee5b49983495fd2826e84d35bc561/token/js/client/token.js#L286

The token constructor has the following params:
`  /**
   * Create a Token object attached to the specific mint
   *
   * @param connection The connection to use
   * @param token Public key of the mint
   * @param programId token programId
   * @param payer Payer of fees
...`

Am I right in thinking that thee program ID is parameterised because the token program can be upgraded and its address may change?
sure, I will check in metaplex
Oh thank you, I changed that but still got an error:

spl-token create-account XXXX
Creating account YYYY
RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x2 [18 log messages]
Your endpoint needs to be https://api.devnet.solana.com
It simply means that you balance is not high enough for whatever you may be doing
I saw you were querying metaplex? I have heard some people having difficulty due to the large dataset, especially in web3 on nodejs.
What you're querying has a ton of data, and is very expensive. Check metaplex if they have any clever querying on their accounts

Hello please who manages the solana ecosystem github page

I made a git push request its need approval its been 3 days already Ryan
Can someone provide an query example for `getProgramAccounts` for JavaScript ? My query is taking very long time to respond.
<@814228493302497301>
Yeah I am getting this if I am doing transaction for less balance but the Js should not crash
Is this for your program?
For a transaction if I have insufficient lamports, Can I show error instead of the crash. Right now solana web3Js library crashes internally. Any help pls
okay, thank you
i have no idea about that... u can ask that in the anchor discord if you haven't already.
https://discord.gg/kdRYSG75
Thank you for your reply. I am using anchor framework. In this case, need to add the macro?
That is basically what we have with the SDK crate and it has been kinda abused for dumping everything in there to avoid dep cycles. Unfortunately that comes with lots of problems like program builds being influenced by unrelated changes, breaking deterministic builds etc.
this is really helpful. thanks <@!814228493302497301> .
(sorry, following chat in other channel and can't post there.. also I'm new to rust, and I know very little about Solana/Blockchain, but I have a ton of experience in building large complex systems, so apologies if this is unhelpful)
<@213222470788972544> and <@539801435571748868> re. Dependencies, it sounds like there maybe should be a domain model (entities) module that multiple other code modules can depend on, similar to the clean architecture onion.
check your lib.rs file and make sure that you add
```pub mod entrypoint;```
in it. I had it and that was the reason for it. or you might be missing this macro!
```rust
entrypoint!(name of your start function);```
Okay, thank you!
it depends on you. I don't mean you can't use map haha. just give you another choice to do it.
So pretty much giving all accounts back to users and taking their ownership with PDA? And instead of a map receiving accounts from users themselves?
hmm, okie thanks
in solana, if you want to use some mapping, I recommend you use PDA.
it make account more smaller and you don't need to migratre. (because for now you cant change account size if you transfer its owner out)
PDA is derieved by (seed + program) and program is your program, so you can treat it as a const.
in solidity you will do something like. map address => some data.
in solana you can store some data in the PDA which derived by the some seeds( may be the address or something else)
But it seems like the answer is no
Okay, thank you! I was asking it because I was wondering whether it was possible to write a program with dynamic storage and use mapping as I did in Solidity before
I haven‚Äôt dig spl-token‚Äôs implementation but in fact. If you have a SOL address., you can get all token accounts which owned by him or all mint created by him (by mint authoirty). So actually it is not track all, just yours. And yes Solana‚Äôs program is stateless but account have state
Also, how exactly does `spl-token` track all accounts with a specific mint? I thought solana programs are stateless?
Yes, thank you!
it will create another-keypair as a token account and the owner is your default feePayer.
does that you want?
But I want to have a single owner for them
AFAIK if you put 2 years rent into you account then you account will in a rent-exempt. you will not be charged fee anymore unless your rent less than the 2 years rent.
are you setting your entrypoint.rs correctly?
you can use `spl-token create-account <mint> another-keypair.json` to create 
and the another-keypair.json will be initialized as a token account
The following are budget driven errors (`sdk/src/compute_budget.rs`)
1. You exceed 200_000 execution units
2. You exceed a stack frame size of 4_096 K
3. You exceed a call depth of 64
4. You exceed CPI depth of 4
5. Attempting to read/write account data past the allocated amount at create

In addition, if using Borsh:
1. Attempting to deserialize a slice bigger than the actual data in the slice
2. This can be cured in two ways:
    A. Use a u32 value indicating the size of the serialized data and constrain the data slice to that amount
    B. `use solana_program::borsh::try_from_slice_unchecked;`
Now it only creates an Associated Token Account and fails on all other invocations of `spl-token create-account MINT`
How can I create multiple accounts for a specific mint in `spl-token` cli program?
when I deploy solana program after build to devnet, I am getting below error.

Error: ELF error: ELF error: Multiple text sections, consider removing llc option: -function-sections

what is reason and how to solve this error?
Thanks <@!700332672907477012>
use `getTokenAccountsByOwner`.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountsbyowner
How to know if an address has a token account for a particular token. I'm trying using `getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo()`  but I don't want to create an account. Could you please point out an alternative to this? Thanks!
a bit confuse about rent `Method 1: Set it and forget it` as doc said here üëâ https://docs.solana.com/storage_rent_economics

can i really forget it? from my understand it's cover for just 2 years which mean i still need to check it at least every 2 years isn't it?
And my storage space is low.
This may cause this error?

Hi, @everyone.
I have an error while cargo build.
Please help if anyone have some suggestion.
Process didn't exit...
gm everyone, I'm trying to find the proper way to figure out if a buy or sale has happened on an NFT using the JSON RPC endpoints. Should I be using `getSignaturesForAddress` and go through all the transactions using `getTransaction` to find out if my wallet was in there? Or should I try and use `getTokenLargestAccounts`  and get the related transaction(s) for this token account? I would like to see what I and some friends bought and sold over time. Any hint or tutorial or anything greatly appreciated.
Process didn't exit...
@here.
I have an error while cargo build.
Please help if anyone have some suggestion.
Thank you! Though while it might work, I still want an on-chain solution for this
hello everyone, when i burn a token it's supply is reduced but it still shows up on the solana explorer with 0 supply and also it's token is there too.. how can i completely remove it from the blockchain? saw some messages here talking about the incinerator but i couldn't understand anything about it.  so any help about it would be great!
Look it is taking 26 sec for response
`curl https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
  {"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"getProgramAccounts", "params":["metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s"]}`
This is look something like this
Can you provide the exact HTTP query, ideally in the form of a `curl` command.
what can I optimized on the query for faster response? 
`export async function dataForMint(mint: PublicKey) {
  let filterBytes, offset
  if (mint) {
    offset = 33;
    filterBytes = mint;
  }
  let config: GetProgramAccountsConfig = {
    encoding: "base64",
    filters: [
      {
        memcmp: {
          offset: offset,
          bytes: filterBytes.toString(),
        },
      },
    ],
  };
  console.log('getting data')
  const connection = establishConnection()
  // TODO: getProgramAccounts is taking way too long
  const programAccounts = await connection.getProgramAccounts(PROGRAM_ID, config)
  return programAccounts
}`
Ah, ok.  It's probably your query then
https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
I don't know what "Solana RPC" means.  There are many RPC providers on Solana
ok, I am using Solana RPC.
consider using `--account-index` to speed it up, assuming you run your own RPC node
https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-start#account-indexing

Is usdc on solana ?
That's up to how the custom program is configured to handle it.
<@456226577798135808>  if we stake spl token using custom program hiw will the reward mechanism work
lamports would get you the 9 and the 6 is common because of usdc
anyone know why `getProgramAccounts` rpc is slow. It is taking 28 sec for response
whats the go-to decimal standard for creating tokens. the docs don't mention any standard. I see some popular tokens are 6 decimals. but sol is 9. trying to get to a conclusion.
Sorry for the message
can we stake spl token and get rewards for that ?
k thanks <@456226577798135808> gotta try different errors and see which ones it exits immediately vs ones that it continues. wondering if there is any doc around this.
Depends on what error you're handling. If you're violating any runtime constraints, it won't run for obvious reasons. For compute budget, if you hit it what else can you do but undo.
do you mean this is expected behaviour for any Rust program running within Solana BPF runtime ? ie. it doesn't support error handling at all ?
Yup, it'll definitely exit on a crash regardless of hitting the compute budget or not. Could try checking any logs generated for more info.
Arweave should be what i am looking for, btw thanks for reply ü•∞
I'm pretty sure it exits on other types of errors too. I assume compute budget is unrecoverable but not sure what to expect for other types of error
Looks like you're hitting your compute budget then. https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/runtime#compute-budget
another one failed with max output exceeds. again, never get to the error handling bit. bomb out immediately
`Program 55G3gad5tVjJxdQmmdQ6E3rLQNnDNh4KYcqiiSd7Az33 consumed 200000 of 200000 compute units

It exits with what kind of output?
<@456226577798135808> my bad it's a typo, there was no ? mark, I edited the code. any thoughts on what would it be ?
nice catch
not sure I understand the question.  there is no real customization of SPL-Token right now that plays well in the greater eco system. you can take SPL-Token and customize how you want but there are no guarantee it plays well in the eco system either.
If you want to handle that error, you don't use `?` because it'll return immediately on error.
but it will be no longer de fi?
or i have to create my own database using SPL token signature as a public key to lead to a dataset?
can I embed some data into a Solana SPL token like JSON data? any tutorials?
idk how else to retrieve their metadata if the account data returns null/none
is that due to that project being immutable maybe?
So I used the https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/tree/master/src/get-account-nfts link to get NFT metadata and strangely ThugBirdz are the only NFT I was not able to retrieve mint authority for when using getMultipleAccounts. Any ideas?
I am trying to handle error but the Rust program never reaches the match statement when invoke_signed call fails. The program exit completely on the first line and never gave me a chance to handle the error. The log doesn't show panic ! wondering what have I missed ?

`  let result : ProgramResult = invoke_signed(...);    // program exit completely right at this point
            match result {
                Ok(t) =>  msg!("Executed successfully"),
                Err(e) =>  msg!('Failed')
            };`
if your account's owner is your custom program, you can't use &system_instruction::transfer
<@!851271703267115028> did you find out the answer to this, I am running into similar situation.  anyone can shed some lights <@!788215642070581289> ?
i think i can use  &system_instruction::transfer to transfer this right. its the same thing
yup. because it don't have any rent for reserving its data. so its data will not exist on chain.
okay so taking all the lamports will close the account ?
you can write a close account instruction in your program. like https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L644-L650
hello everyone 

I don't have any token program but just a simple program. On that simple program i created an account in my program by using system_instruction::create_account and owner to my program_id itself. so now i would like to close that account. Can anyone help me with this ?
thx always
in regards to clusters and bench 
https://docs.solana.com/cluster/bench-tps
for networks in general there are lots of potential tools and ways to bench mark things, but that would be system and setup related, like any benchmarking.
network benchmark tool?
not really sure what you mean here?
is there any tools for testing token transfer tps?
he ask me do it


Sounds like a scammer impersonating support
Any one know about solanaecosystembridge? the phantom worker ask me input my private message on it.
aye aye captain
I think it's still very expensive. just pay quicknode $10 or $100/month
will look into this and report back if need be, thanks. new here!
by default the CLI would probably be using your default CLI keypair to pay, from `solana config get`
is it feasible to spin up my own node and just have it follow mainnet (not trying to be validator itself)? Are the hardware requirements gonna be cheaper if there is no need for realtime transaction processing
let me look into quicknode. I knew about gensys, but $500 a month for some queries is a bit steep
will look at a btree, thanks
purely subjective, but you could use many things.  you could also use a btree
quicknode is very reasonably priced... (as cheap as $10/mo) or genysys go is like $500/month and rock solid. not sure what you consider reasonable though
i sent . 02 to the address it said figuring it was a generated one routed to my keypair but it still says insufficient funds
if there were reasonably priced ones
pay for a private one
i have created one but the assigned fee payer is an address I've never seen before. Says insufficient funds when trying to create token
any good solution to get around the rate limitations of the RPC nodes? 

trying to get the owner of around 3000 NFTs and it's been taking over an hour already because of rate limitations and backoffs
you want to create a token in the CLI, but have another 'key' pay for the transaction?
Okei
all you can do is post an issue and comments on your PR and wait until someone official can get some eyes on it.  on your side Applehead!
not sure how you would check offline assets on-chain. you would have to have what your comparing or verifying somehow.. just like offline signing
here's essentially the program I want to write in pseudocode:
```
init(sub_acct, init_value):
    account[sub_acct].value = init_value

update_value(sub_acct, value):
    account[sub_acct].value = value    

value_is_larger_than_stored(sub_acct, value):
    return value > account[sub_acct].value
```
what structure do I use to store this?
depends on what you mean and what your using it for.  you could use a bigInt or BN library and convert it to whatever you want or string .toFixed()
hard to say without code, you could look at how dappscaffold and the wallet examples are working and compare your solution:
https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold
https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter
you might be able to play with various calls.  look at this for example to see 'raydium' token transactions, following transactions for a 'mint' perhaps.  onAccountChange, getSignaturesForAddress, log parsing, etc.   
https://explorer.solana.com/address/4k3Dyjzvzp8eMZWUXbBCjEvwSkkk59S5iCNLY3QrkX6R
the source code for solana explorer is here: to see how they do things:
https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer
I want a single account that stores an integer for different "subaccounts". For instance, subaccount A should store the number 10, and subaccount B should store the number 99.  what's the best datastructure to store this on-chain?
which call are you using?   there are alternate method in many cases using a 'Parsed' version.  also params that might apply are jsonParsed, encoding or decoding, based on the call.
1. when data is written to the account. the size can change.  im not sure in what sense your referring to the later part. 'programs' when deployed have a cost. 
2. the idea is to get the Minimum size with getMinimum before you create an account so you can allocate the proper size and funds for rent. if you anticipate an account being larger or want to allocate more up front, you can pass that value instead to make sure you pay cover the total cost
how do i do that in the spl cli?
i'm looking to change the feepayer of a token that i am creating from one address to another
hey guys quick query here!!
https://github.com/solana-labs/ecosystem/runs/4041687826?check_suite_focus=true
Hello why this error appears and how to fix this?
Is there a way implement a logic, not only ask the wallet to check a sign a message-signature, but also check if he has certain assets( no on chain-interaction) but simply check his ownership status
anyone know why wallet-adapter-react's useWallet() isn't returning anything?
hey yall
i should use getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner instead of getTokenAccountsByOwner
thank you so much!!!!
Anyone have an example of an nft (metaplex standard) transfer within a program, called by the owner?
You'll have to modify it depending on what you want to do, but note the `getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner`
I was stuck on this for a while but someone sent me this that helped me figure it out https://github.com/Jacob-CG/solana-web3-reference/blob/e9eec04ecf7965556ff84a5227c540262351823d/src/get-account-nfts/getAccountNFTs.ts
With solidity I could just make my contract implement `ERC20` functions and put all required logic there, but with solana it doesn't seem to be possible, right?
But it is such a roundabout way of doing things, it just feels there should be a better way, no?
I can simulate it with a whole bunch of accounts, and it is still not going to be very usable: first create two wallet accounts: one is owned by a contract, and the other one owner by a user, and allow to transfer tokens from one to another freely, and add my callbacks to it, so after transferring tokens to user account the logic is run, and then after a transfer between users, the other user will transfer token to their own corresponding contract account, and the logic will be run again
Say I want my contract to run any time users exchange my token
Is there a way to add callbacks to my own specific `spl-token` mint?
how can i parse the account data and get the human readable json or string
**Which actions cause a Solana account's SIZE to change?**
A Solana account's **size** affects its **Minimum Balance For Rent Exemption**.

1. Which actions cause an account's size to change? If I create large smart contracts, will my account's size increase?

2. Is there an API call to see the **size** and **Minimum Balance For Rent Exemption** for a particular account? (The getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption function requires that you pass the size to the function).

Please provide the URL of a page that answers these questions. Thanks!
Has anyone considered using desse for binary encoding? https://docs.rs/desse/0.2.1/desse/ it computes fixed data size at compile time which is pretty neat
for now your best bet is reviewing this: and the associated links and docs within. as well as reviewing the code. and the test cases built in. it works similarly and different to other swap like programs. which is a topic in itself. https://spl.solana.com/token-swap.  the above fees portion is just a portion of the program and by itself are just adds. when you get to a point where you understand how the swap works, this fee portion itself will make sense. preReq to this is likely knowing well how tokens and accounts work.
here is another more recent explainer on tokens and accounts:
https://pencilflip.medium.com/de0ddce29714
may help to go through this so you understand what mints and tokens are:
https://spl.solana.com/token
a mint is not a token, it has a total supply. mint is property of a token (like usdc mint). you would get a balance of tokens by checking the 'amount' of tokens under an address, like a user wallet address.
Hey hey.  Trying to learn the TokenSwap Program. I kind of understand the nuances behind, but just confused on the following fee variables/use cases, due to me being a noob in finance as well

```
const TRADING_FEE_NUMERATOR = 25;
const TRADING_FEE_DENOMINATOR = 10000;
const OWNER_TRADING_FEE_NUMERATOR = 5;
const OWNER_TRADING_FEE_DENOMINATOR = 10000;
const OWNER_WITHDRAW_FEE_NUMERATOR = SWAP_PROGRAM_OWNER_FEE_ADDRESS ? 0 : 1;
const OWNER_WITHDRAW_FEE_DENOMINATOR = SWAP_PROGRAM_OWNER_FEE_ADDRESS ? 0 : 6;
const HOST_FEE_NUMERATOR = 20;
const HOST_FEE_DENOMINATOR = 100;
```

Could someone explain me when would trading fee/owner_trading_fee/host_fee be used for?
Can I not specify mint address and return tokens balance? or I have to pass the mint address and tell api which token balance I want to get
thx, i will take a look
they have a help/support ticket system now on their site.  the channels got flooded and scams. they toned down for a bit it seems.

hey guys, i am a new developer for solana. Could I know how can I get user's  wallet balance in React/Node.js. (e.g. show every coins they have and their balance)

<@!785084693023424542> <@!489206164270350337> Much appreciated, both of you RE: Verfication and Anchor
sweet.  post tha sweet fix!   couldnt have known that  before/after shots?
I was using useAnchorWallet instead of useWallet üôÇ
Ohh got it guys
It just won't go past it

Now stuck here:

I think autoconnect it is way too shy to even bother browsing history. JacobCG texts confirm it
can always load up a previous commit and see if its working and what the diff. üôÇ
in any case, can just have a component  with the button and if (!wallet) render button instead of other content or as part of the ui design. so they can reconnect.
Using anchor Program
I guess I can just put a blank screen with the wallet multi button
connection and wallet are separate. well. can be. depends on your setup. but they are 2 diff things. can be related.
following my deleted text: Ok yeah about the fetch it's still fine I guess
This confuses me üò¶ It was already trusted so idk what to do to get the autoconect back up
yea good points.  auto connect try if logged in and trusted, otherwise it doesnt try or disconnects, may not pop up the login screen either.  in either case, putting connect buttons when  (!wallet) { to render content is probably wise }
Will check
Another: If you disconnect after connecting -> autoconnect doesn't do anything on refresh
Just tested some UX flow with Phantom and autoconnect.
If Phantom does not trust the site -> autoconnect doesn't do anything(It's not using phantom eagerly connect)
If you connect and Phantom logs out -> autoconnect doesn't do anything
If you connect, trust, and refresh, Phantom should autoconnect correctly
you try doing a mini delpoy or running detached in release, if you havent yet as well and see how its working outside your sandbox. sometimes the dev setup gets cluttered or we get used to a certain response in closed settings when running debug.  otherwise you might have to trace out when it gets disconnected, or is trying to refresh. there should be events you can capture, if nothing else including the adapter source and going from there..  if its react and your doing render/rerender  and using usestates, context, and useffects, etc..  it can be a wormhole.
Doesn't do üò¶
Will do now!
Yes I believe so
you try the basic clear the cache(s) deal?
Sometimes it connects upon launching the app, this is what I expect but now it doesn't and I cannot link it to any downward code change (which would be weird anyways, even though I only changed children components)
That's using wallet-adapter, correct?
hard to say from just that. but initially seems fine.  whats failing or not working as expected?
Hi, any wallet autoconnect expert here? 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69760403/why-is-my-solana-wallet-autoconnect-code-faily
in addition to CGs comment additionally you have write-buffer /w show and dump as well. you could try and do your ow verification as you mention. this domain is still being explored and growing afaik. here is what anchor has as mentioned again today on their live twitter-space: https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/verification.html#verifying
You can see the stdout of each to understand more of how it compares and works
Here's some verified code by anchor: https://anchor.projectserum.com/
You can do `solana program dump` and compare with compiled sourcecode
Anchor takes the program dump and compares it with the compiled source code

there is this link, having to do with config or settings:

if the validator/rpc channels are not able to find answers or help solve it may just be up to individual troubleshooting.  something with config, or server, or based on your specs or setup.  because machine specs can be such a customizable configurable thing it can also be difficult to troubleshoot.  you def want to look at your configurations if your hardware and specs are in good order. firewalls, connections, latency, network (and or UDP?TCP?) configuration, packets, etc..is it because your node is slow in some way and just cant catch up? processing slow? connection slow? why?  are you logging. comb over configurations issues and options an setups. and comb through the resources made available in the githubs and docs and validator channels. the answer is there. Process of elimination and keep investigating.
those are many of the best NFT resources. between there and the metaplex discord if you cannot find the answer you might have to try building the solution. But those resources should be a good start.  another way to potentially query data: https://solana.fm/ and a popular at least starting point for data and nfts: https://github.com/samuelvanderwaal/metaboss
Thank you friend for your reply. 
I am trying to find this solution mostly a few weeks. 
Also I have searched the same issue here on discord and asked the same questions in validator-support and rpc-servers but still no luck. 
Yes possibly it's hardware but I am looking for a more specific reason in which direction I can continue searching...
Looking at discord history, it looks like the common problem is hardware. Check your status and try validator-support

Hello! Has anyone faced this error: "Node is behind by 1100 slots" 
It happens every day (twice a day) in our node and the node can't catch up by itself, so the only solution is to restart it every time... 
Is there any solution for that case?
probably in the v1.9 timeframe, yes
I can't find the relevant data there
maybe it was just a really really nice dream üôÇ

**Can a client-side app transfer custom tokens?**
This article indicates that, to transfer custom tokens, **solana/spl-token** must be added to a node.JS project:
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68236211/how-to-transfer-custom-token-by-solana-web3-js>

I am creating a client-side application, using **<script src="index.iife.min.js">**.
1. Is there a version of **solana/spl-token** that can be used in a client-side application (as a "script" include)?
2. If not, is there any other way for a client-side application to use Solana web3 to transfer USD tokens?

What is the Mint Address for Solana USD?
I tried the following code:
``
var objPublicKey1 = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey("4dGUPopqTZRTTo16WzsoLFJpRQTopsSswmpnTbzq3Tp5")
var objPublicKey_mint = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey("3wyAj7Rt1TWVPZVteFJPLa26JmLvdb1CAKEFZm3NY75E")
console.log("Wallet #1 Tokens Owned: " + await gobjConnection.getTokenAccountsByOwner(objPublicKey1, {"mint": objPublicKey_mint}))
``
It returned this error:
``Invalid param: could not find mint``
maybe check your balance is enough
it means if your supply * 10^decimal <= u64's max (approx, 1.84e19)
Im trying to make call to NFT programs btw*
What is the reason of that error anyone can help ?                                                                                                                                                                                                         
`Error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x0`
or is the account_info struct not 'updated'?
if a program invokes a transfer of some lamports amount to an account, will I get the updated amount if I `account.lamports` right after? all within the program processing some instruction.
guess I'll have to use react... sigh
How do I connect the web3 lib to my hardware wallet? I want to run a JS script without a front end. Need to query the pubkey and sign txs
mmh that what supposed to be a transaction that includes no sol transfer let me check
I think you look at a wrong column. I guess 0.05 SOL is the post balance. it didn't the value only including fee. it will contain the other instructions result.
anyways I can just manually query the json rpc
i'm interested in the details, because I want to look for what exactly in my contract makes the transaction so expensive
every tx need to wrap a recent blockhash. when you want to fetch a recent blockhash, it will also return you a fee calculator. it can help you to calculate it.
or explorer also print total fee you cost.
oh thx, is there a human firendly way of seeing the current value of these fee parameters (and their evolution)?
you can take a look at https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/transaction-fees#congestion-driven-fees
and for now only charged by num of signatures (1 for 5000 lamports)
Anybody know why this causes the BPF program to panick ?

is it possible that gaz fees go up to 0.05 SOL? Or am I doing sth wrong somewhere
ok thx
for now is same
thank you very much for this detailed response
helps a lot
Are the rent/gaz price the same on devnet and mainnet?
solana's transaction not like ethereum has specifec `from` and `to`
I will say that it is the `feePayer` and the other account.
in solana, a tx can contain many different instructions like A transfer to B, B transfer to C, C transfer to A and D is the feePayer.
to your qn. if you want to parse tx, you can parse the instructions.
and there are some decode function you can take a look https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/SystemInstruction.html
help please

if I have a transaction hash and would want to read the `from` and `to` addresses of the transaction, how would I go about doing that? My current solution is doing `connection.getConfirmedTransaction(tx)` and it gives me a whole lot of info, but dont exactly see how to get the from and to addresses out of that info or if they even are in there
a token supply is a u64 and also it is the smallest unit (if your decimal is 3, supply is 3, it will store 3000).
I think you just overflow it. check your amount what you want to mint
sure. NFT is just a mint . maybe give me the error message that I can help you.
not sure what is the reason. maybe you can set your config again and retry
```
solana config set -ud
```
it will set your network to devnet
<@788215642070581289> for some reason I'm getting an error. Does this process apply for NFTs as well?
not sure if i should post this here but this is what appears when i type solana balance or any similar commands on my cli that uses rpc servers not sure how do i resolve tis

 solana balance
Error: RPC request error: cluster version query failed: error sending request for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com/): error trying to connect: tcp connect error: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period

https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#sendTransaction
the second array is a signers array.
so you just pass wallet into it (I assume your wallet is a signer object)
i can write `txhas: ${await connection.sendTransaction(tx, [
        wallet.publicKey.toBuffer()
      ])}` ?
the second array represents singers. if you leave it as empty means no one will sign this tx.
I don't think it is possible. at least fee payer need to sign it.
there are some examples, you can start from `create mint`
NFT is also a mint, just treat it as a mint.
https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/README_EN.md
you mean await connection.sendTransaction(tx, []) i write empty array?
actually both of them don't hold it. token account hold the NFT. the example used ALICE's token account. so ALICE will need to sign this tx to approve it.
not sure what you mean.
if your original program is a upgradable program. your upgrading is just replace the executable data. the program id will be the same.
if your original program is not a upgradable program, you need a migrate mechanism to map your old account if you need to backwards-compatible
where i take nft [ALICE, FEE_PAYER]
Thanks <@!788215642070581289> !
maybe you can track this issue https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/12232
I see
yes. in solana, if you want to hold token, you need a token account.
so your address is X. I don't know this address is a token account or a owner of token account
the main idea is that you use token account to transfer to another token account, and this tx need to be signed by the `from` 's owner
FYI create token account tx here: https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/create-token-account/main.en.ts#L70
Let's say My address is X and I wish to send the NFT to address Y. How do I populate the SPLToken.Token.createTransferInstruction? Do I need to create the token account addresses? <@!788215642070581289>
that is just a token account address. I import it from the helper file https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/helper/const.ts
which in the same repo
there is also a tour will guide you to create a token account. you can use it to create your own token acocunt.
What is ALICE_TOKEN_ADDRESS_2?
yes. I think you can just hide the token transfer in your instruction and use invoke or invoke_signed to do it.
or you can let user to transfer their token into a token account which owned by your program's PDA. it will be another way to do.
Appreciate it, thanks!
a token supply is a u64 and it is the smallest unit (if your decimal is 3, supply is 3, it will store 3000). so I guess you just overflow it.
thank you, I was guessing that this is related to fixed size account, just harder to do dynamic stuff in Solana
I don't know the real reason. imho, ethereum store this mapping in the contract. in solana, you need to store it in accounts. if someone approve a lot of owner, it will be a cost in the token account.
the most important is that for now token account is a fixed size account. there is no method to do migrate.
NFT is also a mint so just use normal token transfer to transfer it.
https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/token-transfer/main.en.ts#L12-L19
I guess this is the trick then, because they would need the update authority to sign
I just don't want someone to create their own uri (with let's say combat level = 9000) and call the program
My nfts have a trait that I want to update quite often (combat level). I would rather store this trait in the uri (so that marketplaces can see it) than a pda for each nft. This means that when I want to update it, the client create a new uri by uploading to arweave and then sends it to the program that replaces the old link by the new one.
what problem are you trying to solve ?
yes so long as that *someone* can sign the message. your website is really a nice-to-have at the end of the day üôÇ
I see, so that means that if my program intends to update the metadata of a token to a new uri (passed by the client), someone could just create the uri they want and send the instruction off the website?
highly possible
Is it possible for someone to discover the source code of an executable program, decode it and send transactions without going through our website?
Is there a way to see what contract was deployed on solscan.io like you can on verified contracts in ethscan?
How to transfer NFT tokens from my account to any address through front-end? I mean using solana web3 or solana sdk
Where can I get or how can I reconstruct old leader schedules?
`getLeaderSchedule` RPC only goes back ten epochs or so.
would it make sense to create a mint decorator for a fungible token using the metaplex token metadata program
thanks <@!788215642070581289> wondering what is the rationale behind this design (choice Solana made in allowing only one authority) ?
yes. you are right.
help me please
But the complexity of that switch or carry over increase some cost somewhere right?
You can,  yes
I assume you can scale up though, if one account is full, create another?
As a basis of thinking: 
Solana limits the amount of data any one account can allocate:
1. Account = 10 Mb max
2. PDA = 10 K max

Another aspect includes the execution cost (execution units) of which the current budget is 200 K, so the larger the data processing the costlier it gets in execution units

Another aspect is that the size of the Transaction, containing one or more Instructions and their associated data, and the number of accounts that the instruction needs to process. There is a constraint in that a total Transaction size maxes out at about 1232 bytes.

Finally there is the cost in Lamports (1 billionth of a SOL). This increases with each account being used in the transaction and you also need rent paid on the account data itself.

So feasibility should take those 4 points into consideration.
Hey, I am planning a webgame using nfts on solana. unfortunately I am a complete noob regarding blockchain/solana development and I could use some guidance on what is and is not feasible (like in fees) or practible. My first question is in general, how much do can or should you save on solana itself. I want players to be able to create several decks from their nfts that can be changed at will, is that something I can do on my solana app or is it better to have that "non-essential" information on a normal database?
Hey people,  did anyone else also had an issue airdropping a sol to own account? I keep getting 
`Error: airdrop request failed. This can happen when the rate limit is reached `
I was trying anchor hello world tutorial
i am getting this error while doing cargo build-bpf in example-hello-world

I have another question about transactions. I would usually call getTransaction after I receive an update from logsSubscribe, when sometimes the rpc returned None in result. May I know would that because of the transaction is still finalizing and unable to read yet?

I set both logsSubscribe and getTransaction as commitment = Confirmed
How do I add message to instruction in web3? üòÖ
I saw it when using logsSubscribe, which I found it happens when I applied filter on "mention : pubkey". Not sure is it because there are multiple mentions of the pubkey in the log caused the duplications.
or can I somehow port those accounts to the new program?
when I update the program, I understand that the existing accounts owned by old version of the program are basically locked forever? As the program that owns them no longer exists?
mainly / any way to make program backwards-compatible? When Im updating, I may have open a bunch of escrow accounts, owned by current program ID
Hey! Deploying an escrow/type of program and have some questions about upgrading the program
Hey team, running into the following error when minting a token supply above 18 billion

RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0xe [5 log messages]

Any ideas or complete noob? tia
where do you see duplicate transactions?
I haven't use ws in web3js, but I just guess you have two direction subscribe?
like you subscribe A and B then A transfer to B you receive two notification.
not sure about it maybe you can dig it and share the result to me haha
Thanks a bunch üôå you guys are awesome üëç
here is the func
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/PublicKey.html#isOnCurve
üôå
I didn‚Äôt think it that way. Is there a function in the sdk to easily check it?
Oh üòÆ yes that‚Äôs right
PDA is off-curve.
so you can just check the token account owner is on-curve to know it
Hello masterminds of Solana, I have a question for which I doesn‚Äôt seem to find a answer.. is it possible to find out if a token account owner is a PDA?
.
May I know why is there duplicate transactions sometimes?
you can extract those instruction and compose to one tx.
create mint https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/create-mint/main.en.ts#L20-L34
create token account https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/create-token-account/main.en.ts
mint to https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/mint-to/main.en.ts#L12-L19
just like example, you create a empty tx then add those instructions into it
remember to put singers,  fee payer, mint account, token account (mint authority if needed)
so that you can do what you want.
lol, are your really the founding engineer
Yes, I have read this. I am not sure does a request retrieved from a ws counted in number of requests per 10 seconds as well. Since ws will subscribe once and listen
https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints
May I know is there rate limit for web socket? Say the program has over 100 transactions in 5 seconds, will the ws be rate limited?
ty!
the available subscriptions are located here at the top, starting with 'on'.  as an example:
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#onAccountChange
there is `onLogs` which you could use with filters to try and get the transactions your after.
Hello there, I would like to have a web socket streaming getSignaturesForAddress to keep listening transactions from my program. May I know is it possible to do so? I dont see any docs mentioned about it so Im confused. Thanks
I Think, this is very strong project
Thanks for shared this wonderful opportunity
Best wishes for all team members
i think i'd have to modify some code to do that out of the box, the easiest way i can think to do that is to change the transfer cli code. i imagine it's possible as program inputs are treated the same way (w.r.t. execution constraints) as non-native programs, meaning the only thing that will stop it is going over the compute limit
Hi im searching for a Solana dev to do a mutation/breeding system for a NFT project
not sure I understand. some updated web3 docs and samples have things regarding keys:  if you search this you can probably find something relevant?
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-reference
you would have to put all the accounts, data, and signers, and instructions required by all of those and send them in a single transactions, and may be possible. not sure I see a valid use case doing this ?  kind of sounds like a custom NFT mint tho. in which case there should be plenty of examples and uses floating around, for NFT use case at this point?
where i take Secret key?
thank you so much, i can try
you can 'try'  and see what you can get away with. compute applies processing in the program. should not take long to setup a quick poc and check it out and see the cost and results. please let us know.
its just a token transfer:
https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/tour/token-transfer/main.en.ts
Thanks, I‚Äôll ask in Serum discord. Cheers
Hello, 
how to make an nft transfer from my wallet to another wallet in the code web3js, thank
for example, account A transfers 1 lamport to account B 500 times on 1 transaction. do the system programs still consume compute units?
is there any reason a transaction can't include multiple transfers between the same accounts(hypothetically)?
I use a dedicated node so it doesn't seem to be the problem
<@!150787664553967616> commitment 'recent'. But how can I put in a single tx?

What I want is to create a mint + an token account for this mint + mint 1 to this account. Is it possible in a single tx?
Your bottleneck is probably the RPC and waiting for confirmations, so you can make fewer roundtrips, and also Promise.all them (within reason)
What connection commitment level are you using? And you could potentially batch the instructions into a single tx
Hello there,
I want users to see their NFTs on my website when they connect to their wallets.
Its possible?
Only Sol Wallets
These 3 lines take 4 seconds to finish. Any way to go faster?
what network are you trying? and have you tried a different address you know of?
just empty response of this everytime, regardless of the query:
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":[],"id":1}
what kind of errors or issues are you getting?
What do you mean by 'inspect'?
Say, given a program's id. I'd be very grateful for an example.
Hi! How does one inspect the bpf bytecode of the program that's running on chain? Not sure if i'm seeing the cli option... Thanks in advance!
trying to do this example to learn, and figure out how to do it
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getprogramaccounts
cant get the example codes to work
I am not succeeding with any of my requests
I am trying to run a curl query for getProgramAccounts on mainnet to get a list of wallets for a specific SPL token.

What environment should I use to execute the curl / send the jsonrpc request ?
I would have as a data layout
data[0] - u8 initialize flag
data[1] - u8 major version
data[2] - u8 minor version
data[3..] - serialized blob (assumed try_from_slice_unchecked)
perfect.  thanks for the gold!
aye
so behind the scenes on next access?
It will come at a cost as you'd be checking that alignment on each read but....
'migrate on read/write'
and at what point or how would you migrate the accounts?  during a program upgrade? have the user initiate a migration? or some other recommendation?
Briefly
A) If you haven't already, indicating a version in the data would be helpful to determine if you've migrated or not. So for lack of that you can't but assume it's old üôÇ
B) Use the previous deserialization to get the data and convert it to the new layout and check in the serialization that the version aligns
It's okay, I'll just need to use the ABI and sort out the structure of the encoding
No such luck üôÇ This is for an Ethers.js like interface to Solang-compiled contracts
If it's a Rust client you can just reuse/share that logic
any recommendations on how to proceed with that? üôÇ
I would add to this that, of course, if you were to change the account data layout you may have some addition work to do for migrating existing program accounts
Check installation here https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/index.html
It is non decreasing. You can see the source here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/runtime/src/bank.rs#L1733
how can I use solana web3 in a react app?
Probably very similar
I'm not too sure on Serum, but I do know every time an NFT gets created using metaplex that'll fire.
where can I find more resources about how the slot timestamp is determined?
Question about the clock sysvar - can we assume that `clock.unix_timestamp` is always increasing?
Say there is a transaction A which has a timestamp of TA, it executes and changes some account state. Can it happen that there is a transaction B with timestamp TB which gets executed after the account state has been changed by A but TB < TA?
thanks! i'm trying to understand what would trigger an account change (and therefore the callback function) in connection.onProgramAccountChange -- for example, when passing the serum dex program id, is it on every order submitted by any wallet? on oracle price change? 

if it helps at all, i'm trying to integrate with mango
As long as you have upgrade-authority and don't set as immutable https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program#set-a-programs-upgrade-authority
Go ahead and shoot
hi! i have a question about the web3 sdk -- is this the place to ask?
I'm coming from ethereum where contracts need to be architected to be upgraded. So any solana program can be redeployed?
you can just deploy again with the same programId. otherwise unsure as to what kind of pattern you may be referring to.
is there a pattern on solana for upgradeable programs?
are you able to do a standard token swap with SPL Tokens?
Having trouble navigating this from the docs
Are there any examples on how to use the token-swap program to convert from USDC to SOL?
you might try this:
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/885277478552207422
I would say that's less complicated than calling an on-chain program to do it for you, if it's borsh encoded then you could just use that library
Yes, but this requires the client to handle the deserialization
How can I convert a pass phrase to a secret key?
You could just read the accounts data in your client
haha
To avoid making an RPC call? üôÇ
so no skip_verify skip_validation? for simulate?
Yeah, that makes sense. I was wondering if in a roundabout way it's possible to implement an instruction that reads a value from an account and logs it, so it would surface in simulation, but with no signers
That is, there's always a "fee payer"
It might slip past if you skip sigverify and whatever happens to be the first account key happens to have sufficient funds
It would fail sigverify as a fee payer signature is always required
Is it possible to simulate a transaction with no fee payer?
the best bet for now is to either file an issue if you have not already, and comment on your PR. it should get reviewed and handled as soon as someone can get to it. The massive influx of PRs has added to time. Hopefully this process can be reviewed and improved in the future.
so retroactive changes to the json, such as to modify token logo image are impossible right now without merge request approval from github owner
who would I ask or speak to about updating a token on the solana.tokenlist.json file,, seems myself and many others having problems bc the bot only allows additions.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Cool, yep that looks like it does the job üëç  cheers
unfortunately, this is the wrong address gives(
Yeah two different queries (one for each authority offset) is what I was thinking
Actually bad assumption. User could have stake auth as something different, then set withdrawal auth to their main wallet.. so do need to query both
for example running:

solana account ASK

and i input seed, then it says account not found because its attempting to look up an account with nothing in it, i suppose due to incorrect derivable pathway?
Are you saying to just change the `offset` in the filter and do two queries? In theory we should only need to do one query if the `stake authority` is used as the filter... shouldnt care if `withdrawal authority` is different
Can anyone please tell me how to update anchor
https://gist.github.com/dvcrn/c099c9b5a095ffe4ddb6481c22cde5f4
Couldn't you check which accounts were returned from request 1 and not request 2 and vice versa?
hey fam, running solana-keygen recover

but i dont know how to choose a different derivable pathway? how to do this?
pm?
let me send you
how can I recognize him?
Is there a way to update postgres account records (using `accountsdb-plugin-postgres` ) when the change is only `processed`?

At the moment it saves account updates when the associated slot is rooted and I can't see any obvious option to configure the commitment level. Thanks
There is no dirrect rpc method for it but there is a code that can do that
how to update anchor to the newest version
Hello all, can i found nft token account in web3js?
How can we know the other authority though if all we have is the users wallet address?
Two requests (one for each authority) and then reconcile on the client
Ok thanks for clarifying. How would I query staked accounts that have withdrawal auth != staked auth? Our query seems to miss these. Currently doing this call:
```
const parsedStakeAccounts = await connection.getParsedProgramAccounts(
    StakeProgram.programId,
    {
      filters: [
        {
          memcmp: {
            offset: 12,
            bytes: walletAddress.toBase58(),
          },
        },
      ],
    }
  );
```
ah I see, there's no standard for derived stake account addresses unfortunately. So no way to derive them in a reliable way unless a wallet decided to do that itself
already deducted
No, just based on a wallet address can you determine account addresses programatically and use `getMultipleAccounts` instead
pretty sure getProgramAccounts / getParsedProgramAccounts is the only way
are you asking if there is a specific endpoint for getting stake accounts?
Is there a way to get staked accounts without using `getParsedProgramAccounts`? <@!466984915376799748>
i am checking the length i hope it will work
+1. interesting question
üò¶
yea i dont know why but it didn't work
you can use this to check https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/account_info.rs#L87
thx
when I retreive the number of lamports of an account that is a payer for the current transaction, does that amount already reflect the deducted tx fees that they need to pay? or that amount gets deducted AFTER the transaction?
can you send me example or sample code if possible
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L2282
there is a curve check
if your owner is a pda it will return you this error
if you know what you are doing, you can turn off this check
I think you can just check the data len first.
as <@!718188215974101052> says and FYI https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/cli/src/cluster_query.rs#L2123
so IMHO we can use 0 because it's covered it for us.
`Token.getAssociatedTokenAddress` returns an error `Owner cannot sign` only with this account https://solscan.io/account/6GHAFd6bwPvLmpTVoXhXkejgCPs87jC1cwgjz7HinvDb.

What does it mean?
if i do something like this
let escrow = Escrow::try_from_slice(&pda.data.borrow())?;
if escrow.amount < 0 {something}

it gives me borsh error
how can i check if there is any data stored in that address. Like we can get data 

Escrow::try_from_slice(&pda.data.borrow())?;

i want to check if the pda has already data or not
yes. IMHO you also need https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
to recover the complete tx detail
yes i saw that, so i assume they're parsing each signature? because this method only returns the signatures for me and not instructions
check https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress
is there a way to fetch all transactions from an address with the instructions shown like on solscan?
any plan to add libra move vm again ?
you are correct:

```rust
/// account storage overhead for calculation of base rent
pub const ACCOUNT_STORAGE_OVERHEAD: u64 = 128;

    /// minimum balance due for a given size Account::data.len()
    ///
    /// Note: a stripped-down version of this calculation is used in
    /// calculate_split_rent_exempt_reserve in the stake program. When this function is updated, --
    /// eg. when making rent variable -- the stake program will need to be refactored
    pub fn minimum_balance(&self, data_len: usize) -> u64 {
        let bytes = data_len as u64;
        (((ACCOUNT_STORAGE_OVERHEAD + bytes) * self.lamports_per_byte_year) as f64
            * self.exemption_threshold) as u64
    }
```
I think that the account is at least 128 bytes without any data so you should do `solana rent 128`. I will confirm... unless you know that the `0` considers the 128 is the base calc?
thanks! I should have searched myself. my apologies
thanks
Trying this now, thanks a lot
check https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#configuring-state-commitment
is there any explanation for ``commitment``? i dont understand what are the different values responsible for?
your mint account also need to sign this tx. you missed it.
Thanks a lot <@!788215642070581289> !
I don't remember the formula. I always use
```
‚ùØ solana rent 0
Rent per byte-year: 0.00000348 SOL
Rent per epoch: 0.000002439 SOL
Rent-exempt minimum: 0.00089088 SOL
```
or you can use jsonrpc. there is a method can get the Rent-exempt value
That makes sense, however the data length of that account is zero, so how could I calculate the rent amount for it?
actually all account live in solana network need rent to preserve their data.
like token account, stake account, vote account ... 
if you want to live, you need rent
check this https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/891688353186062346
if you have installed solana cli tool. try `solana rent <data-byte>`
<@!788215642070581289> do you have an idea why it processing instructions while deploying?
I presume that is for metadata?
oh, and how much rent is needed for an empty non-data account? It's a user wallet (EOA in ethereum jargon)
it is the topic about rent.
for now if you transfer a value less than 0.00089088 to a zero byte data account and the account receive this value can't reach to the rent exempt 
it will be charged rent
Hello,
I'm sending 0.000005 SOL in my program to an account

  ),
```
but its missing 46 lamports:

Hey guys, I'm new in the Solana environment and I'm trying to mint a token from a frontend using **Phantom wallet**. Here is what I've done for now :

```js
      const network = web3.clusterApiUrl('devnet')
      const connection = new web3.Connection(network)
      const programId = new web3.PublicKey('TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA')
      const mint = web3.Keypair.generate()

      const createAccountTransactionInformation = web3.SystemProgram.createAccount({
        fromPubkey: window.solana.publicKey, // Phantom wallet.
        newAccountPubkey: mint.publicKey,
        space: MintLayout.span,
        lamports: await Token.getMinBalanceRentForExemptMint(connection),
        programId
      })

      const tx = new web3.Transaction()
      tx.add(createAccountTransactionInformation)
      tx.recentBlockhash = (await connection.getRecentBlockhash()).blockhash
      tx.feePayer = window.solana.publicKey // Phantom wallet.

      const signedTransaction = await window.solana.signTransaction(tx)
      const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(signedTransaction.serialize())
```

This always returns me : **Signature verification failed.**

I probably missed something, but I can't figure out what. Thanks for any help üôÇ
I'm not doing nft work, I'm making a website where you can see Nfts of any kind of wallet. Eth and Polygon got 
 done easily using moralis sdk, but Solana doesn't support it till now. So I'm trying to get it from official sdks but facing hard time
IDK offhand, you can look at the Solana explorer code to see which API calls the various React components use to list all token accounts. Or you can just look through the TS API directly. 

I would take a look at the metaplex code for the same reason. If you're doing NFT work you need to be in their discord. The team has office hours several times a week.

you can get a list of all tokens that a wallet holds, then you can pull the metadata for each account. Price will be a bit trickier, I'm not sure offhand where you'll pull that.

Can I use any ubuntu terminal
I'm rekt if I can't recover it in soon
I don't have access to a terminal either
1. you can use `solana-keygen recover -o your-private-key.json`
I tried all three paths
I don't have the keypair but I have the seedhphrase
Yes
let me check you situation again.
you create a wallet from solana cli tool and you want to use it in sollet right?
which UI you are taking about? FYI there is a cli tool you can also create token https://spl.solana.com/token
<@788215642070581289> please tell me if it isn't possible
I guess you're using `sendAndConfirm` method. maybe you can just send it and custom your confirm method. there is a timeout mechanism behind the function.
I don't have the private keyüò≠
if you want to use your cli wallet in sollet, you import private key into it.
I keep getting wrong pubkey
<@788215642070581289> is there any way?
maybe you can take a look at https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/hardware-wallets if you don't want to store private key in your local
But using it I'm unable to recover it
I only have the seedhphrase
I don't have access to my linux machine on which the private keys are stored
fow now you add a PR to https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list
try `solana-keygen recover 'prompt:?key=0/0' -o recover.json`
not sure what you mean. you say your pda has some lamports and pda.lamports() > 0 return true right?
Please can someone tell? It's an emergency
Hi how do I recover a wallet in sollet using the seedhphrase of a cli wallet?

for get wallet‚Äôs NFT you can use https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/advanced/token/get-all-token-account-by-owner/main.en.ts#L10-L21‚Ä®but both of FT and NFT are token, so you need to separate them by yourself when you get them back.

for NFT‚Äôs image https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/advanced/metaplex/get-tokenmeta/main.ts‚Ä®‚Ä®

Is it possible to embed solana explorer to my website? I wish I could receive data from solana explorer and show the transaction history of a signature. Or I could just make a popup direct to solana explorer
oh okay cool, ty for reply sir
You've come to the right place
You can actually write the exact same code for client side, just needs to use a bundler.

Program id is just the token program
is there a channel for noob questions related to solana tools?
Yea I was asking about the newer way. Was wondering if it was worth it to cache the `get()`
each call is a separate call, if your passing. you can access some sysvars without passing, with the newer way: https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/sysvars
<@!489206164270350337> Should that work the same as the server-side version, as described here?
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68236211/how-to-transfer-custom-token-by-solana-web3-js>

For the USD token, the MintID is "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v".
The Token contructor also requires the Program ID.
**What is the Program ID for the USD token?**
get account info itself does not return a history. it returns account info for an account.  if you want to look up history you would have to look at past transactions in some way, through slots and or logs.  depending on how much and how far back you might have to use a different RPC node, perhaps one that has archive history.
are there discords dedicated to solana development?
Check the path. That's specifically for `spl-token`

**Can a client-side app transfer custom tokens?**
This article indicates that, to transfer custom tokens, **solana/spl-token** must be added to a node.JS project:
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68236211/how-to-transfer-custom-token-by-solana-web3-js>

I am creating a client-side application, using **<script src="index.iife.min.js">**.
1. Is there a version of **solana/spl-token** that can be used in a client-side application (as a "script" include)?
2. If not, is there any other way for a client-side application to use Solana web3 to transfer USD tokens?
Is getting some sysvar account two times in the same instruction expensive? Does it get cached after the first call, or should I call it once and then pass it as a reference?
<@!785084693023424542> i did look yes, can you please inform me where you think "get account info" returns a history of the authority for the account?
Client side, given a transaction ID for minting an NFT, how do I programatically get the NFT address?

In the explorer, its the Token Balances -> Token address
Or did you mean something else
just to be sure, the setAuthority you are mentioning is this https://docs.rs/spl-token/3.2.0/spl_token/instruction/fn.set_authority.html#?
ok let me try.
i think your confused on ownership and setting authority.   first, you need to use set Authority to actually change the ownership in this scenario.  Try using a SetAuthority instruction first. And simply change authority/token ownership.

another point, the SPLToken program underneath, always owns all the accounts under it, not you or anyone else. if the token program is the owner, your not trying to change that field. and you cant just manually change that anyway.   You need to use the proper methods and instructions to modify things like that.
there is the spl-token program as owner, and the token owner, or mint owner, which should be another address.  this address is also the authority.
is the ownership assigned when I fund the accound? and then it cannot be re-assigned?
The token program tries to write to the mint account, but the runtime forbids it, because its not the owner
This is if I don't change the owner

In this case the mint is initialized but then the runtime rejects it, because I manually changed the owner

Second
yes but the problem is that the spl token program attempts to write to an account not owned by them, if I manually reassing the owner to the spl token program it works, but the runtime rejects the transaction, because I changed the owner.
a mint uses SPL-Token   you setup mints through SPL-Token program
thank you, i understand the PR for the SPL- Token but i was super confused on how to get the logoURI for the jpeg/png of the coin on github - super newbie here sorry - but I have the rest of the info ready to submit
This isn't an spl program issue, but solana account model problem
that same page/link should have a get account equivalent did you look?  usually get account info get program account, or some such based on your need
Isnt setAuthority used on the TokenAccount model?
you need to use an instruction like `SetAuthority`   you can look up anchor or solana native references to this in the source code, in the SPL or Anchor.  Not sure off hand if anchor has other ways to do this..  but they may also have some example source.
And I'm trying to re-assign the ownership of the mint account to the token program
It fails the last step because the token program is not the owner of the pda account.
So im (1) using a pda to gen a mint address, (2)in the program I allocate space to it for the mint layout, (3) call the token program to initalise the mint.
<@!785084693023424542> is there a way to do it without a subscription? e.g. what if i want to lookup an account right now, from something thats been done in the past
what kind of an account?  your trying to change the token mint? it appears, and in anchor?
you can submit a PR here for SPL-Token related meta data. can take up to 2 weeks to auto merge after filled in correctly.  this is currently how meta data for tokens is done.
Is there a systems api I can call?
Hey there, how can I change the ownership of an account in a program?
I've tried doing this
```
 let pool_token_mint = &mut ctx.accounts.pool_token_mint;
 pool_token_mint.owner = ctx.accounts.token_program.key;
```
but it giving me an error `instruction modified the program id of an account`

The account is initialized, empty and the program is its owner, what can I do?
hello - newbie in rust with very basic understanding of git hub - been following this tutorial on youtube just trying to make a social token for fun and learning purpose.   im trying to add a logo to the token ^^; any assistance would be greatly appriciated

<@!734004076626444369>
<@!785084693023424542> im looking for like an rpc call, as in to lookup an account and fetch ownership changes etc anyone know?
Suspect it's the filtering doing not what I expect
Currently doing this but it doesn't return all stake accounts. It's missing any which have withdrawal authority changed from the stake authority 
```
const parsedStakeAccounts = await connection.getParsedProgramAccounts(
    StakeProgram.programId,
    {
      filters: [
        {
          memcmp: {
            offset: 12,
            bytes: walletAddress.toBase58(),
          },
        },
      ],
    }
  );
```
probably through logs. if available.
hey guys, is there any way to see the previous changes of ownership for an account?
Thank you for your answer
I already use the SDK for python (solana-py) and I don't find how to get the words of my seed
try one of the python SDKs location in <#763249718339567626>
https://spl.solana.com/stake-pool
did you try getProgramAccounts passing the Stake1111 ... program and any additional filter you want?  that should probably work.
I would first then use that as a guide, and go through the token-swap source code, and run the tests inside and get a feel for how it works.
What is the best/most efficient way to get all of a users stake accounts regardless of what the withdraw authority has been set to?
Hello
How to get the seed recovery phrase in clear from a new Keypair
Guys are there any spl token stake program or guide?
No, I have been trying to follow this doc to convert from USDC to SOL: https://spl.solana.com/token-swap
I would be willing as I‚Äôm learning all this as well. DMs are open
It‚Äôs all SPL-TOKEN. It‚Äôs not like you have to deploy a program to mint one. The spl-token docs will tell you how, but you should head to Metaplex Discord if you‚Äôre working on NFT project.
Wrong channel, try <#560174212967432193>
why is findProgramAddress async ? from what I see everything is done locally right?
Hello üôÇ
I got a script in JS to decode my secret key from my Keypair to store it clear:
```
var str_SK = Buffer.from(wallet.secretKey).toString('base64');
console.log(str_SK);
```

I would like to make the same thing in Python but I don't find how to do this.
Can someone help me please ?
or would those requirements be the same as a validator node?
does anyone know the compute requirements for setting up a solana read-only node? not a full validator
It failed the first time without enough sol and gave 1.65SOL as cost, so this should cover it
which is in a buffer account for this deployment
Yes, I airdropped myself 2 sol, after this command I have 0.35 SOL left
DO you have enough SOL in the wallet funding the program?
Problem: I can deploy my Solana program to localhost (solana-test-validator) just fine, but I cannot deploy the same program to devnet.

I run  ```solana program deploy``` on my .so file that I built with ```cargo build-bpf```

This deploys to local solana cluster, I have tested the program end to end and it works fine. But after I change to devnet and try to deploy I only get output:

```Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x1```

adding --verbose flag doesn't give me anything regarding the deployment, only configuration. Is the above output from my own program, or the program that deploys my program? If it's my own program, what is the deployment giving as input?
Hi, guys which function is used to interact with NFTs in a Solana wallet? I'm not able to find a dedicated function regarding NFT or Erc20 token on Web3. Js api for solana
would anyone be up for a couple hour zoom teaching/tutorial help? I wrote a smart contract and I'm confused a bit about deploying it... wether it's all correct etc. I'm happy to pay a reasonable fee for this help.
I have a smart contract already for an NFT project I already did, can the smart contract still work for Solana?
see: https://github.com/tokenspice/tokenspice
is there a library like token spice for solana?
hello


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

is there any way to check the account data of a program via another program on chain?
like we cant do a getAccountInfo() on some slot or block?
is my understanding correct - at this time we're unable to get historical account info with RPC?
You need to have the test validator running: `solana-test-validator`
Is there a way to create a community wallet that uses multisig?
still getting ```error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 111)``` when trying to do pretty much anything on localhost
that's what I thought - mostly just confirming my understanding and leaving details in case useful to somebody else  - thanks!
if you check out token-swap and token-lending, among others you can see examples of calling programs.  CPI, cross program invocations, examples, generally can be found by searching for `invoke_signed` as well in source code. https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#cross-program-invocations
thats expected
can you recommend an example in the program library that uses the rust sdk instead of the js sdk to interact with on chain programs?
sounds right
it looks like the account gets created in the client app with the exact size of the serialized struct, but updating the seed results in a new account being created

```js
const GREETING_SIZE = borsh.serialize(
  GreetingSchema,
  new GreetingAccount(),
).length;

    const transaction = new Transaction().add(
      SystemProgram.createAccountWithSeed({
        fromPubkey: payer.publicKey,
        basePubkey: payer.publicKey,
        seed: GREETING_SEED,
        newAccountPubkey: greetedPubkey,
        lamports,
        space: GREETING_SIZE,
        programId,
      }),
    );
    await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [payer]);
```
it may depend on the size that was allocated what you can add, but your first statement is correct.
That is super cool - once an account has been created with a specified size, it can't be changed right? So in order to add a new field to the greeting struct, you have to create a new greeting account.
Hey, I've got a question about seeds. If I use `Pubkey::create_with_seed` there is no associated bump seed with it, right? So any transaction using that pubkey should only need the seed string (that I used when creating it) for the authority_signer_seeds?
Anyone got an idea on how to trace/track NFT sales that happen on secondary marketplaces? For example when I query XXX token/NFT I see transactions for it, in token holders previous owners, etc. But for some reason on one marketplace it says that sale happened for that NFT, but I don't see it in explorer, only that it changed owner. Any idea on how to track it?
slot is the measure of time, blockheight is the number of blocks under the current block, yes continuous. get blocks can help you get a number of blocks within a measure of time (slots), slots can get skipped and not have a block. a slot leader produces at most 1 block.  
..so slot is time, block is the entries in that time when recorded and get blocks allows you to get blocks in a time period. you can check the time period with onSlot methods, and getBlock methods for data and calc within the block

yea play with it some and log some things. make more fields and see how it works. ` msg!`
okay thanks will do so
use WSL, not windows. if you can try a linux distro or mac instead
got it, so the call to serialize is to overwrite the data on the account with the serialized updated struct - thank you
(If that helps, I'm running WSL2 for Windows)
Hey everybody im new here. i try to run solana cli on windows 10 but not working. any suggestions?
cant start the tmp file
`// get the data
let mut greeting_account = GreetingAccount::try_from_slice(&account.data.borrow())?;

greeting_account.serialize(&mut &mut account.data.borrow_mut()[..])?;`
Hello, I got a noob question regarding block and slot.
I can see on https://explorer.solana.com/ that the block_height is lower than slot(_height).
- What is the difference between these ? I as I though it was the same
- Are blocks (number) or slot always continuous ? If so what is the purpose of the rpc `getBlocks` call?
for example, in this block in the example hello-world program, does the data in the greeter account get physically updated when `greeting_account.counter` is incremented or does that happen with `.serialize`? I was expecting there would be three steps, 1. increment the field on the struct in memory, 2. serialize the struct, 3. update the data in the greeter account, but this looks like only the first two steps.

```rust
    // Increment and store the number of times the account has been greeted
    let mut greeting_account = GreetingAccount::try_from_slice(&account.data.borrow())?;
    greeting_account.counter += 1;
    greeting_account.serialize(&mut &mut account.data.borrow_mut()[..])?;
```
I did 
```

<@785084693023424542> Ok, thank you. I'll check them out
is this the right place to ask super beginner questions?
these are the instructions:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/instruction.rs#L105
you can reference the SPL, token-swap, token-lending, and others for some variations on how they call with seeds.  
searching on `spl_token::instruction::transfer` and seeds, you should be able to find some good examples to fit your situation.
Hey guys , i'm looking for a way to send transactions on-chain every X blocks without setting up an off-chain  RPC service . Is this possible currently ?
<@!785084693023424542> It seems the problem is not in the call to find_program_address but actually while calling spl_token::instruction::transfer. My ```authority_signer_seeds``` are missing something. Do you have any resource about what I should be passing to that function?
nice
strange, i have deleted node modules and reinstalled, now working
dependencies installed
i copied into a component,  but node module errors me, node_modules/@solana/wallet-adapter-base/lib/index.js:1

SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'
how are you using it, and whats the actual error?
i am trying to use https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter on my next app but, /node_modules/@solana/wallet-adapter-base/lib/index.js:1

Are you getting that error on find_program_address?
did you try printing anything to logs and see if there potential issues with the seeds, what is being created, and before its being derived?
Hello. I am trying to build a solana program using ```solana sdk's Pubkey::find_program_address(seeds, &program_id)``` but I am sometimes running into  "Provided seeds do not result in a valid address" errors. I have a few rust tests where I create an account using some seeds, then call a different function that derives the address using the same seeds. Sometimes the find_program_address works and the tests pass with no errors, other times I get the InvalidSeeds error and execution halts even before the compute units are consumed (i.e.  Program C7G... consumed 32125 of 200000 compute units. The way I create the seeds is the same as Metaplex's create_auction program, but with my own data:
```
let seeds = [
    PREFIX.as_bytes(),
    program_id.as_ref(),
    &args.resource.to_bytes(),
];
```
Where ```pub const PREFIX: &str = "sub";``` I have tried with different prefixes, but I keep getting the same spurious error. I'd appreciate any pointers on how to avoid this issue.
you can def call getProgramAccounts. Im just not sure on any specific details if any for collections, editions, or other items that may be Metaplex specific. You can always use getProgramAccounts and apply any config options, filters, etc.
If anyone wants a custom front-end built for candy-machine-mint pm me
Thanks for the reply. Is there not an api url I can call like getProgramAccounts which would return all the addresses in a list in json for the nft owner address or something?
I would try the Metaplex (NFT) discord, if your looking for a non code route, this might help with something.. https://tools.abstratica.art/ not sure on how secure it is.

                system_account.clone(),
            ],
        )?;
awesome. what approach did you take
I've just done it
you want to send sol to a program?  or an account owned by a program? from within a program, web3 or cli?
yeah essentially staking but theres no passive rewards just one upfront
thats essentially staking with a lock/vesting period right?  im not sure on the details, for NFTs specifically, but it might involve the user transfering delegation/authority/ownership to your program for the lockup period.
I would like to see if the possibility of a system like this is possible. User has NFT locks it inside a contract and gets a token as receipt which can be used for some things. After a time period of 1 week is over the user can reclaim the NFT or decide to lock it one more week for another receipt.
I guess it depends what you mean? and in the program? and how your version of locking works.  you can 'lock' tokens over time, for things like vesting, in a stake pool for example, if you have control of them. I dont believe you can do much if you are not the owner/authority on the token and or mints involved. Metaplex discord may have some answers as well in regards to NFT specifics.
this is awesome, thanks!
id try the metaplex discord ymmy, maybe candy machine program id?  not sure the best method for that off hand.
for anchor, the workspace refers to the files and folders your in, related to the [workspace] generally listed in the cargo.toml or anchor.toml files..  you need to be in a folder that has a workspace. you can also try the anchor discord and check it out for anchor specific talk and issues: 
https://discord.gg/T8m5RUmz
Does anyone know how to send SOL to the pubkey in program
I was trying to integrate with an anchor application. I decided to use their CPI implementation to avoid the need for me to manage the seeds directly. Thanks for offering to help though
how doable is it to lock nfts inside a contract?
That's confusing
I can't be in a workspace if the workspace isn't built can I?
I'm trying to run a project locally, I'm in the repo and when I try to run `anchor build`  I get an error: `thread 'main' panicked at 'Not in workspace.', cli/src/lib.rs:522:47`, what does it mean?
you should be able to check the account info and -> do something like:
`const account = await connection.getAccountInfo(publicKey);`
if the account exists, do x, else, do y.
I need to do something like this in js:
```
if an account with this Pubkey exists
  do x
else
  do y
```
How would I do the if check? Is there a method for that in solana web3js?
Hi, everybody, is there any way to get all NFT created using token metadata program please?
related, how do you search for historical transactions with RPC, or solana/web3?
seeing this now
or any other RPC call for that matter
is it possible to call RPC getAccountInfo() historically, like for a specific slot that already happened?
Thanks a lot. I will give it a try.
If you don't derive from `Pack` then you need to somehow hydrate the struct from `account_data`
<@!835400688925278229> 
```rust
let account_info_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let program_account = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
    // Get the account 'state' data location
    let mut account_data = program_account.data.borrow_mut();
    // Unpacking an uninitialized account state will fail. THIS ASSUMES YOU'VE DERIVED THE 'Pack' trait
    let mut account_state = ProgramAccountState::unpack(&account_data)?;
    account_state.add(key, value)?;
    ProgramAccountState::pack(account_state, &mut account_data)?;
```
Hi everyone, I'm trying to build a candy machine in devnet and keep running into this error, does anyone know how to resolve this. I am using windows 10 and i have Solana v1.7.12
Hi, I am trying to update account data this is my code but i throws me various rust exception.  What is the correct way to do it ?
true. thank you
However; The location of the 'program instruction' in the [u8] is up to the program developer....
when the input is read by the program inside process instruction, the first byte is the instruction. so when you create your instruction, you will use the first byte for that. Some good examples are in the SPL Solana Program Library, in particular 
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/record/program/src/instruction.rs
Where enums are used to define the instructions. 
You can see how they are called by following the functional.rs file in the tests folder
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/record/program/tests
And follow it through the other files to see how instructions are built and processed
or if you mean how do you get the default one, that's using `Token.getAssociatedTokenAddress` from the spl-token library
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountsbyowner this?
how can I find Token Account for Specific Token and Owner Account?
hey guys
Hello, Am writing tests on rust. how to convert an instructions into [u8] and pass it to process_instructions?

under https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getProgramAccounts, have you looked into the GetProgramAccountsConfig https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#GetProgramAccountsConfig and the DataSlice?
hello
is it possible
I don't want a filter on some data, I just want the first x account for example
my app crash because it takes too much memory if I request all accounts
Hello, how can I getProgramAccounts but only return the first x, and not have everything ?

some programs have a lot of account and I would like to look the first x, then the next x, etc, etc. for example for Images on metaplex.
Would love your help on this
<@!788215642070581289> any thoughts?

not sure what client code you used but you have to check your owner as the error message says
it should be a full tx witch you has serialized or get from https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
you can't deserialize by a txhash
oh sorry. I misunderstand your qn.
you can use ```curl your-endpoint-here -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '

Hey, using jsonrpc - if I have the NFT Update Authority address, how do I get let's say all 10,000 NFT addresses for that collection?
is there an issue with the PR or what is the request? and what is the link to the PR.
Yes we did
you mean the SPL-Token List?  did you submit a PR @ https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list ?
Need help getting the SPL library updated with our token we are launching - can someone please assist !
here is the token constructor:

https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/c371995c86d1ec21e5a44a76ed27152389024a2e/token/js/module.d.ts#L72
anything related to token bindings can be found here

https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/module.d.ts
```    constructor(
      connection: Connection,
      publicKey: PublicKey,
      programId: PublicKey,
      payer: Signer,
    );```
what is the value of ``fromWallet``?
Here is an example:

```js
  //Construct usdc token class
  var usdcMint = new web3.PublicKey("EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v");
  var newToken = new splToken.Token(
    connection,
    mint,
    splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
    fromWallet
  );```
instead of create mint, you get the mint
so what do i do about these values? since they require the mint object
```js
 const fromTokenAccount = await mint.getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo(
    fromWallet.publicKey,
  );

  //get the token account of the toWallet Solana address, if it does not exist, create it
  const toTokenAccount = await mint.getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo(
    toWallet.publicKey,
  );
```
no you wouldn't need to do create in that case
if i want to mint a token from someones contract do i still have to use the createMint method?
np

It should just be `&[seeds1, seeds2]` instead of  `&[seeds]` in the singular case.  LMK if you're stuck tomorrow (ie, +12 hours) and I can whip up an example, it's mfbt where I'm at
gl brother, maybe a core wizard will enlighten us with a knowledge bomb lol
Same. I'll just keep plugging away at it
yea I've only ever worked with 1 at a time but I'd start shot gunning everything I could think of and that's just what immediately came to my mind ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Like if I only have 1 PDA seeds in the transaction?
The request won't be denied but will affect when the tx is scheduled
Does anyone encountered any issue minting on both testnet / devnet ?
does it fail if you derive the seeds for any of the 4 accounts and send it?
Hey everyone, are there any examples of a transaction with multiple signer seeds?
I have a transaction that takes 4 PDAs and I'm not sure how the signer_seeds array is suppose to look for invoke_signed.
One more question: is there some likelihood that this request for a higher cap will be denied/will fail? And under which circumstances? Trying to architect a robust solution for some of our methods that do a lot of i/o. If you could point me towards source code for this update that would also be appreciated

yea & w/ wsl2 being able to mount as a file path in explorer it's pretty much the same anyways

well, you can use windows, just opt for WSL
Thank you for the reply
Wow. Why is this? I have a Mac I can use
when i use ``Keypair.generate`` how do i later convert the private key to string so that i could retrieve it in phantom wallet?
I'm not sure if there's a single person in the world who is using the sol tool suite on windows
WSL is strongly recommended for people who decide to drive Windows. The first class platforms are Linux and macOS

Yeah, exactly

It's weird
Successive runs
maybe there was an update to the library or something? not sure
Sometimes it works, sometimes not
I see. The strange thing is that I have made this transaction before with the same wallet succesffully

How would I go about creating a bot on twitter or discord to track the sales on secondary markets?
`create_pda_account()` is a useful routine that you can copy into your program to create/initialize a PDA.  A usage example is here [2].

[1] https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/associated-token-account/program/src/tools/account.rs#L13
[2] https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/abc06eed687f453a81eb0160416da60e623b642b/associated-token-account/program/src/processor.rs#L77
so for a PDA, you still need to use the system program to assign ownership of the PDA account to your program.  But this can only be done by your program itself as a CPI since there's no other way to "sign" a transaction with a PDA
The rules around account ownership for a PDA are the same as normal accounts.  The *only* difference is that a normal account address is an ed25519 public key and there exists (or existed) a private key that can sign a transaction, whereas a PDA address is not an ed25519 public key and no private key exists.  When you call `invoke_signed()` from your program with a PDA address, the runtime pretends that the PDA signed the transaction for the purposes of invoking that inner instruction
OK, I'm going wrong on how to set the owner of the PDA account to be the program.
```    Program log:  pda_account.key: 4HUKhxQvV14ERfSH7PtE2cN7wrcRdRZMYua3vH2aCijy
    Program log:  pda_account.owner: 11111111111111111111111111111111```
I'm assigning it the client by doing:
```[pda_account, bump_seed] = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(seeds, programId);```
And passing it in the transaction instruction:
 `keys[0] = {pubkey: pda_account, isSigner: false, isWritable: true},`
And getting it out on the program side the traditional way:
```    let account_info_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let pda_account = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;```

Why is the pda_account.owner the system_program and not my program?
they are just trying to debit lamports, this doesn't have anything to do with tokens
for token transfers you can probably just pass in the payer as signer, derive the pda inside the program, and use that as a signer as long as its the account owner/authority. you just need to make sure you pass the 'PDA' account key expected to the program so it can derive the address.

> What should the signer value be?
It doesn't matter.  A program can debit lamports from any account it owns regardless of who signed the transaction
not able to make threads anymore, but here is some info that may help. Up front, if you check source code of `token-swap` and `token-lending` for some relatable code and search on `::find_program_address` for examples of pda, seeds, and keys/signing. For your more exact case also adding `spl_token::instruction::transfer` into the search may help, if not in SPL, the other resources.
Ill look into that
no problem! this stuff is very tricky, you definitely were logging the right stuff üôÇ
for now <@!847370708623294475> you can build from source
seriously appreciate it
bless you for your help
<@!440990411591254037> can we get a new deployment for https://crates.io/crates/spl-token-metadata
Anyways, definitely not on you!
I see
not yet
did you figure out your issue?
and not set to writable in the instruction
```
[AccountMeta { pubkey: 5UuQTwq8Byw8YwC89SQ4WLyax44QVQDVkr1rfRVMcHQB, is_signer: false, is_writable: true }, AccountMeta { pubkey: 3mdAYFAXH9vq61eoAGCgDL4hwoBxuu28FBXbCrLhDDea, is_signer: false, is_writable: false }, AccountMeta { pubkey: 82UV2Exn5FaS4Ys1fxiHBPW1tQVeU1R76BbVkAE7WaTL, is_signer: true, is_writable: false }, AccountMeta { pubkey: 82UV2Exn5FaS4Ys1fxiHBPW1tQVeU1R76BbVkAE7WaTL, is_signer: true, is_writable: false }, AccountMeta { pubkey: 82UV2Exn5FaS4Ys1fxiHBPW1tQVeU1R76BbVkAE7WaTL, is_signer: true, is_writable: false }, AccountMeta { pubkey: 11111111111111111111111111111111, is_signer: false, is_writable: false }, AccountMeta { pubkey: SysvarRent111111111111111111111111111111111, is_signer: false, is_writable: false }]
```
you can see that the account in quesiton was definitely writable
debugging with preflight off can be pretty helpful

ah yes
it takes a `ConfirmOptions` object
nope, I assume you're using https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#sendAndConfirmTransaction
on the connection object?
the tx will be processed and fail, then you can share the signature here
set `skipPreflight` to true

how are you sending tx's?
sorry, new to all of this still, how do I get the link to the failed tx?
that explorer link is not a failed tx
np
yeah I should've noticed that considering I had it dumping out
in your case, `cmda_instruction` has the order of account keys
right
the order is defined in the ix
because the payer is also the mint authority and update authority (for now)
oh ok, I thought the indexed order of accounts was important
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4FMGHY78x7cJr3unzGK8xaLedWfwHXoAuEgyFaio25WaYpBhwL59oYsZRm44eVbmci8RCbtaqgJjcbsm1AAqUgx1?cluster=devnet

this won't fix your issue, but just an fyi that account infos just need one instance of each account, so it's pointless to pass the payer multiple times
yea 1 sec

it's basically a metaplex thing, can you share your code?

Hey y'all. I'm trying to grab metadata given a token address, and I haven't been able to figure out how to grab it. Could anyone help me out?

It's been suggested we can mutate the accounts directly if the program is the owner. Or add funds to any destination account.
Trying to mint an NFT using ***PYTHON*** and the solana-py library. ***tokenClient.create_mint*** creates something on the blockchain.
So first I set up the tokenClient
```
wallet = kp.Keypair.from_secret_key(secretKey)
conn = Client('https://api.devnet.solana.com')
TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID = PublicKey('TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA')  # minter program
mintKey = PublicKey('HA4eV1gAFTxS1wJKfb5nz8SEPLwNM6esVkEgudcvhPw1')
tokenClient = Token(conn=conn, pubkey=wallet.public_key, program_id=TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, payer=wallet)
```

Then I do this:

```newNFT = tokenClient.create_mint(
    conn=conn,
    payer=wallet,
    mint_authority=wallet.public_key,
    decimals=0,
    program_id=TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,)
```

Next I want to actually mint a token:

```addToken = newNFT.mint_to(mint_authority=TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
                          amount=1,
                          dest=wallet.public_key,
                          # decimals=0
                          )
```

and this throws an error:
***AttributeError: transaction feePayer required***
I'm a bit lost, as I've set the payer to be my wallet (which is a keypair)
I've dug through the documentation and the source code for the python SPL token, still I can't figure out what is happening. Maybe I'm setting the wrong mint authority?
Can you avoid using invoke_signed and do this way?
```    let account_info_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let source_account_info = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
    let dest_account_info = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;

    let dest_starting_lamports = dest_account_info.lamports();
    msg!("dest_starting_lamports: {}", dest_starting_lamports);

    **dest_account_info.lamports.borrow_mut() = dest_starting_lamports + source_account_info.lamports();
    msg!("dest_ending_lamports: {}", dest_account_info.lamports());

    **source_account_info.lamports.borrow_mut() = 0;
    msg!("source_account_info.lamports: {}", source_account_info.lamports());
```
but when I try to leverage the token meta program to do the same thing it rejects me
here's one on the chain https://explorer.solana.com/address/B7ck7xEQyR5dQr4znnVkeoA9L2y85UHHtvW8kSEfM5aj?cluster=devnet
yeah, create an account for the pda
What did you manage todo with `invoke_signed`? Transfer lamports?
and I've tested a 3rd pda account local & owned & derived form my program which works great with invoke_signed so I'm just kind of confused
yeah pretty much, although in my case the payer is the signer,
I'm still struggling with this too. My understanding is you need to have the following keys:
```    keys: [
      {pubkey: pda_account, isSigner: false, isWritable: true},
      {pubkey: payer.publicKey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true},
      {pubkey: programKeypair.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true},
    ],```
Is that what you're doing?
the cpi call is the token metadata program so I'm 100% sure it's a me issue but I can't pin point where how or why
anyone have any insight?
man, I'm still getting this error
> Cross-program invocation with unauthorized signer or writable account',
and it's kicking my ass. I've double checked my pda seed works on other invoke_signed methods & I've double checked the accounts are all appropriatley set as writable / is_signer
Got it, thanks for the info!
if i want to mint a token should i be using ``SPLToken.Token.createMintToInstruction`` or ``TransactionInstruction``
I'm trying to manipulate the lamports of the PDA where the owner is the program using the example given:
```let account_info_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
let source_account_info = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
let dest_account_info = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;

let dest_starting_lamports = dest_account_info.lamports();

**dest_account_info.lamports.borrow_mut() = dest_starting_lamports + source_account_info.lamports();

**source_account_info.lamports.borrow_mut() = 0;
```
But I'm confused if I should be passing a `signer` variable to the transaction. What should the `signer` value be?
```const signers = [];
const instruction = new TransactionInstruction({
  keys: [
    {pubkey: pda, isSigner: false, isWritable: true},
    {pubkey: payer.publicKey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true},
  ],
  programId,
  data: Buffer.alloc(1), // All instructions are hellos
});

await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  new Transaction().add(instruction),
  signers,
)```
Anybody understand why I'm getting this  error...
```SendTransactionError: failed to send transaction: invalid transaction: index out of bounds
...
(/Users/ph/Projects/solana/helloworld-pda/node_modules/@solana/web3.js/src/util/send-and-confirm-transaction.ts:29:21) {

  data: Buffer.alloc(1), // All instructions are hellos
});

await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  new Transaction().add(instruction),
  signers,
)```
It's something todo with this `const signers = [programKeypair];` because if I change that, the transaction sends (but there is another error).  How do I send the programKeypair?
The plan is to add support for a request instruction that requests for a higher compute cap transaction wide (instruction count is going to switch to transaction wide and keep the current 200k limit, aka, 200k per transaction default unless requesting for more).  The changes are currently in master and being backported to v1.7, though we might wait to enable them on v1.7 for a while based on some cost model/fee changes
would I just submit a post request with the correct parameters?
how would I go about making a request to this endpoint from the frontend? I'm basically trying to check if a user is holding a specific NFT and I was pointed to this link

hello, does the ``SPLToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID`` ever change? or does it stay the same no matter what contract im trying to mint from?
Can programs be cloned? or just regular accounts?
I'm trying to write some local tests that run on solana-test-validator using programs on devnet. Are there tips tricks to using `--clone` on the test-validator?
Metaplex is currently owning the NFT standard. Check out Metaplex for your answers
why is the documentation so incomplete?
none of the tutorials on solana website shares any detail on adding metadata to a nft token
or a standalone libary
hi guys is the only way to do the nft meta data things with metaplex? of have they realsed a better library?
Does every transaction hash has a fixed length chars?
write back here if you find something useful. I'll do as well
if you would call `token_proxy` a program, what would you call `proxy_transfer`?
just not sure how we can do it from the client or smart contract
I know there's a CLI command for it
oops didn't read this thread
umm I just asked that
Hi.  Is there anyone here who has deployed Metaplex / Candy Machine who'd be interested in helping me out a little on a deployment?  Its up and running on Github pages atmo but I'm having a few issues getting it fully commissioned.
Does anyone know where I can find an example of wrapping SOL into a token?  Is that the proper way to store SOL and use the Token Program?
Is there an easy way to wrap native SOL as an SPL token? I want to have a unique program interface (i.e. treat everything as an SPL token) and need a way to wrap SOL on a client side
yay :)
thank you üôÇ I realized that I was trying it with wrong program id,
found the answer on documentation üôÇ
pretty sure you can pass in `programId: <token program id>` instead of mint
Hi, I have an easy question for you guys, 
let token_accounts_by_owner_info = await connection.getTokenAccountsByOwner(walletPublicKey, {mint: rayProgramAdress} )
this one works if I give a certain mint adress (I tried RAY token), what should I use if I wanna fetch all tokens without filtering it.

oh sick, do you know around how much higher the limit will be?
Thanks a lot! The app will be mostly only use the initial connection to signup users, therefore I will be looking into signMessage (so far only Phantom and Sollet, I believe) the inital signup will allow the user to create an additional passphrase for their wallet that will be used to login in the future. Thanks for the input! So I might end up needing to learn React or Vue properly after all to ease things üòÑ
this to me seems more about how your allowing your app/user to interact with your app, and the wallet. Unless your just going to allow anyone to create accounts on your dime and behalf, youll want the users wallet to sign off on the account creation transaction. Your app likely will be sending the transactions, in which case you need the provider/connection/wallet context. What you probably want to be doing is figure out how to carry the provider/wallet/connection context throughout your app, or at least in the parts that would be responsible for sending transactions.  Either wrapping the app parts that you do have with the connection/wallet context, or passing instead your data for the transaction to the wallet/provider context/component, then having that context create and sign the transaction, etc.  This appears to be more of a front end design and framework issue and wallet integration in general.

Here's one: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/c371995c86d1ec21e5a44a76ed27152389024a2e/associated-token-account/program/src/tools/account.rs#L51-L65
appreciate it, yeah I must be deriving the pda wrong or something. looking at some examples where this is being done right would be nice
A PDA has no private key by definition. Only the program that the PDA was derived for can "sign" with that account as a `invoke_signed()` CPI call. LMK if you'd like a link to an example of this
Anyone an idea or a hint for me? Would be greatly appreciated üòä
that seems so dumb to type lol
using the pda in solanaweb3 can I generate a signature?
I have a PDA public key that I need to create an account for so it can be owned & writable by this sub program, but I can't create the account for it because I don't have the pk
ok I think I've nailed down my issue to this

this question from me seems well formed enough to provide a specific answer but let me know if thats not the case
if you're not using anchor that's probably your first mistake!
we're all going through the ringer unfortunately brother
sort of but it's hard to validate without actually attempting to create something / i don't find it very learnful to just ingest docs
or alternatively find some existing working code that uses the SPL mint code and edit it to see what breaks
the other thing to try is actually just play around with plugging in different accounts
have you tried understanding the basic programming model of solana first
I think there are some fundamentals I'm not understanding. it seems like my program would be responsible for making this account. but it also seems like all accounts used by an instruction are inputs to the instruction.
ü§û ill give this version a go!
ty ty Ill double check
it's not a program
it's the public key of the mint account, which is where all the information about the mint will go
The signer should convey.  But be sure to set the second param of `AccountMeta::new()` to true for the `invoke()` call
specifically I'm not sure I understand what the mint address would be / why it would be different than the address of my program

I am making headway however I've come to a road block, my cross program invocation has it's own system program transfer to create an account, using a signed account that my original program has that I've passed in, `failed: Cross-program invocation with unauthorized signer or writable account` - is the isSigner not carrying through to my sub program invocation?

Can a program have any number of accounts of the same type?  Like adding a new token pair to a dex program. Would you have a program that kept track of the token pairs or would the token pair program have multiple accounts
Not possible.  Only a program can write to accounts that it owns
Hey guys, is it possible to create an account with some data preloaded using **offchain** rpc invocation?
maybe
I just figured it out
Is it possible to change the data of an Account from the client side? i.e., there is a solana program instruction for doing it?
it seems like a red herring and I just don't know how to proceed, I spent 4 hours last night trying to get it to work and I'm just absolutely stumped üò≠
is their program really so unoptimized that it burns out my compute units?
by the time I get to the point of my contract where I invoke the token meta data program I have this `consumed 52510 of 200000 compute units` so I've got 75% of my execution limit to basically stamp my nft with meta data
yes, most likely after v1.8 ships to mainnet (a couple months from now)
unfortunately this only happens when I invoke the token meta data program. and I'd previously set the account holding the meta token program to be executable, so I'm really just not sure what the matter is
It's actually pretty restrictive if you're doing anything nontrivial
Are there any plans to raise the instruction compute limit from 200k?

Okay thanks a lot, just first time installing dependencies and tools to explore full stack solana development
I have no idea what you're trying to do. But to just use the solana-cli, there shouldn't be a difference in, say, v1.7.12 windows release
Will there be any issue if I use a previous windows release? Like v1.6.27
Or use an earlier Windows release
does anyone know of a multisig/split fee contract?

Use Linux or MacOS, or build from source on Windoze

I'm new on Solana, so I'd like to know if you guys can help me
is there some way to create NFTs smart contracts? any public repo on Github, maybe?
(I am just a noob, so don't trust me) To do that you need to have a client sending the instruction periodically. On-chain programs are very simple, and it seems that there is no way to have a *periodic* program (without depending on a client).
This is working
Finally after three days of search
```rust
let d = DerivationPath::new_bip44(Some(0), Some(0));
let seed = generate_seed_from_seed_phrase_and_passphrase(&mnemonic_words, &"");
let wallet = keypair_from_seed_and_derivation_path(&seed, Some(d)).unwrap();

println!("{:?}", wallet.pubkey());
```
if worked!!!

Hey all working on an NFT project and want to build a whitelist for our presale I am not finding any great documentation online on the best way to do this, would appreciate some help or pointers in the right direction
different token has different mint pubkey, not sure what is you really want to get.
if you have token name maybe can refer to https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list
if you have token account you can parse its data and get mint pubkey
You can use the rent sysvar from within the program, approximately like this:
```
 let rent = Rent::get();
 let required_lamports = rent.minimum_balance(/* account data size = */ 1234).max(1);
```
Hi everyone, when I create an account in a program, how do I get the minimum balance for rent exemption? Is there any fn I am missing here? Similar to solana_client::rpc_client::RpcClient get_minimum_balance_for_rent_exemption, but for in program usage? Thanks in advance...

(This is just a Rust question I think)
(This is on-chain program)
(`competition` is of type `Competition`)
I tried this initially, but I the program fails when deserializing the competition_account data into Competition (because the account data is empty, I think)
This does not work. But anyway, there must be some simpler way to do this
competition is borsch serializable/deserializable
Another question (related): I have a variable (it's a serializable struct) and I have an account with empty data. How do I dump that variable into the account?
Basically, my case scenario is just write/read from accounts and read/write instructions data. And I was wondering why not just do some deep copy (don't know exactly how) between buffers/variables. Probably in Rust, the easier way do this is precisely using those serializer libraries. (But I come from C, and I was just thinking is something like memcpy).

passing around streams of bytes is much more memory efficient

I thought you were referring to serialization in general.
Yeah there is no standard for serialization. Borsh is just what many choose to use, but not all
Do note though, borsh isn't the only method.
It is faster in memory and compression. Also provides for consistency and safe coding practices. You can read more on borsh here https://borsh.io/
I am writing both the client and the on-chain program in Rust. In this case, isn't serialization/deserialization just computation overhead? What do you mean by efficiency? Memory efficiency? Does borsch apply compression? (sorry if questions are dumb, i am not really seeing advantage)
It's optimizing for the language the solana blockchain is written in, Rust.
Speed and efficiency.
i don't believe you could just query the blockchain using RPC to find a memo. i think you'd need to know the transaction
great, is it possible to search ledger for some specific memo?
What are the advantages in serializing (e.g., with borsch) the data of the accounts? Make the data programming-language-independent?
https://spl.solana.com/memo
the easiest way to accomplish this would be using the memo program

if you can share your code I can take a look
yeh it makes sense to pass it in
has anyone figured out ways to identify if a specific program's tokens (NFTs) were transacted via specific marketplace wallets (like Digitaleyes, MagicEden) and the price they sold for? sort of like an events system?
Yeah, their example has you passing it in. I'm not sure how you guys are avoiding hitting this error https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/92b68352d1958ce4444a68d30c5e3ca7031103ce/program-test/src/lib.rs#L361
to be honest, I think I'm passing mine in also, hm...
can you skip passing that account in?
Yup, I am trying to make an spl account and it errors out saying that it can't resize it.
So the error you're getting is, it's comparing the data size of that account to the data size when you want to init
You can pass uninitialized accounts to your smart contracts. Looks something like this 
```rust
Instruction {
  program_id,
  accounts: vec![
    AccountMeta::new(PDA_pubkey, false),
  ],
  data: data,
};
```
Not quite working on Windows yet.
<@!455114989397868556>
nah, haven't looked into running tests yet

how are you passing in the account if you're yet to use the create_account function?
Are you running your test with the test-bpf feature?
Basically replicating the exactly same steps that were in mvines example
As an AccountInfo? Yeah, in my test I create a transaction to hit my api. I pass the newly found pubkey as an account in the transaction.
are you passing an account to the function?
and I verify that the account doesn't exist on the network in the test
Shouldn't, I am running it locally in a unit test
what's it's pubkey?
could the account already exist?
`Account data resizing not supported yet`. I just copied their generate_pda function like you did and am creating a pubkey with find_program_address.
what error you getting?
Nah, I just changed size of PDA to 1 instead of zero and it still worked
okay thanks but is there any way to use it on windows or is it not working at the moment ?
Use WSL with Ubuntu
Let me check...
Does your code throw an error if you set the size of the PDA to be anything other than zero?

  }

  const mnemonic = bip39.generateMnemonic();
  console.log('Your mnemonic:', mnemonic);

  console.log('Account:', account);
  console.log('Public Key:',   account.publicKey.toString());

Can anybody link a resouce or suggest a google search that will help me understand how to convert bytes (used in the instruction data) and convert them into objects. I'm looking at some examples in the SPL and elsewhere but they look like magic if you don't understand it like this one:
```                let destination_token_address = rest
                    .get(64..96)
                    .and_then(|slice| slice.try_into().ok())
                    .map(Pubkey::new)
                    .ok_or(InvalidInstruction)?;```

I have 2 options for you.
1) if you don't have special reason, I think you can just use create account instead of create account with seed. your new account is also a signer if you use create account.
2) you can put Create account with seed into your program. so it will be
    - your instruction
           a. create account with seed
           b. your instruction really want to do
it will be one instruction in your transaction but actually you do two things via invoke
not sure what you mean? do you want to detect is wallet a contract wallet or normal wallet ?
you can try `solana program close --buffers` remember choose correct network
It takes them a little while, not sure how long but they get lot's of requests

Hi guys I'm new to the channel and the Solana Community I was wondering is there an exchange or a way to buy and sell SOL programmatically? I only saw the API for managing a wallet and making transfers
<@!814228493302497301> you're using rust, is there anything that I can refer to in TS or something?
Thanks a lot, I will try to find the source code. Thanks a lot üôÇ
What is the best approach to fetch accounts owned by a program, that are used by a specific wallet? For example, when a wallet connects to a dapp, how to get existing accounts used by that wallet in that program? Is the best approach to create a pda with the wallet as seed and transfer the ownership of the account to that pda?
Hmmm... so most programs I've seen use a u8 instruction (i.e. 0 = Initialize, 1 = DoThis, 2 = DoThat) that the Program does a big `match` to then jump to the logic that satisfies the instruction request. To know that, you would need to look at the source code of the program first. From using the Rust RpcClient the instructions I serialized using `borsh` for example
https://github.com/hashblock/solana-cli-program-template/blob/main/src/utils/txn_utils.rs#L198
I just wanna read the transaction, like, My goal is to be able to say that the transaction swapped x amount of tokenA for y amount of tokenB?
Are you looking to deserialize/reverse engineer the Program logic? Or are you looking to just deserialize the Instructions? Or are you looking to deserialize a Program Account data?
Easy enough to find out, add the crate and some instructions in your program and do `cargo build-bpf`... it will puke if there is a problem (like use of `rand`, etc.)
Hey everybody! How can I perform SafeMath correctly in rust Solana programs?

This is how empty buffer looks in console.log()
`<Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00>`

This is what I get

It seems it cannot parse the data corretly to uint8Array, any ideas?
Using javascript
Guys Im having trouble with BufferLayout after decoding a message from escrow program
Thank you, I will take a look at this, I am unable to find any articles on this topic, so I have all the tx data, just don't know how to make sense of it. üò¶
you can take a look at https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/web3.js/src/system-program.ts#L243
also If you want to deserialize a custom program's instruction, you need to know how it serialize its instruciton.
Thank you if anyone had same issue we have to pass origin account keypair to --upgrade-authority in solana deploy command
anyone?
okay so i need to pass the origin account as signer in deploy command
if you has deployed program on the account, the second times you redeployed, you will need to use origin owner to sign the tx.
i dont know i have deployed same when on linux i recently switched to wsl and getting these errors
anyone ?
Although I am very new to Solana (literally just 40 mins old lol!!) but these articles are clearing quite a things
Ahh!!! I see..thanks for this one also.
if your account's owner is still system program, you can use https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/SystemProgram.html#allocate
And the guides are sometimes vague on which addresses need to be set in the .env file
Yup, I recommend this guide as well https://hackmd.io/@levicook/HJcDneEWF#Install-the-metaplex-command-line-utility. But for some reason most guides I saw skipped over the ‚Äúcreate-candy-machine‚Äù command, which is important lmao
Is it possible to alter an account bytes allocation?
Its gonna take me some time to go through your repo and understand it, thanks. But, this should sum up my task, right?
or a pointer to help interpret the transactions so that I can write a custom parser if one doesn't already exist?
No worries, I‚Äôm gonna add some pictures and more information about the react hooks, but mostly everything u need is there
Wow, This is so cool!! Thank you loads!!!
There is no smart contract development required. Not to advertise for myself, but if you follow my instructions here https://github.com/maxwellfortney/next-candy-machine you can have minting functionality up within a couple minutes if you already have your art and json data, and have metaplex and Solana cli installed
Can someone tell me how I can Filter logs by events like transfer, swap, mint, etc?
Ok got it. Can you also give just a rough estimation on how much time it will take to make such a marketplace(Not the design part, the part that only includes smart contract development) 
For reference: The NFT website is going to be just like an ordinary website.

Thanks
You will want to use Candy Machine if your goal is to allow people to mint NFTs through your website.
Thank you.
so. is this the right place to ask about the right contract price for a Solana job? :0
you can use ```
curl http://api.devnet.solana.com -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '

Hi everyone, I am really very new to Solana, but I want to create a NFT. My questions are how can I do it, where to start and how much time will it take for the development?
you can't change the owner if the data not all 0. in the other words, if you write modified it. you can't change the owner
Amazing it looks like its using metaplex, and im an angular/nodejs dev so i will be trying that direction first but i can most def use your project as inspiration

For anybody thats having some trouble getting Candy Machine up and running
https://github.com/maxwellfortney/next-candy-machine
Hello friends! 
I want to clarify one more point with you.
Can this situation happen (it's just a guess):
- for example, there was some new slots produced. 
But for some reason this slots was reverted somehow (hard-fork e.t.c or for some other reason).
Can this situation happen somehow? Is it possible?
p.s. just analyzing for some possible double spending situations e.t.c.
Is there some detailed docs or guide about this somewhere?
Hello guys, is there any way to get a list of all NFTs minted on solana so far? something like API or other service.
Thank you for the information

yup, its installed with the solana toolchain. `solana-test-validator`
Hi, upon developing applications in the Ethereum network, we can use a local test blockchain supported by ganache.
Is there a tool of any kind for Solana blockchain as well?
May I ask if I can change the owner of an account after it has some data write in? I got the ModifiedProgramId error if I do it on-chain using the `assign` instruction.
yeah that is a correct syntax (the code worked) but still I get signature verification error. I am going to give a pause and try this again tomorrow with fresh eyes...thanks for all the help!
something like       `transaction.sign(myAccount)`
thanks. how do I sign with myAccount? I did get `Signature verification failed` error..
I also noticed I didn't sign with myAccount in my code snippet above so you'll probably have to add that
yup
```
import {
  useAnchorWallet,
  useConnection,
  useWallet,
} from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react';
```
uhh I think just the adapter, sec
Thanks your suggestions have been very helpful so far. One quick question: `const { connection } = useConnection();`  which library exposes `useConnection` hook?
but not in testnet, have also set env to testnet url...any help would really be appreciated..Thanks
its working in devnet
I am using metaplex to upload my assets but it is giving error TypeError: Cannot read property 'data' of null after running the below command
ts-node ~/xyz/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts upload ./assets --env testnet ‚Äîkenpair /path
https://discord.gg/QNzXKUzm
the only thing I can assume from that error message is that `my_account` should be a PDA that's owned by the executing program, but the anchor docs don't do that either. 
I think best is you ask over at the anchor discord
So I deployed the following program https://github.com/maddyonline/anchor-basic-1-example using 
```
anchor deploy  --provider.cluster devnet
```
Above example is a clone of https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/tree/master/examples/tutorial/basic-1


Then I am trying to run a react app which uses Phantom wallet to sign the ‚Äúinitialize‚Äù transaction.
https://github.com/maddyonline/anchor-react-starter

But it fails with the following error:
```
The given account is not owned by the executing program
```
if you still have authority over it, I think you can just call the metadata program and update it without issues
or use a URL you control for the metadata json like mysite.com/metadata/1.json, then update that json file
You could try to manually sign the transaction and see if that does anything
```ts
const { connection } = useConnection();
const wallet = useAnchorWallet();

const instruction = await program.instruction.initialize(new anchor.BN(1234), {
    accounts: {
        myAccount: myAccount.publicKey,
        user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
        systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
    }
});

const transaction = new web3.Transaction({ feePayer: wallet.publicKey });
transaction.add(mintInstruction);
transaction.recentBlockhash = (
  await connection.getRecentBlockhash()
).blockhash;

await wallet.signTransaction(transaction);

const transactionHash = await web3.sendAndConfirmRawTransaction(
    connection,
    transaction.serialize()
);
console.log(transactionHash);
```
I have a collection of about 10,000 tokens and I have the metadata set to some initial pre-reveal JSON file‚Ä¶ at the reveal date I want to update the metadata for all the tokens. Is there any easy way to do that?
Is there any way I can use a private RPC to update NFT token metadata for an NFT I make?
I don't see anything obviously wrong on first glance with the code ü§î
you can also post it here
please let me know if I should be looking elsewhere, I'm curious how people are able to build sales bots for NFTs for marketplaces, when the marketplaces themselves don't have an open API. Is this because they are reading from the blockchain directly? Is there an SDK/API from Solana side that would enable this? Any direction would be appreciated! üôè 

I noticed the solana solidity repo had something called events, but wasn't sure if that is what would be needed. Something like a combo of an event and the addresses involved maybe?
I think so but let me verify again
the onchain program is the same?

Hey guys I am brand new to solana/rust. I am trying to understand how to create a smart contract for an NFT collection. Are there any samples out there?

I am coming over from solidity/eth where I understand a lot. Is there like etherscan equivalent?

Now I have Z and Y, I want to have X
I have owner (X), mint (Y) then I use getAssociatedTokenAddress to get associated address (Z).
oh sorry, I'll try another way to explain

Does anyone know if it is possible to create a login system for a website that relies solely on the user connecting their wallet?  I've been trying to figure out how to authenticate requests to the backend.  I've been playing around with having the user sign a message with their wallet and use that as an authorization token but I keep finding holes in that solution that I'm not sure how deal with.  

Does anyone know of any examples of apps doing this?  Or is this just not possible without having the user also supply a password?
```js
  const payer = Keypair.fromSecretKey(
    Uint8Array.from(
      wallet.secret_key
    )
  )

  const token = new splToken.Token(connection, mint, splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, payer)

  const toTokenAccount = await token.getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo(
    payer.publicKey,
  )

  console.log(toTokenAccount)

Hey everyone, is anyone familiar with the candy machine cli?
I'll fiddle with it some more, I must be doing something wrong, this produces the right output 

```rust
#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, PartialEq, Debug)]
struct A {
    x: u32,
    y: u32,
}

fn test_simple_struct() {
    let a = A {
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
    };
//     let a = "liber primus primus".to_string();
    let encoded_a = a.try_to_vec().unwrap();
    let decoded_a = A::try_from_slice(&encoded_a).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}, {:?}", encoded_a, decoded_a);
    assert_eq!(a, decoded_a);
}
```

`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], A { x: 0, y: 0 }`
I was running the rust test
How you test it? write a rust test or use js to test?
all data you can treat them as uint8 array.
about string size, it depends on how you implement your serialize func. if you use borsh, it will add a extra u32 to represent string size, so the size is (u32 + your string)
ok, I tried adding another key to `GreetingAccount` and then making data in the test have eight zeros, but it bonked with ""Unexpected length of input"
1. in order.
2. yes, u32 take 4 bytes, also it is little endian, so if is 1, it will be 1, 0, 0, 0
I'm not a python dev but I think the concept in solana is the same. here are some solana/web3 examples I think you can translate it into python. https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/README.en.md
what does it does it do if there is more than one key? And is a u32 of zero represented by that vec of four zeros?
Hello there. I'm trying to airdrop tokens on the devnet to a phantom wallet, but the tokens dont seem to be landing..
It knows how to deserialize `GreetingAccount` because it knows how to deserialize a `u32` from a slice of bytes.
If I go with a string , should I assume it will come in as ASCII from the client and account for space that way ?
how does `try_from_slice` work? It looks like in the hello world test that it gets called with a slice as its argument. Does it build a struct passing each element of the slice to the keys of the struct in order?

I found what's the issue
What's the Uint8Array representation in BufferLayout?
What does the string represent? Clearly you think a u32 can do the job and the least amount of space you allocate to an account the cheaper it is. However; data vs. function is always something that needs some consideration. If using a u32 has the side effect of causing the sucking up many execution units, then a larger data space with a string may be cheaper in the long run.
Hi guys... I was wondering if there's a senior python dev who could kindly point me in the right direction as I try to wrap my head around the solana-py docs. 

I'm having a hard time figuring out how transactions and transaction instructions are built in python with web3.üò≠ 
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
tried with hardcoded values as well
I found the structure but my expectedAmount buffer is always 0 üò¶
probably use APIs of whatever marketplace you want to get the price from
just rust analyzer
What size would I assign to a string in my program . Should I use u32 instead of trying to set it as a string?
Hey guys, I'm working through the Anchor tutorials in VS code. Apart from the Rust extension, are there any VS code extensions I could use to make things easier? I had a quick search and couldn't find anything

But I keep running into the error `Account data resizing not supported yet` even though the PDA account has never been created before. Is there something I am missing?
tldr; there should be no accounts with `AToken...` assigned as the native account owner
The ATA program only owns the _address space_ of an ATA SPL Token account.  The SPL Token program still owns the SPL Token account's native account.  Otherwise they'd be incompatible with other SPL Token accounts

Hi
Ok, let me try
yes that is what the original debit/credit lamports function i sent above is, I believe.   it debits from the program account, and credits to another account.  you just need the key of the account to give/transfer the lamports to. either way you just need the key of the account your sending to, and you need authorization from the account your sending/transferring/debiting from.
I found what i want
But is it possible transfer sol from program (smart cintract) to an other wallet ? I mean is program can have sol balane ?
i dont think `bounce_check()` or `second_thoughts_refund()` exists for deployments.  Id test in local, dev, and trial run as much as possible to avoid that desire.
Thank you, I already watched `onAccountChange` but nothing about transactions :/
I'll certainly do a setTimeout and use `getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2` , not very clean to me but ..
ahh thought thats what you meant, I dont believe there is anyway to subscribe to 'all transactions' per say.  There are other ways to get updates in general. `onAccountChange` for example. based on needs. you can see the list of whats available here starting with `on`  https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html
in general, solana explorer is a 'great' resource for seeing the layout/info of the data for decoding:  searching on `AccountInfo` and `Layout` 
https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer
It looks to be for specific signatures and not trigger on all signatures of an account :/
is it possible to undeploy a program and get a refund lol
Ok thank you
there are lots of examples in the SPL and Solana core for both:  just search the source on the above and ull find something useful, and likely many other useful things.
this is an alternate method, if you own the account.  what is your scenario?
I read this before
But it's not use system_instruction::transfer

3: r {span: 8, property: 'expectedAmount', length: 8}
```
what is the data structure
hey guys any sources how to decode Account Data?
Thanks, is there any example ?
native Solana is lamports, you can transfer lamports without using the SPL-Token program.  you can use `system_instruction::transfer` for native or  `spl_token::instruction::transfer` for tokens.   to use SPL-Token with SOL, you can also wrap/unwrap SOL using native mint, affectively WSOL to use SPL-Token operations and treat it like normal token.
what's a good way to serialize and pass a string to a program and then deserialize it?

1. Serialize in client

hey so I need the finishing touch on my smart contract, I need to sign it with the recipient wallet, what are the steps to do that client side in a safe way? If the recipient wallet signs the client side could use that signature to run a malicious transaction right?
I'm trying to do this all via JS on localhost. Specific example is i'm trying to integrate with switchboard oracle.
It's a good practice to have a transaction with 2 instructions at once:
1. Create the program account, with program as owner
2. Initialize the account, with a program that recognizes an initialization instruction,  and include any data you want to instantiate the account with in this instruction
For example (in Rust): https://github.com/hashblock/solana-cli-program-template/blob/main/src/utils/txn_utils.rs#L93
I'm basically trying to create account mocks that I can use in my unit tests. I want to dump raw data into an account then pass that accountPubkey into my program. When my program parses the accountInfo, I can have mocked any data in there from my unit tests.
Hehe, Just noticed this is mentioned in <#749579745645166592>, I changed from wifi to mobile internet and it worked.
I'm not seeing in that example where it serialized the data and sets it? It only serialized the data to calculate the length?
The account has around 5.5 sol, you would think that would cover the cost

Error: RPC request error: cluster version query failed: error sending request for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com/): error trying to connect: dns error: failed to lookup address information: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
it might mean your mainnet account does not have enough SOL to deploy?
Is there a good way to get more information out of this error <@!445425471027544095> "Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x1" Deploy works on Devnet but always fails on mainnet. I tried almost every version of the CLI.
No , you can do it all from JS . Checkout the tutorial Taco sent . They do exactly what you want
it depends. and within your program? in general, in rust, there are functions to get len like `get_packed_len`, `get_packed_` if you have an instance, in borsh, there is also a `get_instance_packed_len`. It depends on what you have, what you can use, and what you desire.
Yeah, but using my own on-chain program or an existing one? Was hoping to do this just in JS on the client for some testing...
I might be wrong but maybe the HelloWorld program does this with the GreetingAccount:
https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/master/src/client/hello_world.ts#L81
I think you can create an object with the data you want to pass then Serialize it using borsh or serde then pass it into your account
I was looking in the SystemProgram, bud didn't see an option.
Is there a way using the JS Web3 package to create an account and initialize it with uint8[] of data? or can you only allocate the size?
hey guys, how can I fetch these fields programmatically?
What‚Äôs the cleanest way of getting the size of my programs state . I‚Äôve seen it done a few different ways . The first way is to creat a vec with some filler data and get the slice array length but this seems wrong . I‚Äôve also seen where the size is calculated manually by adding the bit size of all values for the account but this seems cumbersome, would like to see a programmatic way of doing this .

Anyone know where the function unpack_unchecked comes from in the solana-escrow project(https://github.com/paul-schaaf/solana-escrow/) i.e.
 `let mut escrow_info = Escrow::unpack_unchecked(&escrow_account.data.borrow())?;`
The project has no other references to it.
maybe try removing your target directory entirely and retry?  `rm -rf /home/donkey/Documents/solana-program-library/target`

what abt local?
If it's TestNet or DevNet you can Airdrop 1 sol for testing purpose.

Hello! Could anyone help me, How to get the KeyPair from a MnemonicWords using Ed25519-Bip32?
Thank you for your help with the PDA stuff, I was able to get mine working! üôÇ

<@!95652275430633472> here is a lightweight compilable example:
https://bitbucket.org/JacksonJack/helloworld-pda/src/master/src/program-rust/src/lib.rs
(look at the create_pda_account function)
Maybe the real question is, why was I trying to use `create_with_seed` when I could have just used a PDA? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah, I should of made it clear that I wanted an account owned by my program. So changing it from a `create_with_seed` account to a PDA account doesn't make much difference to me as long as I can sign for it.
Only your program can create a PDA account, because only your program can sign for a PDA account.
Here's some more info about PDA creation: https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/894737762610184273
Instead of using `create_with_seed`, I should just be using `find_program_address` to find a pubkey and then initializing that account with the regular `create_account` instruction?
Oh, okay. So I should be able to use `invoke` with a create_with_seed account but I wouldn't be able to do an `invoke_signed`?
The terminology is a little misleading here üòï
First create_with_seed accounts existed, later PDAs were added
Correct, it can't be a signer for `invoke_signed()`.  Of course it can still be used as a normal, unsigned account in this situation
So any account created with the `create_account_with_seed` instruction from system_instruction can't be used with `invoke_signed`?
In short, you can't.  `invoke_signed()` only works with PDA signers.  The system program's "create_with_seed"  accounts aren't compatible
Are there any examples of calling `invoke_signed` with a pubkey that was created using `create_with_seed`? I'm struggling to get it to work with the signer seeds.
Hey guys, which address this NFT is in at the moment, how do I check? https://explorer.solana.com/address/5PbTmV7LLS34Didg4MPeW7tn5jv8ydcY1J3dgdpsk86w/transfers
Or write to the account's data
Okay, Thanks.
yeh another way of saying you can't debit an account the program doesn't own
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/runtime#policy
An account not assigned to the program cannot have its balance decrease.
assigned means owned here?
there is a workaround though
basicaly I'm getting bodied and it's fine, no worries ü•≤
And even more so when they use it to stake a validator, then abandon it
as an account in the account infos & the signature being the authority seeds
no worries, just wanna encourage people to instead let us know if/when the current limit is no good for normal work.  happy to even increase the devnet faucet limit to 1000 or more if there's a real need.  The amount doesn't matter, it's just super annoying when some idiot drains the faucet fully
<@!445425471027544095> sorry for that. wont happen again. just got carried away.
It's stuff like this that'll make us lock down the devnet faucet again.  Please don't ruin it for everybody
<:trollface:552227154390286376> I wrote a short script to fetch sol tokens. I think there's a 24 hour bad after 200 tokens (or number of requests. I am not sure.) 

But now I am rich on the devnet!
But it should work after this, will try that later
Yes I just had to look up how to open two terminals with WSL, there‚Äôs a special trick for it
They put a governor on Devnet due to debauchery :)... 1 SOL per request I believe. There may also be a request per `time` constraint as well....
Use 2 terminals or 2 tabs in a terminal.
I‚Äôll see how I can open a new window with WSL thanks
guys is there a limit to how many sol tokens I can get using the requestAirdrop method (On the Dev net)?
Interesting
but those values makes no sense,
No need, you always get data like this, of course you need to parse BNs
If the data is being borsh serialized, after decoding shouldn't you borsh deserialize? I'm presuming the instruction data is `[instruction][data]` layout or something similar?
Instructions seems to correlate fine, but when I try to decode given the above layout, data makes no sense
So they say! üôÇ
and finally getting the first byte of the array to detect the instruction based on the mapper like this:
```switch (INSTRUCTION_MAPPER[data[0]]) {```
then I decode base58 data field on the tx like so:
```let data = bs58.decode(_instruction.data);```
And this instruction mapper:
```
const INSTRUCTION_MAPPER = {
  0: "InitializeMint",
  1: "InitializeAccount",
  2: "InitializeMultisig",
  3: "Transfer",
  4: "Approve", 
  5: "Revoke",
  6: "SetAuthority",
  7: "MintTo",
  8: "Burn",
};```

Been using this:
Hi guys, thanks in advance for support. I'm having this problem, sure it is a n00b question, but trying to decode the "data" instruction from RPC call, and given that I know that the instruction is MintTo can't seem to find proper instruction to decode base58 data
solana really cool
tysm idk why i didnt have that realization sooner
because the pda stores the data itself on chain
So you can just pass a pda and next_account_info on it
üôÇ
holy shit
Wait I just realized when I looked at my own code and was passing in a system_program
No, the accounts passed into a program are not _*limited*_ to only accounts the program owns.
Accounts passed into the program are always accounts owned by that program though is it not? Sorry if i'm not explaining it well I will try to give a small scenario.

I have a config program that creates config accounts associated to a main account in another program, I want to pass the PDA of a config account program to that main program and read the config account data. Is there a function to do this, similar to `invoke()` on chain to invoke instructions
Gotcha mate, thank you
This kills the validator
Don't bother. Use WSL with Ubuntu. At some point the core team may put the energy into making Windows a first class citizen üôÇ
Check to see if you have multiple `solana-test-validators` running first
I'm trying to install solana CLI tools on windows but upon running `C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe v1.7.14`
it just returns `The system cannot execute the specified program.`
```rust
let account_i_want_to_read = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
let mut account_data_i_want_to_read = account_i_want_to_read.data.borrow();
// Deserialize 'account_data_i_want_to_read'
```
Hmm.. I‚Äôm on WSL so I didn‚Äôt think of opening another terminal, but it seemed that just doing Ctrl+C the validatoe was still progressing in the background ü§î
How can I read that account from on chain from another program, essentially `invoke()` but for a read
The 'ownership' of the account enables the ability to 'write' data to the account, I can read the data from any account I want even if I'm not the owning program. Not sure if I'm missing some nuance of what your use case is.
You should start by trying the account as per the `solana config get` result
Is that correct?
So, starting from scratch you:
```bash
# In on terminal
solana-test-validator
# In another terminal
solana account <A VALID ACCOUNT>
```
So anyone has a solution to this? I do have a validator running.
Thanks for the reply, trying to conceptualize how to do this in my head. I want to pass a seed or a pda to a program (that doesn't own that pda), and use that pda to read the account info from another program. Is that possible? I think the answer is doing this in reverse (invoking from the account that owns the pda and sending that data to prove it's authenticity if it's not)
First error trying to deploy a program:
`Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 0: account data too small for instruction`
Any ideas?
Yes, if you pass the account in the transaction you can, at a minimum, 'read' that accounts data (if it is serialized you must know how to deserialize). If that account is on your program owns you can also 'write' to that accounts data.
hey is it possible to read a program's account data via another program? (like query it on chain)
no , but that sounds promising ‚ù§Ô∏è
did you try with GetParsedCofirmedTransaction?
explorer.solana.com displays transactions in both the hex and JSON format so i'm assuming there's a way to get the JSON. but if not, is there some other way i'm missing, to get this information?

i can already verify that there are 3 accountKeys, that the program ID is SystemProgram, etc. but i would love to verify that there is a single "transfer" instruction and know the amount
is this the place to ask questions about using solana's web3? i'm trying to use JS to verify that a TX hash refers to a simple SOL transfer, but i'm having trouble at the step of decoding the  instruction data into a readable format so that i can get the lamports and check that the "type" = transfer
Hello guys, need your help.
I am trying to make a swap with anchor with my custom swap program. I tried to do everything as it is in test but anyway I recieve this kind of error of processing instructions:
```
Error processing instruction 3: Custom program error 0xa1
``` which is error code 161 and message "No 8 byte descriminator was found on the account". There is some problem with data account but I don't even know to to correctly debug it. Any ideas what can cause this error in swap txn.
how are you passing it in?
I think it expects an account
yeah, but it's not working
If you need to sign for a PDA then you use invoked_signed and use the seeds instead of a private key
the verified flag basically means it's been signed for
hey so I've got a question regarding the token meta data program: I've got this vec of creators 
```pub struct Creator {
    pub address: Pubkey,
    pub verified: bool,
    pub share: u8,
}```
 I want to set one of the creator's to be a PDA of my program, I am already creating the authority seeds for it, but when I pass it in I get an error saying they must sign. But I can't pass the account in with is_signer: true. any thoughts?
I have one running, it still doesn't work :/
It's quite different compared to ETH I guess, where you can only mint if you have funds
I'm pasting this in a new python file as a guideline üòâ
and that is the wallet I use
hit the faucet for 5 sol
I've generated a wallet, that I also use in phantom.
So what's happened is the account is already funded (or has an owner). 

You could add a check that checks if the account exists and only run that line if it doesn't and needs created.
here's how the work flow should work in your transaction / program
> create mint account
> create token account
> create mint (into mint account)
> create token (into token account)
> mint into token account
(I'm one week into solana üòÑ have experience with waves protocol and eth)
or should I generate a fresh account when minting?
I'm trying to wrap my head around it.  üôÇ
before I call mint_to I call mint = tokenClient.create_mint
or created it an another execution of the program?
have you created this account earlier in the program?
<@!793009052879028254> üß†
Address is already use.
the 'account address .. { } already in use'
this is the entire thing
```{'code': -32002, 'message': 'Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x0', 'data':

Traceback (most recent call last):```
Im talking like 3-4 lines up
if you scroll up do you see a more regular error output?
So: I'm talking to solana and trying to create and then mint a token.
When I issue mint_to I get this error
```Allocate: account Address { address: <myAddress>, base: None } already in use', 'Program 11111111111111111111111111111111 failed: custom program error: 0x0', ```
I'm not sure how I should interpret this, I've tried several wallets and also generated token addresses that I've passed to the function.

I'm using solana-py.

Any ideas / pushes in the right direction? üôÇ
