aren't solana programs open source?
I have a really basic question that i am unable to answer:
Is there a way to see the code of programs on the chain? Like it is possible to see contracts on etherscan for example?
for code, the github for solana-program-library should have most everything you need sample-wise for tokens, accounts, minting.  https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token, oyster also has great examples: https://github.com/solana-labs?q=oyster&type=&language=&sort=.  reviewing the tests, and js files you should be able to see how to accomplish most things token related you want, and follow the calls to the instructions and the program files.  search on 'mint'
In a program or from a rust client?
Pls help i am on a deadline
In initialise mint what do i have to pass in mint_public_key
How to create a token using spl_token rust?
can anyone provide a good code sample
somebody knows?
If you have the source code, yes

<@!509814124306497537>  I'll look into it Thanks 🙂
if i have an address of a program, how can i see what instructions the program can accept? How can i see what interactions i can perform against said program?
I see. They have an example code here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/examples/create_mint_and_transfer_tokens.js#L44

Hello, i am already embarrased to ask, but i get this error when i am trying to set up devnet in config
You can use that command multiple times to increase the supply
https://spl.solana.com/token#example-creating-your-own-fungible-token you can run `spl-token mint {your token address} 100`
Hey, I am pretty new to solana and this might be a beginner's question. I am trying to make a token using solana/spl-token and solana/web3.js libraries and couldn't figure out how we can increase the supply for a Token. Can anyone help me please 🙂
Yeah, it'd have to be open source
Quick question: I'm thinking about creating web2 Backend that accesses Solana blockchain using solana/web3 on Node. Is there a good practice to store key pairs? Where would be the best place to store key pairs if we want to hold multiple accounts?
do people publish their precompiled code somewhere
is there a way to look at source code for programs similar to looking at source code for verified smart contracts on etherscan? doesnt look like it but maybe im missing something
Did anyone had used the name service from spl ?
Can someone guide me on how to create a registry and retrive it ??
just installed everything. reinstalled Solana as well. Cargo build is working fine. Problem is with cargo build -bpf
Make sure Rust isn’t out of date. Update it and also  try reinstalling the Solana tools
Getting this error when using cargo build-bpf:

Hi - is it current possible to verify deployed smart contract code on Solana? (e.g. through a block explorer like etherscan for ethereum? or some other way?)
I’ve actually come across this, but I’m still confused because I have see some sol nfts where I get the token address and it is not in the json file. These nfts also have metadata fields which are different than the fields in the token-list json file. Here’s an example of an nft. If you click on the metadata dropdown it will show you the json key value attributes https://nfteyez.global/accounts/AFP4z7uudd6Yj1cwja8zvdLUCJvbSux957ocFM1QykhH/sol/2wuRuEWs4QUKzHirQLeJMryYcYNvjR97nyKMbpYz2rvt
32 base58 encoded bytes can be anywhere from 32-44char
No,  that is not at all what BIP44 is
Submit a pr 😅 https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list#adding-new-token
You can use the cli tools to inspect blocks, there's also this for metrics: https://metrics.solana.com:3000/d/monitor-beta/cluster-telemetry-beta?orgId=2&refresh=10s&var-testnet=mainnet-beta, stuff that can change can include network delays, messing up your slot, etc
Hello. Can anyone help me or point me in the right direction with adding/configuring metadata on spl-tokens?
Right but that only shows me for the last minute or hour.  Trying to understand if there are conditions in which it changes dramatically
You can see 1min and 1hour average on the explorer: https://explorer.solana.com/
Only if the account data is zeroed out
Does it change in times of stress
anyone here know how stable blocktimes are?  I think blocks are roughly 400ms but how much can they vary around that?

yes. technically you can but the solana's program model is different with ethereum. I think you can take a look at https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/overview
then think is it still property

thank you a lot frank!
it works perfectly fine now
that was it
that must be it
i don't correctly encode the length of the string on the rust side
i think i got what the problem is
oh
https://spl.solana.com/token#non-fungible-tokens
on the rust side
pub struct Trove {
    pub is_initialized: bool,
    pub coll: u64,
    pub debt: u64,
    pub lusd_wallet_key_len: u32,
    pub lusd_wallet_key: String,
}
this is the equivallent
individual fields
are the `coll` `debt` and `used_wallet_key` serialized in the program as a structure or individual field?
i'm thinking if i need a structure for serialising and a structure for deserialising...
ohh, all right then
I'm yet to actually find what the metadata format even looks like
I'm no good on helping in the react side
but the deserialisation still fails
<@!693486673606082580> i've already looked at this, doesn't cover the minting process, give the format of the metadata or anything of the sorts
53 of bytes are coming back from rust
53 bytes of data get sent to rust (1 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 32)
const TroveSchema = new Map([
  [Trove, {kind: 'struct', fields: [['is_initialized', 'u8'],
                                    ['coll', 'u64'],
                                    ['debt', 'u64'],
                                    ['lusd_wallet_key', 'string']]}],
]);
this is my schema
in react i have problems with serialising/deserialising the same thing
https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html
in rust everything works as expected
i think the problem is in the react code, not in rust
I know we went through that a couple builds back, I thought you removed that. I'll have the team resign, but I don't recall doing that for my solo test. I'll get back to you.
Hey guys! I'm looking to make a Solana Program for a NFT collection, basically the same concept as you would with Ethereum and Solidity, however I'm really really struggling to actually find any documentation to do the things I want it to do which is making it incredibly difficult for me to even begin to know where to start. Can someone please give me some pointers, I really want to ditch Ethereum but this does so far seem so so much more complicated to get started with
How much space did you allocate for the account with state?
The thing is, you can't `deserialize` and just give it the raw start of the data [u8] as borsh checks the size (in the first 4 bytes) with the length of the src [u8] you pass in. You need to slice the src [u8] first

Finally, you can not modify an account's state outside of the Program as it is a copy and will not reflect in the accounts true state

Here is a sample (using a BTreeMap to store in account state) how I capture the serialize length in a separate area in the allocated state. Fetching that first and using it to 'slice' the data area then pass that into deserialize works: https://github.com/hashblock/solana-cli-program-template/blob/main/shared/src/lib.rs
Hi How to create a new Solana wallet address using Python or web3 ?
👋
hello
anyone here?
hey!!
I tried deploying this ... https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/js .. and I'm getting this error.
Please help!!!!
keep getting  Unexpected 32 bytes after deserialized data when deserializing with borsh
yep doesn't work...
but i'm not sure how can you modify it
i see you can only get it with await connection.getAccountInfo(<pubkey>).data;
also, do you know how can you modify the account data from react?
i'll try it out now thank you a lot frank!
If you, in react, get Account Info and want to confirm the data you put in the account state space, deserialize it ln Borsh/JS the same way you would in Pack
you can't send bytes from Solana Program to react
serialize/deserialze work in tandem... if you serialize in react and send it in data to Solana Rust Program to deserialize DO NOT remove any bytes
in rust, i should remove those 4, and only send 32 bytes of string back to react?
so for example if i send 32 bytes of string, it will actually send 36
if i send a string from react to rust should i get rid of those 4 bytes of data?
but on the last one I get: Uncaught (in promise) Error: Unexpected 32 bytes after deserialized data
    at Object.deserialize
is_initialized and coll and debt are deserialised fine,
i'm having this structure
class Trove {
  is_initialized = 0;
  coll = 0;
  debt = 0;
  lusd_wallet_key = "11111111111111111111111111111111";
it's the same?
what about deserialising a string?
and i still couldn't get it
took me forever to dig into the errors
better then serde which used 8 bytes to cpture size
omg really?????
which should be = 2
so 2 char string = 6 bytes array where first 4 bytes are little endian size
That is because borsh serialized... the first 4 bytes are the size of the string which is 32 bytes
i have a 32 characters strings but when i send it, i receive a 36 characters string
i'm having issues with this... it seems that borsh adds unwanted characters
hey frank, more like sending it from react using borsh and then unpacking it in Rust with solana_program::program_pack::Pack
make sure you pick the right environment on the top right
paste your program id in the search box

If so
```rust
// Serialize
let ser_string = String::try_to_vec(&my_string).unwrap();

// Deserialize
let my_string = String::try_from_slice(&ser_string)?;
```
In Rust?
Hi this may sounds like a dump q but how do we view deployed contract/program on sol like what we did on etherscan
so you mean having an [u8] array instead of String?
the devnet is quite slow atm, are there any upgrades running?
otherwise I'd keep an enum and serialize it to an int
if you know the size of the string I'd keep a fixed array of bytes
does anyone know the question?
or web3 ?
?
How to create a new Solana wallet address using Python
Hi all
yes indeed...
serialization and serialization is the hardest part
i keep getting errors that the data is invalid
i ve tried it myself but something is not working right
okay. let me try it
I also need it.
setup wsl and ubuntu
hi do we have any examples for using borsh serialization/deserialization with a string?
okay so how can i initialize simple hello world example on windows?
You'd have to fetch the transaction history from somewhere, which comes out to quite a bit of data.  There's some interesting info over at https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/rpc-transaction-history
If you are trying to run rust build on windows, it can't happen on windows
Hey, <@!433163869851222016> do i have to configure anything after installing LLVM? because its still not working.
no typescript method for this sendandconfirmtransaction?
so, I can't start a node on my machine that will have entire history, from genesis till now?
ok let me install it
bro install llvm it will fix automatically
can someone please help me why i'm getting this error?
the main difference is voting vs non-voting, as seen in that link above ^ if you need full transaction history, you'll need to fetch that from another node
You can run a non-voting / RPC node if you just need chain data: https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs#rpc-node-recommendations
validator is the same as full node? Or is more? We need to access tx history
can i just run proxy node without validator? aka accessing chain data, or the only way is to be validator and stake?
Okay, thanks Jon !
Hey there, you can take a look at all the node-related docs at https://docs.solana.com/running-validator
You can look at transactions that involve the memo program: https://explorer.solana.com/address/Memo1UhkJRfHyvLMcVucJwxXeuD728EqVDDwQDxFMNo
hey, how can I start a full node on my machine? thanks
Got the id
Yeah I am also able to see the msg in the explorer, with my test case
And I did a little test, maybe the memo wasn't included? https://explorer.solana.com/tx/5RePdio6eKHSJjPmhVrPscrtG4w4eoa68PgKF1TksotT7yLmNvvf9ocuXbTtdvmnUcd1FtWZfCAdgeeq79E7boyJ?cluster=devnet
it could be a legacy thing, not too sure to be honest
Then why getsignatureforaddress method claims to return the memo <string | null>??
savvy?
in your example, it would be 3 accounts versus the 2 in the sample
Hm, now that i'm looking at the code, it seems like the memo will never be populated.  Can you fetch the transaction using `getTransaction` and find it in there somewhere? https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
The key is that the accounts 'balance' or the validation will fail the txn
This is from a sample program that uses key/value "pairs" as the item of transfer
It would be for buy/sell instructions (there may be more instructions in the program). The above snippet is called, for example:
```rust
fn transfer_keypair_to_account_with_fee(accounts: &[AccountInfo], key: String) -> ProgramResult {
    let account_info_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let from_account = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
    let to_account = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
    let service_account = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;

    // Cost to "from account"
    charge_service_fee(
        from_account,
        service_account,
        SampleServiceFees::Transfering as u64,
    )?;
    // Cost to "to account"
    charge_service_fee(
        to_account,
        service_account,
        SampleServiceFees::Minting as u64,
    )?;
    // Invoke the actual transfer
    transfer_keypair_to_account(accounts, key)?;
    Ok(())
}
```
so this is debited on every transaction?
I didnt know we could do that
Thank you
Ah
<@!828385808260005940> Small snippet of taxing one account and paying another in Rust program
```rust
/// Extracts the service fee from the users program account and
/// credits the service account
fn charge_service_fee(

    amount: u64,
) -> ProgramResult {
    // If tracking can not afford transaction fee
    if **program_account.try_borrow_lamports()? < amount {
        return Err(SampleError::InsufficientFundsForTransaction.into());
    }
    // Debit user and credit service
    **program_account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? -= amount;
    **service_account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? += amount;

}
```
did i missconfigure something? <@!780128909597212682>
Have you tried using one of the `getSignaturesForAddress` functions? looks like that will give you the memo from the transaction too https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress
Just guessing but I think they are saying they want the Program, on each buy/sell, to tax % of SOL/lamports based on buy/sell amount. This is possible for the program to do but would require including those accounts (current holder, marketing and development) to be included in the accounts for the transactions.

Hi does anyone have any idea what this man is on about
<@539801435571748868>  please help !?
Thank you that's what I though.. Many thanks again
Hm, that'll be tricky and take some time. you'd have to find out the mints of all NFTs first, and if you're going for ALL NFT mints, that might be a huge amount.  You'll have to use `getProgramAccounts` multiple times, once to fetch all mints that only have a supply of 1, and then a few other times to get the token accounts themselves, and then extract the owner from there
You can look at the CLI code itself if you want at https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/cli/src
Or use `solana -h` to learn more about the commands available
Thanks! I'm on it since hours but I can't find the right method.. I would like to get the addresses of every wallet that own at least one NFT. But I can't figure it out
Not really unfortunately, unless you have a deterministic way of generating all of the stake addresses. The `solana-stake-accounts` tool was meant to help with this, but it's not particularly supported.  You can try to resurrect it! https://docs.solana.com/cli/manage-stake-accounts has some info, and the code is at https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/stake-accounts/src
Hello, I am trying to delegate the tokens stored in an account. How can i do so? I have created the account with createAccountWithSeed (https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/StakeProgram.html#createAccountWithSeed). When I checked the account balance. It already shows balance more than i initially funded. I am on Devnet is this behaviour builtin? Also how can i avoid or check the lockup period?
Of course! You can take a look at all of the RPC endpoints over at https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api
You're best off asking in the metaplex discord, they'll be able to help you more: https://discord.gg/HyRSJXUF
when you are creating account for program, is it possible to pass values that should be populated into data, instead of data account being created with default values?
you actually have to create it as such
i finally got it...
You can follow how metaplex does things for metadata, here's the docs [1] and the program [2]

Hi, folks! Is there any workaround to avoid calling `getProgrammAccount` to get all owned stake addresses for specified address? 
Issue is that `getProgramAccount` consuming a lot node resources and causes noticeable performance drop even with enabled indexing
Thank you, can you lead me to some documentations about this? So far I've only found Metaplex but the implementation is kind of too complicated. I've noticed that a lot of project have been using Arweave to store the metadata but I'm not quite clear about how arweave data associated or linked with the actual SLP token on the Solana blockchain.

You can use new PublicKey(string of public key ) from the solana web3 library with the key as a string
my path is solana/bin/solana.exe <@!780128909597212682>
can i not create the public key from the key as a string?
have you set the correct path?
if i put those in the code, i mean that is major risk
have to supply the seed / secret key

is there no way to retrieve the keypair using the publickey?
Yeah I do understand that,
I am using public key as a identifier
I am asking it is a possibility that a account having some public key deleted 2 years ago by system because of low balance  has a same public key as a new account create today
so any alternative for that?
for SOL address, you don't need to wait to solana deletes your account. if someone has a same private key of your pubkey, he can also operate your pubkey.
for now you can only read the contract which open source.
there are some commands cannot used in windows. like `solana-test-validator`
that's most likely you have not enough SOL to deploy program.
before you deploy, you can use `solana balance` to check your balance
and check which network you are deploying.
Hey, i just installed solana-cli but when i run command solana from outside of the bin folder it says 'solana' is not recognized as an internal or external command, i edited my env variables but still getting same error can anyone help me please? i'm using windows 10
can anyone help?

how can y view the code of a smart contract?
I think not, just confirming.
Hey,

Hi guys. I am trying to write unit tests for the escrow program (https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/). My plan is to create some fake Accounts and AccountInfos as the input to test the Processor::process() function. For Solana system account, I wrote
let mut initializer_account_data = vec![];
        let mut initializer_account_lamport = account_minimum_balance();

        let initializer_account_info = 
            AccountInfo::new(
                &account_key,
                true,
                false,
                &mut initializer_account_lamport,

hey all, are there any simple working examples of using the `@project-serum/anchor` ts sdk with the `@solana/wallet-adapter` React components? can't seem to get it quite right and looking for a reference
Take a look at this: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jZ9kVo6hnhBsz3D2sywqpMojqLE5VTZtaXna7OHL1Uk/edit#slide=id.ge15c343642_0_51
I think you need to pass `--recipient-is-ata-owner` for the `--sign-only` cases
What are the recommended tools and techniques for Solana Contract Audit
looking at this. the only thing is it doesn't even use the wallet address, just the mint address

I'm trying to transfer a spl-token from a multisig but I'm keep having the same error several times
Hi guys
not pretty sure but I guess your wallet convert your address to associated token address
more info here https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account
Hey another noob question. Based on a mint address(XXX) my wallet is making a request to getAccountInfo. but it is doing it with a different address(YYY). my question is. how did it get this new address. is it there some kind of encoding function?
it does not make any more requests but I am very confused how it got the second address (YYY)
Calling out for SOL Devs in generating unique NFTs based out of PIXELATED 3D VOX and upcoming only METAVERSE in SOLANA interested Devs please DM me
Thanks!
it uses a little more than _just_ ed25519 for the derivation stuff
<@423902793644900364> i dont know ruby so i won't be much help there, but my suggestion would be trying to replicate the typescript keypair implementation here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/master/src/keypair.ts
I found this one https://github.com/RubyCrypto/ed25519 but couldn't figure out how to extract private and public keys.
you'd need `Connection#getTokenAccountsByOwner` to get the token accounts owned by a certain address and then you can pipe the token account addresses into the `spl-token` implementation of `getAccountInfo` which should provide usable metadata about that account
there are some nice functions in the `@solana/spl-token` package for parsing the encoded data on accounts and making it usable
what i am stuck on is that if i just list transactions on that mint address, i can find the data on the fourth txn. but there's gonna be a better way to do it
JS
json-rpc to http://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
what language
i am working on an nft ui
you can use this as a reference to get it done https://www.quicknode.com/guides/web3-sdks/how-to-send-a-transaction-on-solana-using-javascript
i have tried getProgramAccounts on mint address, and getAccountInfo from there
how do i get metadata of a Solana SPL token from it's mint address
if its not in that sdk, you'll need to find an ed25519 and base58 gem to utilize
How can I create a public and private key pairs compatible with Solana accounts with Ruby? They should be ed25519 key pairs?
Hey folks, apologies if this has already been answered elsewhere; we're trying to create a tx using `@solana/web3.js` which is equivalent to calling `withdraw-from-vote-account` in the CLI (https://docs.solana.com/cli/usage#solana-withdraw-from-vote-account)

Haven't been able to find this in the web3 lib, anyone know if this is possible?
or https://github.com/project-serum/sol-wallet-adapter
https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter
Is there a tutorial for connecting external solana wallet in a frontend. Eg. user clicks "Connect" button on website and is then able to connect to Phantom, solflare wallets etc. 

Analogous to what web3modal package is doing in the ethereum ecosystem.
There's several listed here: https://solana.com/developers
i can't find it atm though
somewhere in the solana docs there is a list of community SDKs for several languages
If you're using Ruby, have you look into this? https://github.com/Block-Logic/solana-rpc-ruby
Actually, I try to test Solana with Ruby and try to create a deposit account. That's why I am wondering how to create an account without using web3.js API
Bump, in case someone could provide some insight. It would be much appreciated
Thanks, trying it out now.
might need a call to get the minter account details for the minted amount validation
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L762
going to have to be a weird mix of `Connection#getTokenAccountsByOwner` from `@solana/web3.js` and `getAccountInfo` from `@solana/spl-token` which does the token account metadata parsing so you can check how many of that token type have been minted
<@!168868665456984065> any idea as to how to get NFT data in solana ?
depends on what data. the `@solana/spl-token` package has some nice utility functions that do data parsing for you, but other than that not too sure off the top of my head
any way to parse data locally instead of calling the above method in api? like an ABI would in EVM
called getParsedConfirmedTransaction
theres a method in the web3 library
found a solution
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getTransaction
the `Connection#getTransaction` function only supports JSON encoding. there is no option for changing that
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction here's the docs for the method
I'm trying to change the encoding of the return object, i've tried base64, jsonParsed and it doesn't seem to change anything
```
  const txInfo = await connection.getTransaction("5qhn2YVd6ehWcm9esE64pNQzaMEEW4Dk4XH2V1xZcpTCN9iE4hbtKLhggunjBsqWsPqPC8qvJcckdahp6P6FU8Se", {encoding: "base64"})```
ive got another question
oops! thank you
How can I use solana-web3 to see the contents of a user address ? like what all NFTs they own etc https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/

I found a link to the examples directory in the docs, but it only contain information on creating and transfering tokens and not on reading tokens from user's wallet. https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/js/examples
that document is geared towards building an exchange that supports solana, meaning there are many users/consumers of the exchange and each should have their own deposit account so theres user segregation and no cross contamination
Btw, what does "We recommend using a unique deposit account for each of your users." means at documentation? Creating a new key pair for each user (which is obvious)?
https://www.quicknode.com/guides/web3-sdks/how-to-send-a-transaction-on-solana-using-javascript
this may be useful
you'll have to persist that keypair securely somehow, depending on how the dapp works
using `@solana/web3.js` you can create a new `Keypair` instance to create a fresh keypair or a derivation of another one and then airdrop it some sol
Has anyone working on a
Name service program ?
I am facing this error
Invalid account name provided while calling the retrieve function. 
Can Anyone help ?
Documentation says that Solana accounts do not require any on-chain initialization; once they contain some SOL, they exist. To set up a deposit account for your exchange, simply generate a Solana keypair using any of our wallet tools. Actually, I am looking for something how to do the functionality of solana-keygen tool?
https://docs.solana.com/integrations/exchange#setting-up-deposit-accounts
new keypair (imo) is more or less synonymous with new account (depending on how the keypair is used) since accounts are addressed by the base58 encoding of their public key
So, creating a keypair is similar to creating an account? Once it gets SOL, it will be created as like activated.
can you explain more of the reasoning behind this? i'm hitting this error myself but it's in my own program in a test
you do need to consider the need for rent for each account though
you don't need to initialize accounts on-chain via rpc. you can locally create one using a new keypair as soon as the address receives SOL, it "exists"
It returns null if the transaction is not found or not confirmed: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
that snippet worked when i replaced the transaction signature with one i got for mainnet from the explorer. are you sure the signature you have there is on the network you're connecting to?
I am trying to create a deposit address on Solana via my application. I know that there are methods at Web3 JavaScript API. However, is there any way to achieve it via using pure JSON-RPC service?
Is there any way to get confirmed signatures for an address by timeslice? Want to get the last 24 hours of transactions for an address
it really depends on what your doing, and I believe you are more limited by size of transaction, instructions, and compute budget than anything, along with current network bandwidth.
the login process to a website is up to you, but solana wallet integration examples are here: https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter, https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold <@456226577798135808>  also examples of wallet integration, adapters, and how to make an adapter if one is currently implemented.
i am trying to use the getTransaction method, but it returns null. any ideas?

it needs to be caught up for the transactions to process. im pretty sure..hmm ... thinking out loud
did your node fall offline or something?
Hello! Last two days i'm getting this error: `failed to send transaction: Node is behind by 222 slots` when I send $SOL transaction. What's happening and how to fix that?
thanks
is there a time limit, or anyway to make sure it has the actual Token Symbol?
but it still says Unkknown
checked it on the explorer and its there
and added supply
so i got my new token created
hey whats up
How do I get the exchange rate of a specific reserve that belongs to the spl-token-lending program? (I have the spl-token-lending program as a dependency in my anchor program)
Interesting… someone help this guy
Is there a way query the state of an account after a particular transaction (say 3 transactions have happened on this account since)?
From the docs here: https://docs.solana.com/offline-signing#commands-supporting-offline-signing
it is not possible to deploy/upgrade a program with the upgrade-authority signing offline. Since the `set-upgrade-authority` also does not support offline signing, it is not possible to set the authority to an air-gapped machine.

Are there plans in the near future to support this feature?
any SPL wallet that supports Wallet Connect 2??
Hi there
Hello, how many tx/s can a simple contract handle on average? I just want an approximated number. 
If I got it correctly Solana allows txs to be processed in parallel if smart contracts change state to different resources. So a contract that keeps accessing the same resource should have lower tx/s than claimed 65k/s. What is that number?
Hi guys how I can see an NFT from the contract in a picture in case is not on my wallet but I’m curious about what was minted?
Has anyone successfully integrated with Circle?
what function do I need to use,  so that a user can claim a mint and spend 5 e.g. to claim it ? <@!712412210814779454>
looking for a rust dev to develop a generative nft. well paid gig
Any reason why using RecentBlockhashes is using all 200k compute units?
I want to develop a browser app, so yeah, will try phantom or sollet, thank you!
if you're using localhost for dev purposes, probably just best to use the web3 lib to spin up wallets on the fly as you need them. if you are looking for a ui option, phantom and sollet are probably your best bets
I see thank you
afaik, you currently cannot do this unless it's posted here: https://anchor.projectserum.com/
Hi, guys! During the last hackathon I spent enormous amount of time trying to make any wallet to sign my transaction. No luck. What is a best wallet for development today? Which can connect to my localhost solana node and sign transactions?
Noob question here, how do you obtain the source code of a program given just its address?
thanks
yeah i think that's what i will do
you can keep track of token metadata privately if you wanted to, i guess it just wouldn't show up on explorers and such (which probably isnt that big a deal tbh)
i can just use sol itself i guess
easier if there are names attached to the tokens
and move wallet to wallet
basically idea was to create tokens for various expenses as they move through stages supply chain
why is that unfortunate?
oh that's unfortunate
its community maintained
could be wrong but im pretty sure that all you need is to make a PR here: https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list
Hello! Need advice about solana wallet login to website integration. Who already do that? Give me url please
I am looking into developing on Solana and maybe I am missing something but is it possible to create a token and give it a name without having to go through some sort of application approval process? Or can I only use the normal long version and keep track of which token is what outside of it?
Sorry, for that stupid question, but is this what the output of the web3 example should look like? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/master/examples/get_account_info.js

  executable: false,
  lamports: 1000000000,
  owner: PublicKey { _bn: <BN: 0> },

}```
is there anyone here who can answer dev questions about the spl-token-lending repo? i have some very specific questions but if this isnt the right place to ask, i'd hate to spam
Are there any limits on how big I can make them?
Good day! How big should I make my transactions? Say If I wanted to create 4-5 accounts, would it be better to batch those instructions into a single transaction, or to make multiple ones
can someone help me figure out how to: 

A) look up all of the mint addresses for a given pubkey? i tried using the solana explorer api `gettokenaccountbalance` but it only ever returns 74 items

B) how do i find the metadata url associated with a given mint token pubkey?
thanks. docs in case anyone else needs it: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/program_pack.rs#L28
Lemme double check on that, it has `AccountInfo` wrapped around it
Try `getMintInfo()` in the same file?
Like I can get the spl-token address through the transaction hash
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js
I already look into the source code
I am trying to get through javascript
that's the CLI
what does the code look like your calling and expecting something back from?  To mint you need the address of the mint and be the authority, you create a token account based on the mint, and then you can mint to or transfer tokens to an account. Most of those items should be provided here, as well as the github with source code. https://spl.solana.com/token
If your referring to NFTs, I would reference metaplex for how they handle the creation, sale, and management of the NFTs themselves, and suggest using the platform itself and setup a store to see how it works. For customization youll need to produce some kind of code, to either create or integrate with a source that does create accounts, tokens, etc. You can do likely do a lot of it with the solana web3 library based on your needs. There are calls to create accounts, mint, etc.  the spl-token documents are a good starting reference. https://spl.solana.com/token, https://docs.solana.com/, and all the github resources: https://github.com/solana-labs
Need a rust dev to create SOL smart contracts to mint NFTs, please reach out if you've worked on something similar before and know how to get this done.
I am just getting the transaction hash
hey guys, I am just wondering if is possible to get the spl-token address after being minted?
the metaplex site, github, and dev docs are the best overall resources.  https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex, https://docs.metaplex.com/, https://solana.blog/solana-metaplex-tutorial-deploy-your-own-store-mint-nfts-and-setup-auctions/, after you figure out how to build a store and deploy, you can start to customize more, and or fully customize based on your needs and integrate appropriately. There is currently no step by step walk through guide for the entire customization process that I know of, but the resources and material are there for you to dive in and start figuring it out until a guide arrives.
I have a project I'm working on, and the website/art is almost done, I'm just working on some Program things and needed some clarification. For the Token SPL, I don't have to copy and paste the code or anything? I can just run it and give parameters and it will make the token? I've made a few through the cmd, it's very smooth feeling. I'm excited to learn more. I'm sure it's been asked before, and I'm going to search after this, but what is the best way to mint 10k pfp projects? Should I make a script to mint the 10k back to back? Or is there a way I can do mint on demand and connect it to my front end? Thanks for any help, I will be doing a lot of googling, cheers


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

not sure what you're talking about
Is that defined in the `[Write, signer]` flag when calling `CreateAccount`?
no PDA is only related to signing authority
Sounds like PDA is stricter than I thought. I assumed it simply meant "an account you create that is owned by a program"
in this case, maybe the AMM account doesn't need to sign for anything. It's a common pattern to have an account state list various authority addresses which do need to be PDA's and actually control the funds
yes, exactly
Wait I thought you said PDAs need to be off curve? Is the AMM account you're imagining not a PDA?
and then it doesn't matter whether that account has a private key or not, your program has full control of its state
someone could create it and assign its owner to your AMM program
for example, an AMM market account could actually have a private key
and so you don't need the account to be a PDA
many times you will store state in an account that never needs to sign for anything
> and you can chose public keys as program state accounts too
but read above for what I think you meant to ask 🙂
yes
Do program derived accounts need to be off the curve?
it's pretty common
and you can chose public keys as program state accounts too
yeah you can only tell by checking if the address is on the curve or not
Oh okay. This is another thing that confused me. I saw ed25519 pubkeys are 32 bytes so I wasn't sure what the distinction between pubkey and address was
PDA's all have to be off the curve
because they aren't, those addresses don't correspond to public keys on the ed25519 curve
yeah that's why we don't call addresses public keys
I mean they have to by definition, right? Private -> public -> address?
I think it's like half of them do
not all addresses have a corresponding private key
Well wait... every address has a corresponding private key. But I think you're saying it just isn't ever used except to derive the address?
yup
Yeah I think that's what I was asking. Like you create a program derived account whose state can be updated by anyone according to the linked program API
Cool, thanks! That's what I figured.
I think the answer is that it's up to your program, your program chooses the conditions in which it would invoke another program using a derived address
> Like the memory is allocated and then anyone can alter it using the linked program API?
Didn't quite get what you're asking here
general support -> just meaning there are many more examples, guides, and source code using and referencing rust, and likely a greater portion of the community using rust.  There are not any major issues you should encounter using C++ that I know of.
it's a runtime construct which allows programs to "sign" for an account which doesn't have a private key
Program derived addresses don't have a private key
So is the private key for a derived account actually a throw away? Like the memory is allocated and then anyone can alter it using the linked program API?
yes and these two: https://docs.metaplex.com/, https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard are great references.

It's sufficient for your program to be the owner in order mutate data and spend lamports, no signer required
On Solana, every account has an owner (program) and can store some data. Programs are just accounts that are owned the BPF loader program and store static executable byte code like you mentioned. Only the owner program can mutate account data and it can define its own rules for that. Your program state is stored across many different accounts which are owned by your program. Having a private key is not necessary to update an account, actually. It's up to each program to require that if it wishes. For example, the "system" program requires an account to be a signer in order to change the owner program of an account, send lamports, or allocate data. Your program could require an account to be a signer if it wishes, but it's not required
Hmm... It has "general support" in what way? I guess what I'm most interested in is figuring out whether I could run into any difficult issues by using C++.
Can anyone explain how Solana program state is updated? I'm coming from Ethereum where a contract has global state and transactions must be processed in serial because anyone can change state of any contract so long as there is an API to do so.

With Solana you create an "account" that references static executable program code, but as the creator of that account you have the private key and, I assume, the ability to update state?

I'm trying to map this pattern onto, for example, an AMM market. Multiple actors should be able to call on that to update state, but doesn't the owner of the program derived account (i.e. the one holding market state) have sole ability to update state? I am confused about how this works in practice.
rust def has more code examples and general support, and encouraged. its def worth learning and utilizing. and not a tough transition from C/++.
Hey, I'm starting a new smart contract project. I wanted to know if there's any reason to prefer Rust or C/++. Does it make any difference?
yeah will probably just do that. thanks though
this is exactly what I was looking for !! :))
You can create a data feed for the info you are looking to fetch.  Look at example 2 of https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/examples
thanks a million for the quick response :))
you can have another program write data to the chain before your program is called, you can look into how oracles work
not possible
Hello everyone, I need help, is it possible to call http requests from a program and even if it's possible , is it advisable to do so ?
You can just redeploy it with a new key <@!107942226952224768> ?
That program appears to not be upgradeable so I doubt the key is available.
Lets say that I had a queue of pubkeys were pubkeys were constantly being pushed and popped.  Is there a way that I can get the first 5 pubkeys in the front of the queue and load their accountInfo in another instruction in a single transaction?
what is a blockchain state in simple terms?
yeah that would be awesome. 🙏
Alternatively, you can stub out a lower level method that lets you build the instruction with an arbitrary program ID
Maybe <@!501570363566587905> knows who holds that key and could get the assert-owner program deployed on all public clusters
Ahh copy. That makes sense
Does anyone have a bash script for sending SPL-token transfers
oh sorry, I should have specified. I'm a developer at Phantom. I'm trying to fix right now that SPL token transfers don't work on devnet. The reason they don't work is that the code to make the transfer calls out to that `4MN...` program specifically. But we want to change it so that all program_ids are environment specific instead of hard-coded. So if the program was deployed to that exact address, the SPL transfers would work on devnet with no code change. If it was deployed to a different address, we can just add that address if the environment is devnet and allow SPL transfers to work on devnet
I don't quite follow, which codebase? it sounds like that address is hardcoded in the Phantom wallet
well it's possible to specify different program_ids for different chain environments in the codebase. so ideally it would be deployed at the same address, but it wouldn't be the worst if it wasn't. The other option is to circumvent the check entirely when making transfers on devnet, which I like less because then there would be different behavior on different environments
Hmm, even if we deploy, wouldn't we need control of the `4MNPdKu9wFMvEeZBMt3Eipfs5ovVWTJb31pEXDJAAxX5` account for it to work with Phantom? <@!107942226952224768>
is jordan around?
nm moved to https://api.devnet.solana.com/
I am thinking of just specifying the number of token accounts in the instruction data, and then iterate through the accounts until I have as many as were specified
Expired cert.
Are there best practices for doing this, or any pitfalls I should be aware of
For example, I am writing a simple swap program where you can specify an variable amount of token accounts to swap
Hey Hey, I've been writing smart contracts, and have a question about what is the best approach with handling a variable number of accounts?
GetProgramAccounts is a web3 API? Why would that take processing power from the node?
Thanks! That’s a bummer because it wouldn’t be a truly decentralized app
ok, thank you for the info 🙂
Thanks!
It refers to https://spl.solana.com/
In the recent Twitch stream on Anchor the presenter used the acronym SPL.  What does that mean?  I'm pretty sure it isn't Simplicity coin.
This program is here and you can deploy it to devnet if you'd like. https://github.com/project-serum/serum-dex/tree/master/assert-owner

It asserts the owner of an account is some expected address. In the event of phantom, they're likely asserting the owner of the authority of the associated token account being created is the system program.
Hi Solana development team, can you explain it to me?
What happens when the next leader is attacked or DDOS, causing it to stop working, how will the inbound transactions be handled?
Yes, the same runtime restriction as *normal* accounts applies: all desired accounts must be declared explicitly
Do PDAs on  cross program invocations need their public key to be included in the accounts of the original transaction?
nice.
Its on byte 69. encode the name in base58.
you could call getProgramAccounts with a filter. I have to look up on wich byte is the name..
public key yes
public address of a token
tokenID is what? like a name in the metadata or a publickey?
or this URI like on solscan
Lets say you know the tokenID of an NFT, how do you get the metadata from that (name, description, collection...)? I am using @solana/web3.js
as for amms you have Raydium, Saber, Orca, Serum ( not a amm but still ).. some have js bindings, some have stuff buried in the UI..
There is a token swap program in the Solana Program Library.
https://spl.solana.com/token-swap
Thanks
So jordan is the guy to ask about candy machine?
you're right, and does solana has something similar ? is it possible for example to do a token swap using Rust or Typescript ?
Yeah , though so. Please ask on Metaplex discord. Jordan is also doing office hourse in a hour or so I think.  Anyway, the first creator is the Candy Machine. I personally didn't work with it so ...
Basically, yeah.
Metaplex Candy Machine: https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/rust/nft-candy-machine
This still doesn't make sense to me. In both cases, the bridge will require a "bridged version" of the asset deployed as a smart contract on the target chain. An din both cases you still need to lock up the tokens on the parent chain and "mint" them on the other side. Seems like very much the same problem whether we're talking about fungible or non-fungible tokens...

So again - maybe it's just that we as an industry haven't done the same amount of effort at bridging NFTs as we have for fungible tokens. But is that all it is? Or is there some more fundamental difference I'm not seeing here?
All data on chain can be read.
Unsafe how?
?
Ughh. Generating stuff off chain doesn't make it unsafe
it is possible to generate it onchain but its computationaly expensive.
It comes to settling on a set of seeds that are you mapping or a index if your like. You generate the hash/address/pda offchain , give it to your contract which will create a account with that address and fill the accounts data.
I kinda understand that. But I can't find a good example to learn from
What contract did you deploy?
Im guessing you are doing a Metadata program ( creator signing). You are trying to mint. You put a creator public key in the data array of a createMetadataAccount instruction?
I guess no as there would be multiple security risk. Anyone can confirm ?
PDA are used as addresses of accounts that are tied to a particular program by their hash. they have no private key so programs can sign in their behalf. Metadata accounts are PDAs for example. They are used by Metadata program as a database of records.
What else I need t do!?!
I built and deployed the contract ok
Can someone tell what this guy meant by this? What do I need to do?
Can the signer in an `invoke` call be an account initially passed by the client ?
that is an uniswap function not eth
Hello, is there an equivalent on solana BC of the following eth function swapExactETHForTokens ?
somewhat like addresses with private key the program can use to call other things
easy explanation would be that PDAs are just addresses that the user (and program) can derive, but the user has no way of signing as a PDA
you read https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses right?
I'm trying to understand how PDAs work exactly but I don't have that much luck
so what am I missing
Is there any example for PDAs ?
I compiled and deployed the contract successfully with anchor.
<@!401880349166141441> can you point in the right direction on how to do that?
PDAs. they are hashes of your seeds like ( address, contract, somestring ) that dont have a private key.
you set verifed for a creator as true, but dont have its private key, or you didnt sign the transaction with creators key.
I have a program contract and deployed, but when minting a token through it it fails.
can someone for the love of god tell what this means `Program log: You cannot unilaterally verify another creator, they must sign` ?
What is the alternative for `mapping(address => uint256)` in Solana Rust ?
Can anyone help understand this?
Hi I have a quick question: The question is in regards to program: `4MNPdKu9wFMvEeZBMt3Eipfs5ovVWTJb31pEXDJAAxX5` on mainnet.. this program is some sort of validation program for SPL token transfers, but it is only deployed on mainnet and not on testnet or devnet. This is the reason, for example, that SPL transfers in Phantom Wallet don't work on devnet, because they're referencing this program_id which is only deployed on mainnet. I'm fairly new to Solana, so I'm wondering if anyone knows what this program is supposed to be doing exactly, and if it's possible to also deploy it onto devnet? <@!501570363566587905>
it goes private key then public key, it's an ed25519 keypair underneath, specifically this implementation: https://docs.rs/ed25519-dalek/1.0.1/ed25519_dalek/struct.Keypair.html
i was not going to be as helpful 😅
thanks for jumping in to help <@!137101040687382528> !
Hi. So when I try to create a keypair from mnemonics. It gives me a 64 length array. Does this contain both the private and the public key together? Each being 32  bytes? If so which order do they follow? Publickey first and then private key or vice versa?
if you build yourself, just make sure the final binary is x86_64, not arm 
```
❯ file bin/solana-test-validator
bin/solana-test-validator: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
```
ping me if it's not working. I went through all those issues already 😄
Thanks for the great help! you guys are awesome.  I'll do that.
if you don't want to cross-build yourself, what you can also try is updating your rust to the latest version, purging your solana installation (rm -rf ~/.local/share/solana, rm -rf ~/.cache/solana)
then re-installing the CLI tools with the latest v1.7.11

but I had issues with that installation for things like `solana-test-validator` not working, and building from source fixed all of that
ok trying that
ah wait, you might not need to cross-build actually if you just want to fix that bpf error
then after it built, manually copy the x86 binaries over the arm ones 
`cp target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/* bin/`
install the x86_64 toolchain: `rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-apple-darwin`
update your rust to latest stable 

update the install script with this patch

dvcrn where do you set that option?
well runnning test-bpf still had an error with cargo:warning=clang: error: the clang compiler does not support '-march=native'. on reed-solomon-erasure.
as in, clone the project and tell rust to compile for x86
I had some issues with m1 before but building the solana project with x86 target (from arm) fixed all of that
didn't know there was a rosetta terminal, I thought it it was a system wide effect. I'll try the terminal
And are you running `test-bpf` from within your rosetta terminal?
Yes build-bpf succeeds, test-bpf fails with clang error on..reed-solomon-erasure
It's complicated, but you can work through https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex as a fully-featured implementation
i think its not posible since its compiled as binary
How long does it take for a token name to appear on explorer after being merged into the token list on GitHub?
You got the error doing a `cargo test-bpf` on your program? Does `cargo build-bpf` succeed?
Is there an example of an NFT smart contract, create and deploy to solana? and then mint?
hey, is it possible to found a solana smart contract code by searching on the solana explorer?
this all worked, it was just the BPF test that threw the clang error
Is there any code that I can reference?
Hey, how would we deploy a token that redistributes/gives rewards on solana?
makes a lot of sense. you've been very helpful
okay, thanks a lot
On the other hand, if you decide to go this route, you can access the other instructions in a transaction using this sysvar: https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/sysvars#instructions
im just trying to ask if the state of the other instructions in a transaction is visible from a given instruction
Again, it's up to you, but I would do this through cross-program invocations, that way your program handles all of the movements of funds and you're sure that everyone gets what they should.
and if so , how?
I suppose the question is. can an on-chain program view the contents of the other instructions in the transaction it is being executed in
is this possible? or should I only use cross-program invocations to do something like this?
lets say that the transaction is being created on the client side of a website. how does my instruction (which disburses an NFT) verify that the other instructions that make up this  transaction are correct (such that the account the NFT is given to has paid a wallet some money)
Maybe you can start with the full example as is, get that working, and then add on whatever other features / changes you need?
All of these things are possible 🙂 in your instruction, you can do a cross-program invocation into another, and then in your program, double-check the results if you don't trust the program that you're calling into. you can also have a transaction with many different instructions in it, and check the other instructions to make sure that they conform to what you need
Thank you Jon, I'll try those and get back to you
Hm, I'm honestly not too familiar with rosetta, but if you can follow the instructions for setup at https://github.com/solana-labs/solana#1-install-rustc-cargo-and-rustfmt and then make sure you have the solana build tools in your rosetta environment https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools then you should be good to go
Wanted to go over liquidity mining rewards via options with someone
Kinda wish we had a channel specifically to discuss protocol design :(
like. lets say that this transaction mints an NFT in exchange for some sol. if the first instruction is from the system program and transfers the funds. and the second instruction is from my program and transfers the NFT... how do you verify that the funds were transferred in my program?
how does an instruction verify that the funds were moved in a previous instruction? can instructions verify the rest of the transaction?
Your best bet is to do transfer instructions within your program.  You can only operate in the same way as `move_funds.c` when both accounts are owned by your program
cargo test works.
Do I even need BPF?
Hello Jon, did a cargo clean and rebooted, but still getting: error: failed to run custom build command for `reed-solomon-erasure v4.0.2`, is there someplace to change the target? I installed rosetta.
Anyone who can help with paulx example. Insufficient funds error both accounts Alice and Bob are funded. It's driving me crazy because I've tried to fund every possible account and mint tokens to all auxiliary accounts. Still. getting the same error. I've copied hole code from paulx example as he suggested me that something is wrong with my code but still same error happens.
I got this "https://github.com/allartprotocol/unity-solana-wallet" 
but it can only use to connect to Phantom wallet and transfer Sol tokens to other user... but for NFTs mint or sell i didnt find anything...
I assume there is . but I don't know which of these three methods is correct
or do you invoke the system program from inside your contract to send money between wallets? i'm confused about how the user is supposed to trust a program that moves money if there doesn't seem to be a way to invoke it in a way that garuntees a limit on how much is moved that they can somehow confirm before making the transaction
closest thing is Solnet , but I think it doesnt work with Unity yet.
https://github.com/bmresearch/Solnet
i'm trying to write a contract that sends money between two addresses. is the standard way to do this something like this example?: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/22a18a68e3ee68ae013d647e62e12128433d7230/programs/bpf/c/src/move_funds/move_funds.c or is the standard way to invoke a transfer instruction on the system program? in which this transfer instruction would be one of several instructions in a transaction
any idea?
running into this:
```

Hello 👋 everyone  I'm new here and searching for way to link ntf with images using js any guide or help will be very nice
anylinks for proper solana unity sdk?
https://github.com/allartprotocol/unity-solana-wallet
Does anyone know how can i use Solana for NFTs?
Looks like we don't have it unfortunately, there's just the c headers at https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/sdk/bpf/c/inc which don't seem to include the system instructions
there's no way to generically send a transaction to a program through the CLI, so you'll need to write a simple CLI for yourself. feel free to use this template and add your instructions: https://github.com/mvines/solana-cli-template
ok jon
i believe you'll need to setup rosetta if you're working on m1 unfortunately
also. is the standard way to move funds something like this: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/22a18a68e3ee68ae013d647e62e12128433d7230/programs/bpf/c/src/move_funds/move_funds.c or using the "Transfer " feature of the system program?
where are the C bindings for this? https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/1.7.11/solana_sdk/system_instruction/enum.SystemInstruction.html
is it possible to send a transaction to a program via cli?
Hello! trying to setup https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold, after running  cargo test-bpf,  getting this error on mac m1.. clang: error: the clang compiler does not support '-march=native'. where to edit in the project to change march?
how do I send it directly  ?
I see..
ah i see, so that'll be different, doing a `pay` is sending a `transfer` transaction to the `system` program, telling it to move lamports from one account to another. you want to send a transaction to *your* program directly
right? but the intention was to send it a transaction no ?
firstattempt-keypair.json is a program / executable account, and your `instruction changed the balance of a executable account`

**dash-keypair** is the wallet address
**src/firstattempt** is the program address 

Thank you
Quite similar to the question above: Is there a implementation to do the minting with metadata through @solana/spl-token; @solana/web3.js?
Thx again!
You'd have to ask the phantom team about their specific implementation, I'm not too sure to be honest
I assume some standards have developed since wallets like Phantom are generally able to display NFT images; if every NFT token did this in a proprietary way in each program, the wallet would have a hard time showing those assets.
Thank you.
The error is telling everything here: ` instruction changed the balance of a executable account` -- so it seems like you're trying to move SOL from a program, which is not allowed.  You have to use another account, for example, your wallet
Finally, I found the reason is that I have an uninitialized account.
Hey there! You have to use a separate program to store metadata related to the NFT. for example, in metaplex, they use the `token-metadata` program to store that extra info: https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/rust/token-metadata
you have to pass the PDA from user side in with `writable` if I remember correct
I do send SOL to the program Id address correct?
what does this mean ?
Error: RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: instruction changed the balance of a executable account [3 log messages]
Nice
ty, I've fixed my problem by updating the web3 version.😆
Try to use localhost instead of 127.0.0.1
It could be that one of the accounts used to pay for the transaction is unfunded or that one small step was missed -- be sure to narrow down the exact transaction and instruction causing the issue
You can use `getProgramAccounts`, but it's not recommended because how much processing it takes from the node.  You're best off tracking things off-chain, as you mention later
Assuming I do have the token address.
Hey good morning all.  This seems like a sort of simple question but my Google-fu is honestly failing me (I may not know the right terms to search for).  For NFT tokens on the chain, how am I able to view the data (for example, JPEG data or external link to an image) via the JSON API?
Yep they should be the same -- rent and tx fees are the same. Definitely let us know if that' snot the case though
Does anybody encountered the insufficient  funds error while testing the pualx example. I've managed to add tokens to the escrow, but when I try to withdraw it to Bob's account I'am getting the Program log: Error: insufficient funds.  
I wasn't sure if's about my code, so I used the pualx code example. The same error happens. 
I've created the Alices account -> then two token mint accounts -> then Alices X and Y token accounts. I did the same for Bob but used the old token mint accounts as it's suggested in the example. Main accounts for Alice and Bob are both funded. I assume the error is for one of the auxiliary accounts but can't figure out which one and how to fund it. I've also tried to mint tokens to all auxiliary accounts before exchange, but the same error happens again.
let's hope this is it 😄 !
ah
I used the `-k` flag, check out `solana pay --help`
I think it's --keypair right/
https://discord.gg/xzuB9H2m
because right now i'm just specifying the program to receive SOL?
how do i specify the payer addres?

Okay sweet, so now this.. haha
let me try again
perfect
Yes, I just did it all to double check, it gave me the same issue, just tried another blockhash and it worked
how fast do i have to be to complete this step?
i literally did solana block right before doing so? shall i try again?
Get a more recent blockhash
Thanks! I don't use metadata. Is that provide a seeds can make PDA account writable, even it's not writable when passed in?
"recent blockhash"
the blockhash value
to obtain the blockhash I did **solana block** and copied
Error: RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found
v
<@456226577798135808> So this is my next response
Sure
Put the recipient address and amount first
wait doesn't the account that is sending the transaction need to have the sign?
if yours is not related to metadata it's probably a different reason. 
but basically double check that all accounts that have to be signers are signers, and all necessary accounts actually writable
I solved my issue, it was due to a bug in the metaplex rust package
<@!137101040687382528> Hi, bro, did you solve your CPI problem? I also ran into this `Cross-program invocation with unauthorized signer or writable account`.
Hi guys, I'm using the token lending program by solana...I have one question: how can I calculate the lend apy? and the borrow apy? is on chain or off chain?
or **solana pay** as described in the docs? but the error suggests using Transfer ?
do I have to use **solana transfer**
perhaps I have to specify the actual public address ?
"src/firstattempt-keypair..." and "1" after it ?
But I specified that ?
looks like you're missing recipient address and amount to send
why can't I push a transaction out? I've followed the docs step by step for offline signing ?
Hello, everyone. Can I convert the token address + contract address into the primary address?
I know that token address can be generated by using primary address + contract address~
I don't think. Is like decompiling raw EVM bytecode
Hey community, How are you doing? I have a quick question.  
- When you setup a backend environment that will interact with a Solana program, who is responsible for deploying that program? I worked with AWS, so If I say that the "program" is = to a "Database", the Database is setup by hand by me (developer) before I start the services(EC2..) for that environment. Is that the right approach(programs needs to be set by 'hand' before any services start)? Or do you treat the programs as another Service that is deployed once the backend also deploys? Or none of this?  Thank you.
Can you pull the program code and decompile it back to rust on SOL?
Is there any discord server for Anchor ?
thank you
yes
you need increase account size, memory
yup
But the problem is that with erc20 you bridge amounts with nfts you bridge smart contracts
You can lock it up inside the contract
well NFTs are non-fungible tokens. If you create a bridge you need some way to map them 1:1 on the other side and take the previous one out of circulation
Interesting. Is there some fundamental reason this differs with ERC20s, or is it just that more work has been done in the industry to actually produce ERC20 bridges vs NFT bridges?
Thank you
Yeah
Oh see, in order to apply that I need to create my own program/smart contract right?
This is the nice thing about Solana you can't fork stuff
Hi everyone. Just a question. I'm working on a real time trading charts app. I started with Ethereum and Smart Chain networks. In both cases, I'm maintaining my own node so I can get a stream with every block and then analyze the information looking for some dex smart contracts (route, add/remove liquidity). I want to start trying with Solana, but the requirementes for a validator node are too expensive for me at this moment. My question is, is there any service that provides an API to make queries and a real time stream of the blockchain?
Is there a ready programs or I need to create a program/smart contract for that? i'm referring like bscscan that can fork a reflect token.
Yeah go for it
Hi, Can I deploy reflect token smart contract on solana?

Hi, I'm run into the same problem. What do you mean by `the lib is not loaded`?
Deploy error from adding spl_token instruction
Hey all, hope this is the right place to ask... I'm considering launching an NFT set, and wondering about the tradeoffs of starting on Solana/Solanart. If I do this, will Wormhole (or something else) allow NFT holders to bridge them back to Ethereum?
looks like it's always using `~/.config/solana/id.json`
it doesn't change though and stays static, so it's gotta get it from somewhere
where does anchor on the clientside derive `provider.wallet` from? I thought it would use what's written in the toml, but it doesn't

  const program = new anchor.Program(idl, programId, provider);
```
thanks <@!137101040687382528> 🙂
Ah yeah true
you can also hold tokens in non-associated token accounts
yes correct, if the target account is the associated token account
as a follow up, im guessing i should fetch the associated token account in the client for the users accounts I'm sending between to find the source_pubkey and destination pubkey, and then pass those in the accounts to the program for the transfer?
https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/ts/classes/provider.html#send is where I found it
fair enough, i couldn't find where this was defined / specified tbh, did you find something for this?
sounds right
I see there is `program.provider` that can send transactions
Hey guys, I'm currently looking at the transfer instruction from the spl_token rust crate.

pub fn transfer(
    token_program_id: &Pubkey, 
    source_pubkey: &Pubkey, 
    destination_pubkey: &Pubkey, 
    authority_pubkey: &Pubkey, 
    signer_pubkeys: &[&Pubkey], 
    amount: u64
) -> Result<Instruction, ProgramError>

Have I got this right?
token_program_id: is just the spl_token::id()
source_pubkey: is the token account we want to transfer from
destination_pubkey: the token account we want to tranfer to
authority_pubkey: is the account that owns the source token account
signer_pubkeys: would just contain the authority pubkey
well i noticed here: https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/blob/c76db691cd1d639764ede457990612fac7ca7268/tests/escrow/tests/escrow.js#L92, that there's an instructions array prop for an rpc method defined in a program, not sure if this is related to what ur asking but it might be 🤷‍♀️
oh, cool
prob not atm (tho maybe, might be worth checking args for this), but is prob doable in the future i'd imagine
it generates the instruction.* and rpc.* methods just fine and I can use them, but what if I want to batch multiple instructions in the same tx
yeah I'm doing that already 🙂
for e.g. `anchor build` is just

```
cargo build-bpf
anchor idl parse -f program/src/lib.rs -o target/idl/basic_0.json
```
according to their docs
i wonder if u can use `anchor idl parse`  with already deployed programs (or specs for them) to generate the json idl for external code in some capacity 🤔, i have nfi tho tbh
found https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/issues/59
try updating your rust toolchain and rust
realistically, someone coming from a higher level interpreting language like python/js.. just how big is the rust/sol ecosystem learning curve? Have done plenty of research but would like to hear from those who have done it first hand.
just browsing through past messages. It seems like if I want to keep a record of all the accounts, I would have to store it off-chain
another question one - is there an anchor-ey way to chain instructions from non-anchor programs? 
For example if I do 
```
await program.instruction.foo()
```

and I want to add a few other instructions to batch in the same tx, would I submit those instructions like usual through `web3.sendAndConfirm`? 
Because `program` is already setup with connection and what not, so creating another connection seperate for this feels weird
To have each user own his address to make transactions by programmatically controlled by my api, but by not his own
is missing some stuff like "address = <pubkey>" or w.e. but is the best i've found
How to solve this dependency error?
thanks
oh perfect
https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/0.14.0/anchor_lang/derive.Accounts.html
it's written in the docs too but think of accounts as files in a file system
what specifically do you want to achieve
Hello, I am making web app integrated with solana blockchain with my own token. Is it possible to create account ("sub-address")  for each registered user ?
and is there a way for me to track all the accounts?
ahh okay
so he can't sign anything
the user doesn't hold the private key to mess with accounts the program created (unless specified)
I still can't wrap my head around this. I must be missing something. If we don't have global state for a program, doesn't that mean any user can just deploy their own program and modify their account data? How can we ensure the integrity of their account data?
you can create all the instructions and batch them in the same transaction
is there proper documentation somewhere for all the different anchor attributes like 
```
    #[account(signer)]
```

can't manage to find it
if I've created a new spl-token and want to deliver it to 1000 people (e.g. like via an airdrop), is there a simple way to do this?, instead of having to do each individual transfer transaction via the CLI
thanks for the resources! let me check that
i am struggling through new stuff too and am deffo not super experienced or able to help you a ton beyond this though 😂
not sure, deffo worth checking out some of the examples in anchor/tests though fwiw, iirc they do signed cross program invocation in here using the token program id https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/blob/master/tests/escrow/programs/escrow/src/lib.rs
better than this snippet
```
        let (payer_address, payer_bumpseed) =
            Pubkey::find_program_address(&[&derivation_seed.key.to_bytes(), br"payer"], &id());
        let payer_signer_seeds: &[&[_]] = &[
            &derivation_seed.key.to_bytes(),
            br"payer",
            &[payer_bumpseed],
        ];

        if payer.key != &payer_address {
            msg!("Err: payer derivation mismatch");
            return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
        }
```
does anchor have some better way of doing PDAs by chance?
let me try that
i think u can initialize CpiContext with any program_id iirc fwiw. u deffo can invoke_signed a non-anchor program from an anchor program for sure tho
are the prices of deploying programs on the devnet roughly equivalent to the price for deploying the same program on live?
Still wondering about this. <@!585868308419444749> perhaps you know the answer to this question? It's very much related to the advice you've just given. (I'm *not* planning to have a global account that's always being written to in my design, but *some* actions will have write conflicts, so I'm wondering what kind of throughput to expect.)
or is this only working when target and caller are anchor programs
https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/tutorials/tutorial-3.html#defining-a-puppet-master-program
there's some CpiContext stuff -
in anchor, is there a different / better way to call between programs than `invoke_signed` with PDA derived seeds?
There's some stuff in the programing model docs, IIRC. https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts
I see. Let me explore a bit more on this topic. thanks
No I'm saying you should rethink your design because it will perform poorly
and just to confirm my understanding. You are saying that I should hardcode an account inside the program to use as global state
thank you for answering! Are there any examples/documentations related to this concept?
<@!73659979663413248> ☝️
If you need global state, just use another account that's shared.  Be aware that this is an anti-pattern in Solana as you contract write locking the same account for all transactions will force them to be executed serially
it seems that data is stored per account? is there a way to store global states?
I think this is what I was looking for: https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/rust/token-metadata/program
hi all, quick question regarding the hello-world example. if I remove the account.owner != program_id check, is every account going to have their own counter variable?
`system_program_info` should be present
no, I think that code just doesn't work
Is there some implicit passing going on?
It should
That actually looks like a bug to me!
or really any metadata that might associate with each nft to make it unique
It's calling the system program to create an account, but doesn't include `system_program_info` in the `account_infos` parameter passed to `invoke`.
let's take the nft example: where would the image URL be stored if not on the solana blockchain?
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/stake-pool/program/src/processor.rs#L757
where?
Can you elaborate? The `stake-pool` example doesn't seem to do that.
that doc is correct
🙏  thanks so much for all this info!
The doc for `invoke` says:
> Note that the program id of the instruction being issued must also be included in `account_infos`.
So is that incorrect?
you pass into invoke what the target program expects
So do we have to pass the callee account info in the last parameter to `invoke`? For example I don't see `system_program_info` being passed here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/stake-pool/program/src/processor.rs#L757. However the doc for `invoke` says that's required https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/1.6.22/solana_sdk/program/fn.invoke.html.
There's not. no
not sure where to find docs on this i am new to this
for example i am going to pull request to add a token name/image, can it be an imgur link?
hi sorry can i upload any link for an image for creating a new token?
Also, there's no method to get a signature count for a specific account is there?
Yeah, I didn't see a filter or the likes mentioned for said method. Cheers.
You're referring to calls to `getSignaturesForAddress2` et. al?  These don't support server-side filtering, so you'd need to do it client side
Makes absolute sense, no worries. Was wondering what routes could be taken to filter-out an account addresses signatures by a specific instruction? Or a way to filter an address's signatures by an input account attribute?
The team prefers to keep all conversation in public if possible.  It's better for the community to be self-sufficient and maximally disseminate info
Hey <@!539801435571748868> I sent you a friend request. Would like to chat about something Solana related, cheers 🙂
there is an experimental setting in the jetbrains rust plugin to enable experimental macro expansion. Enabled that and now it works
oh I guess it does resolve it and compiles fine, just my IDE (CLion) can't deal with the macro
spl_token_program does this
```
solana_program::declare_id!("TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA");

/// Checks that the supplied program ID is the correct one for SPL-token
pub fn check_program_account(spl_token_program_id: &Pubkey) -> ProgramResult {
    if spl_token_program_id != &id() {
        return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

so it's just doing `&id()` but in my own program it can't resolve it
how exactly does `declare_id!` work? How does the program know ahead of time what ID it's going to have
Also how do I access it's own ID within the program?
thanks
It’ll work, yes.
does anyone know the answer to this?
<@!594730464401555470> <@!828703734267641887> <@!706873452576899182> here is a nice gist written in Typescript by dvcrn for getting the token URI from said address. There's also an implementation and guide, can search through my sent messages, there's github links to a guide and Kotlin implementation as well.
hmm maybe ill do that lol
something like this but more general in the kind of data fetched
Someone should keep a repository of useful data collecting programs for ease of use.
Here's the full cargo, that's the full error, the `...` is just the path to the program directory.

```
[package]
name = "my-program"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2018"

[features]
no-entrypoint = []

[dependencies]
account-decoder = { path = "../account-decoder" }
instruction-creator = { path = "../instruction-creator" }
solana-program = "1.7.10"
spl-token = { version = "3.2.0", features = ["no-entrypoint"] }
spl-token-swap = { version = "2.1.0", features = ["no-entrypoint"] }
thiserror = "1.0.26"
arrayref = "0.3.6"

[dev-dependencies]
solana-program-test = "1.7.10"
solana-sdk = "1.7.10"
spl-associated-token-account = "1.0.3"
spl-token-test = { package = "spl-token", version = "3.2.0" }
spl-token-swap-test = { package = "spl-token-swap", version = "2.1.0" }

[lib]
name = "my_program"
crate-type = ["cdylib", "lib"]
```

I was trying to do something like this

```
let program_id = Pubkey::new_unique();

    let mut program_test = ProgramTest::new(
        "my_program", // Run the BPF version with `cargo test-bpf`
        program_id,
        processor!(my_program::entrypoint::process_instruction), // Run the native version with `cargo test`
    );

    let spl_token_program_id = Pubkey::new_unique();
    let spl_token = program_test.add_program(
        "spl_token",
        spl_token_program_id,
        processor!(spl_token_test::entrypoint::process_instruction)
    );

    let spl_token_swap_program_id = Pubkey::new_unique();
    let spl_token_swap = program_test.add_program(
        "spl_token_swap",
        spl_token_swap_program_id,
        processor!(spl_token_swap_test::entrypoint::process_instruction)
    );
```
it would appear your result is too large to get processed.   getProgramAccounts takes some parameters right?
How can I used my phantom wallet from the cmd?
what is the full cargo? and full error?
All goods, so now there's two gists available when someone asks how to get the token URI from said address. Kotlin and Javascript/Typescript 😛
ah whoops I didn't even notice
Nice, maybe just bring your function decodeMetadata into the gist itself as well so the gist is more complete.
thats awesome <@!137101040687382528>  thanks!
in case it's helpful
I stripped out the metadata fetch code from my app and put it into a gist 🙂 https://gist.github.com/dvcrn/c099c9b5a095ffe4ddb6481c22cde5f4
Is there any function at web3js that I can detect a 429 and slow down?
Started getting this error today ```Cannot create a string longer than 0x1fffffe8 characters
        at Buffer.utf8Slice (<anonymous>)
``` after calling ```await connection.getProgramAccounts()```. Does anybody know what's wrong?
Sure! I really like the idea and technology behind it. You guys are familiar to basic terms i.e. what is minting etc. There are many talented developers out of your community and can contribute to the ecosystem but cannot due to having a initial learning barrier
It is a rapidly growing eco system and the technology is getting released before all the guides, learning materials, documentations, and updates have had a chance to catch up fully. Please continue the feedback, and even better where you can, please contribute! and thank you for your help.
an even bigger thanks due for creativedrewy and his guide & implementation 😄
I'm using solana-program-test, but I need some packages such as spl-token. But when I import them in my Cargo.toml like this:

```
spl-token = { version = "3.2.0", features = ["no-entrypoint"] }
spl-token-swap = { version = "2.1.0", features = ["no-entrypoint"] }
thiserror = "1.0.26"
arrayref = "0.3.6"

[dev-dependencies]
solana-program-test = "1.7.10"
solana-sdk = "1.7.10"
spl-associated-token-account = "1.0.3"
spl-token-test = { package = "spl-token", version = "3.2.0" }
spl-token-swap-test = { package = "spl-token-swap", version = "2.1.0" }
```

I have this error, `the crate ... depends on crate 'spl-token v3.2.0' multiple times with different names`

Anyway to resolve this?
this is great <@!201528134682673152> ! thanks
I will try making a gist of the Typescript implementation I have, if you have powers to pin, this question of getting the token URI do be coming up a lot
kotlin implementation for getting token URI of tokens owned by an address: https://github.com/creativedrewy/NATIV/blob/main/SolanaNFT/src/main/java/com/creativedrewy/solananft/metaplex/MetaplexNftUseCase.kt
generic guide:
https://gist.github.com/creativedrewy/9bce794ff278aae23b64e6dc8f10e906
I'm gonna give it a go 🙂
Such documents are really important to improve the ecosystem but they really lacks to teach anything. This webpage: https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard#token-metadata-program or just a small piece of rust codes at here: https://github.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp/tree/main/contracts/solana/program doesn't mean much thing.

I don't know how you guys learn all the concepts and develop something on Solana 🙂
Thanks man!
https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard#token-metadata-program  you need to get the metadata struct and parse the info. not aware of any code snippets, but some may be out there.
start with it
https://github.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp.git
Is there an open-source or docs that I can study to dev/create (for practice as of now) for Minting Website, Contract Development, and deployment?
how to solve it
Is there any web3js example for websockets https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#subscription-websocket

Documentation lacks because it doesn't mention even what is development ws address for Solana
hello everyone,I build a program use anchor,deploy is finsh but no file no target/idl dir
and that the structures and enums described in the token.h header would be passed in as data
do you know how the token program is meant to be used by an on-chain C program? My best guess is that you can use `sol_invoke` with a `SolInstruction` that will access the functionality of the SPL token program
I understand. but i'm not interested in learning a new language right now.
I'd recommend using Rust. Your life will be a lot easier, since most examples and learning resources are using it.
the one described in the documentation here: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/inc/token.h
is that C API is intended for on-chain programs to invoke the token program as a standardized way to implement its functionality? or is it for off-chain usage
it's describing enums and structs that map to its functionality. but I don't really know how to call anything
also, the C API for the SPL token program that confuses me. It just points to a header and doesn't really explain itself, describes no functions. etc. how do I invoke it?
thanks a lot
You can see the `program-id` file https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/program-id.md
where can I find the standardized address for the SPL token program then?
Most programs on solana work this way.
Standardized addresses.
it says in the docs that the SPL is a collection of on-chain programs. does that mean that SPL programs are similar to the native programs in that they have a standardized address? or are we to launch instances of SPL programs ourselves to then invoke
anyone know?
how the hell do I get metadata or uri from that!
so I managed to get the NFT account
ok ok
When an instruction needs a `payer`, is it possible to pass the users wallet as signer when calling between programs? (When the users wallet is already a signer)

Currently I’m creating a temporary PDA account, move lamports into that and use it as payer, but just using the users wallet would be much nicer
NFT standard: https://www.metaplex.com/, and storefront.   Node code marketplace: https://www.holaplex.com/
thanks!
from phantom website: https://discord.gg/D2XwQGgJV8
Anyone have a working example of implemented merkle trees for whitelisted addresses?
I don't think Phantom has a discord?
is there any thing out there which will allow me to let users mint a certain amount of NFTs directly of my site and it'll auto send them the art
at the moment, yes. some apps have posted their programs
ok thanks - so its very hard to read transactions and determine exactly what they are doing?
its great. def give it a spin.
any process for sending from eth to solana chains may take a good amount of time, I would try the phantom discord.
no there is not currently a similar solution for native solana programs. there are initiatives to have some similar tools available.
generic question - is there a way to validate the code of deployed contracts ala Etherscan verification?
ie. what is the process for finding all contract methods & their logic?
hi - I sent wBTC from Ethereum to my Phantom wallet.  The transaction was successful on ethereum but the wBTC is not in my Phantom wallet.  Is there anyone that can please assist?
The baked-in validation stuff looks nice
What’s the general opinion on anchor here?
just need wallet and amount to send
I can really set it up anyway that works
its maybe 500 accounts
Just web3.js, I copied the metadata code from the metaplex javascript code
I don't know whether developers answers questions at Discord bu here is my question:

When `429` error occurs this error is thrown:

`429 Too Many Requests:  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code": 429, "message":"Too requests for a specific RPC call, contact your app developer or support@rpcpool.com."}, "id": "ae352600-4567-4839-a787-39b3d09e95c5" }`

How can such a string parsed? Why not returning a json?
how would I seprate the wallet and amount from text
im kinda a bash noob
Sure 👍
<@!201528134682673152> | I shot you a friend request - let's sync up!
H/T to all you as your resources, links, etc. are immensely valuable. The community within Solana is like no other. 🚀
What language are you using?
Sweet thanks. Do you have a specific method to point me to perhaps?
Along with a reference implementation in Kotlin: https://github.com/creativedrewy/NATIV/blob/main/SolanaNFT/src/main/java/com/creativedrewy/solananft/metaplex/MetaplexNftUseCase.kt I was able to replicate this in Typescript —> In step 5 of the guide you’ll need to borsh deserialise data. This should be available in the npm package metaplex/js at a later stage. Still doable I just downloaded the source code and copied the file containing the metadata class and worked backwards porting over folders like utils.ts which’ve been imported. If you’re using the web3 solana package in JS, the guide references using parsed at a few points, in the guide he was maybe able to pass it as an argument but the web3 package provides them as named functions.
Could you guide me how to do this?

Hello Solana team.
Fixed by updating anchor

and then i 64decoded it into '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'.

How users trust to dapp without reading sorce code ?
is there "verify contract" in solana like ethereum ?
Hi, I'd like to reach out to someone from your team regarding launching my new project on Solana. Please would you guys (<@&439193644826755093>?)  be able to assist here? Thank you 🙂
https://docs.solana.com/offline-signing#example-offline-signing-a-payment
i mean keypair
how to generate a base58 address instead of base64 ?
so I'm going off the doc, but it seems to be giving me errors
Yeah, if it can't parse it it'll return a base64 encoded string
i tried using the jsonParsed, but it still returns the base64 data
Use jsonParsed as a parameter when you subscribe, otherwise decode the base64 string yourself
i'll test the solana block now
solana block and the RPC HTTP provides two different values
getting those errores. Any idea why? I gave up on windows and switched to wsl
<@456226577798135808>
Should still work if your test validator is running. You could also try `solana block` on the cli
Where do I  get the url to get the info for each token so I can show an NFT png / image?
sorry I am on Localhost
Thanks <@456226577798135808> - however Error: RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found. 
i used the getRecentBlockhash method ( i am on devnet )
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getrecentblockhash
hello guys, in the websocket programSubscribe, maybe i ask how could i decode the data in the result into more human-readable form?😫
my keypair is generated fine afaik
to perform signing a transaction?
Can someone tell me how to obtain the latest block hash via cli ?
So you can call TokenProgram.Transfer and not SystemProgram.Transfer. Make any program usable with tokens usable with sol.
So is it a reasonable approach to create a TokenAccount for a WrappedSol if the goal is to create a temporary account that someone would send SOL to?
for offline signing ?
Hello how do i obtain the --blockhash ?
https://spl.solana.com/token wrapped sol mint to use the functions of the spl-token program, otherwise you would use system functions to transfer/credit/debit lamports.  wrap SOL address: So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112 the same way you create a token account for any other type of token, with the token mint address, for that token mint.
In the web3 package, this function `async getAccountInfo(publicKey, commitment)` doesn't seem to comply with the JSON api. Is there a reason for that? I'd like to set the encoding to jsonParsed.
Also, what would be the use case for a WrappedSol's Token account?
you might be referring to 'instructions',  in which case you can add multiple instructions to a single transaction, as needed: for example: 
psuedo:

`const tx = new Transaction();
tx.add(...txInstructions);
sendTransaction(tx, signers);`
How do I create a token account for a wrapped sol?
i'm using java so there is no library like this
For Sol simple SystemProgram.CreateAccount. It is not a token account.
hello guys, may i ask that if the "jsonParsed" encoding not working on websocket programSubscribe ?
Sol -- the goal is to use this Token Account as a recipient inside of an Escrow
Sol or wraped Sol?
How do I create a token account for the token SOL?

```
const newTokenAccountForSolIx = Token.createInitAccountInstruction(
  TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  "SOL1...", // mint (what should I use as "mint" if the token I want to create an account for is SOL?)
  publicKeyForNewTokenAccountForSol,
  ownerPublicKey
);
```
is there "verify contract" in solana like ethereum ?
token has methods like createInitMintInstruction , createInitAccountInstruction .. that you can simply add to the transaction.
message: invalid controller

using windows
yes ive tried a couple of times
an issue generating your passphrase, can you try again?
thanks! this is helpful, they do use multiple transactions here in this example though
But this seems to be for a Solana smart contract with one function. What if it has multiple?
How do you call a function on a Solana smart contract. i've seen it done like this: ```const buffer = Buffer.from("hello");
  const instruction = new web3.TransactionInstruction({
    keys: [{ pubkey: fromWallet.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true }],
    programId: new web3.PublicKey(metaDataProgramID),
    data: buffer,
  });
  const confirmation = await web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction(
    connection,
    new web3.Transaction().add(instruction),
    [fromWallet],
    {
      commitment: "singleGossip",
      preflightCommitment: "singleGossip",
    }
  );```
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/examples/create_mint_and_transfer_tokens.js
what means

it's possible to intialize mint, initialize token account, and mint to token account in the same transaction?
if they are not in the same transaction then yes.
apparently you do
The command is now  `solana program dump <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> dump.so` fyi
I guess so. The docs also mentions `solana dump <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> dump.so` but there is no dump in solana-cli 1.7.11
do i need to wait for the intiialize mint instruction to confirm before intializing token accounts?
Or should I deploy my own?
Is there a DAO program on chain already?
I'm trying to create an account then initialize a token account, getting the following error:
```Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x2
```
Hlelo could someone tell me how i could obtain the blockhash? I am trying to sign offline via rust
is the documentation for this outdated? https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/deploying

Upon a successful deployment the account that holds the program is marked executable and its account data become permanently immutable. If any changes are required to the program (features, patches, etc...) the new program must be deployed to a new program ID.

but on https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program#redeploy-a-program it states that a program can be redeployed assuming there's enough space and the program wasn't marked `--final` and it was initially deployed using `solana program deploy ...` instead of `solana deploy...`
a mint account is essentially an account that was created using the spl-token program id. referred to as a mint account, or token minting account.  this account is used to 'mint' tokens and has an owner and authority.  when you call `spl-token create-token` you are creating an account and 'initializing a mint' with the spl-token program id, and setting the authority of the 'mint'. the mint account is essentially the primary token authority account, and you use this account (mint account) to create accounts for other addresses/or users, so they can have a token account for this particular mint.  You create a token (a mint), and create a token account to hold the tokens for that mint (type of token).
I didn't know that we have to pay for RPC calls to Solana if we exceed number of 10 requests per second. Why there is a low limit for development purposes. Check infura https://infura.io/pricing It is free for 100,000 Requests/Day
is that right?
got it ok, so the mint authority can be the same as the mint account
Thats a mint account. your token account is 8L5VuoRQnwYrL8VMyfKTf7LkssmTND3VxAANswzufokt
is that a valid token?
i minted this token, and it has same account for mint authority
https://explorer.solana.com/address/2CF5zEHFSZeUW873oTBuxeLBrdAKiBV5iyc7cPx61KKG?cluster=devnet
No. They are not same, as information is not organized in a same layout.
sorry, the mint authority
whats a mint account?
Hi, I can create a token where the mint account is the token account?
wow, this is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!
hey guys, anyone know what method I can use to pull tokens from blockchain with wallet like phantom?

you just 'invoke' / call the program, essentially sending a transaction, from within your program, using the programs address, and sending the data/instructions, you want to pass to the program.
Anchor serves as a great framework for Solana, can make things faster and simpler, and provides solutions a lot of utilities akin to what a framework provides underlying technology.
https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html

In ethereum you have concepts like 'owner', in Solana accounts have an owner, and authority that can be checked. Accounts are owned by programs, and authority can permit authorization for operations. You can define your own constraints, or use Anchors macros and helpers to make this even easier.

Thats a quick dive..
You use the terminal/CLI to build with cargo, and deploy your programs to a cluster/network (local, dev, test, main)

You can run a local network in 1 cli command (solana-test-validator), and deploy to it, using it for dev until your ready to test furhter on the other networks.
But basically, you create instructions that you send in transactions (specifying the program with its address/ program id) and you use the processor to receive transaction calls for your program and process the instructions and data.
You pass in all accounts you will interact with, the program id (smart contract address/key)
There are native programs in Solana you can interact with that have known addresses
Most front ends use an interface, sdk, or some other means to setup web3/RPC calls to the programs. Javascript web3 is popular and there are many other methods and means to communicate with programs in general like CLI

Fullstack: simple dapp scaffold /w wallet integration here: https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold

A typical program setup consists of:
Processor.rs: entry point, handler, receives the calls, routes/attends transactions for processing
State.rs: (where you can further define your data models,
Instructions.rs: defines instructions sets that will be built and passed into transactions, and processed when received by the processor
Lib.rs may store supporting functions and functionality
entrypoint.rs: may be used to simply define the program entry point
You may see others or a combination of these, or just all of it in one file
Quick run down:
one of the bigger difference from ethereum and other blockchains, is that Solana programs are stateless, and dynamic data is not stored inside the program itself. The way you want to design programs and applications is utilizing a stateless design approach. In general, everything you need to the program to act on, should be passed into the program.  Everything stems from accounts, and keys, which are associated with accounts, which is just a block of data sitting on chain. The solana docs are worth reading, and do not take too long. https://docs.solana.com/  , https://spl.solana.com/token 
Solana programs are Rust or C/C++ based, using cargo for packages
SDKs are being created in many languages, including .Net, python, Go, and more

Solana 'Programs' are your 'Ethereum Smart Contracts

In Solana Programs: 
Programs do not store state, Ethereum contracts do
You need to pass in all actionable data to the program
You generally communicate with programs through 'transactions'

Tokens & Programs:
Sol native currency in Solana is referred to as lamports (like Eth wei), and SOL as token is wrapped SOL acted on with SPL-Token
Solana SPL-Token is the token program standard used to create, transfer, mint, and act on tokens, likened to Eth ERC20
Metaplex NFT standard is likened Eth ERC721 NFT, https://www.metaplex.com/
Wallets use keypairs, private+public key : sample wallet integration: https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter
Program ID is the public Key/Address, Same as what the smart contract adddress/public key is for Ethereum
Transactions take in accounts (keys), program id, signers, Instructions, and data (in general)
A good tutorial on this is here: https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/#q-a
So just a PR pull request is required?
Solana to Ethereum Cookbook
Any ideas?
I test my application on devnet. Everything was OK but I started to get error today:

`Error: 429 Too Many Requests:  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code": 429, "message":"Too requests for a specific RPC call, contact your app developer or support@rpcpool.com."}, "id": "r7576a41-2769-42f5-a185-325334eef194" }
`
In fact, I don't make too many calls
Yeah but it works with just writing  some function signatures instead of copying the whole program?
I think this message is relevant to my question. My question is specifically what I can use for the `mint` field when I want to create a Token Account for `SOL`
is it possible to transfer tokens without passing the accounts to the program?
Let's say the token account is owned by the program and I know the address of the token account beforehand.
Im trying to make a Solana smart contract that stores metadata for an NFT like: https://github.com/roederw/create-solana-nft-example. But when i try to it throws off all of these unrelated errors: https://pastebin.com/Yy775Erj in the library's this code is using I'm not sure if it is related to me using an M1 mac
Should I make an instruction that looks like this?

```
const newTokenAccountForSolIx = Token.createInitAccountInstruction(
  TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  "SOL1...", // mint (I'm not sure if I can use `SOL1...` as the mint key
  publicKeyForNewTokenAccountForSol,
  ownerPublicKey
);
```
How do I make a Token Account that can receive SOL?
i believe some are working on 'Eth to Solana cookbooks', correlation, howtos, and even actual contract translation.  In the mean time, most of the the best resources are now linked from the Solana Developer page (https://solana.com/developers).
this is where you submit for token info currently.  https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list  it is a respected list to use to map token information.
you can pass almost anything you want within the size constraints
Anyone else having trouble airdropping sol on devnet and testnet? CLI, web UIs, scripts all failing…
ok. an actual 'interface' in Solidity, like in other languages, is where you define a set of function definitions under an interface keyword, that can be used as a type of blueprint or layout that a contract or something using the interface has the ability to define and fill in the logic.  it sounds like your talking about an interface between programs, calling 1 program from another program, and program to program interaction:  enter CPI: https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#cross-program-invocations
hey all. getting :insufficient lamports when trying to run candy_machine Upload cna anyone help please
can I pass a random number to the program till there isn't an oracle?
Hello,
How can we submit token data like Name Symbol & Decimal on DevNet?
are there any articles/tutorials that draw correlations between solana program development and e.g. eth smart contract development?

NFT and Metadata references
NFTs use the concept of meta data. The owning authority can change the meta data.
I assume that's how Aavegotchi does it with wearables. Could be wrong tho
For example, to keep a record on the starships "maintenance state"
Yeah for sure
It does, doesn't it.
Sounds interesting
Thanks it work

Yes indeed
??
so kind of dynamic NFT
Hi guys, quick question on game dev and NFT. 1. Can a NFT hold data -- like the NFT being a starship WITH a gun X? 2. And can that starship NFT be updated to not have the gun anymore?
aah ok, let me try
Update your rust version to the lastest rust stable. `rustup update stable`
```cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.15.0 anchor-cli --locked``` this is I used inorder to install

any help
I tried to install latest version of anchor, but it failed to build
Could someone point me to some documentation/repo that would help me understand how to make a trading bot on Solana ? That'd be awesome. Thank you
If I generate a keypair on the client side (I throwaway the private key, but we can always assume that a savvy user can remember the private key).

And let's say I transfer the authority of the private key to a PDA. 

Can the holder of the private key still have access to the account? Or, because the PDA now owns the account, only the PDA can modify the account?
actually, less than 2 TPS. I haven't figured out the right sustainable TPS for connection.onAccountChange yet
Nope, Not a txn, just a way to validate if the user owns the account off-chain.
but for `connection.onAccountChange` it's more like 2 tps...
for `connection.getAccountInfo`, I seem able to sustain it at 4TPS
Is the TPS limit for `connection.onAccountChange` different from that for `connection.getAccountInfo`?

Thank you Sir ❤️
you can use the web 3 library.  https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/  the figment tutorial gives some example usage among others: https://learn.figment.io/pathways/solana-pathway
I see, personal sign is verified on chain. It sounds like your talking about verifying on a server before its submitted? or your own verification of some kind.
I see, these still create on-chain txns. What I am looking for is a way of signing a message like `hello world` using the private key and then then recover the public key on the server side to validate if the message signer is indeed who they claim to be.
Hello everyone ! 
I'm building a little Dapp and I would just like to be able to make solana transactions in Vanilla Javascript

I have already managed to connect to my phantom wallet and sign a message! PLEASE It's been 2 Night of researches
if your referring to offline signing, I am not certain on an exact strong equivalent of this, though verification would be done when processing the transactions.  what I have available on hand is some current documentation in regards to offline signing:
https://spl.solana.com/token#example-offline-signing-with-multisig
https://docs.solana.com/offline-signing
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/docs/src/offline-signing.md

for just verifying who signed a transaction after it was sign the relevant transaction data has the signature who signed and other info. the above feature you mentioned `personal_sign` usually refers to offline, which there are the above facilities, but I am uncertain how general use or flexible its current state is. Another may have more information in this regard.

In general this is usually done referencing special keys a block instance nonce and or hash of values, then verified through a similar manner inside the program. I would imagine something similar could be accomplished and some of the above references may handle this automatically.
Hey, Is there a Solana alternative for `personal_sign` in Ethereum. Need a way to recover and validate if a message was indeed signed by a user.
also since I'm using VSCode from Windows, I had an ambiguous "Permission denied" error running `cargo build-bpf`, so i managed to fix it with a few more library installations on the Linux side:

```
sudo apt install build-essential clang cmake
```
it worked now, thanks! I ran npm install before already, but apparently i had to run inside the src folder for whatever reason
i'm new to Solana but figured this out last night: I installed Ubuntu on Windows with WSL, then installed rust/solana in my Ubuntu terminal and ran it from there
found an easier solution - simply pass `feeDiscountPubkey: null` into `placeOrder`.  I completely missed it originally - I thought it checks for null but it actually checks for undefined, hence null is a valiad param.

Hey everyone. I suppose this is a noob question: I am currently trying my hands on the example-helloworld project and I am encountering some dependency issues. In particular, my ts program cannot find modules "mz/fs" and "borsh". Does somebody know where I can get those? I followed the instructions in the README.

Hey guys any1 gettin
How can one use token to gain profit ?
Hi guys. I'm confused
hey devs just a quick question - when minting / creating spl tokens - whats the best way to decorate the spl token with metadata - esp if its an NFT?
you can still use https://api.devnet.solana.com to develop your dapp.
already got it. Thank you !
Thank you. Do you know how to use solana api to get the token address. I tried to use getTransaction. But the result does not include token address
thanks for the idea
smart
ha that might actually be easier than changing the sdk
yeah
oh sorry you mean change the actual program code
then deploy a serum locally
you can just change the bsae fee to be w/e and even add a rebate for base fees
its in the fees.rs file
when you say change manually - where would you change that? isn't fee calculatino baked into the sdk?
and never ran into this issue so I cant help there. The only thing I can think of being an issue is calculating fees which you can just change manually while you build and trust that serum works in prod when you deploy it
you can ask in dev support in serum. I am using a fork of it on localnet and using placeOrder
which means the SDK fails every time I hit the `placeOrder` function
basically serum's SDK expects a Mint account with their `SRMxxx` publickey to exist - but to create it I need the keypair for it and I don't have it
that's the problem:(
Maybe there is a way to create an spl bpf program for a token i have never done it or looked into it
i dont think so because you would need the signer to do it
interesting - can I also create a token Mint with any address on localnet? I obv don't have the keypair for Serum
you can run deploy any program with any viable public address using --bpf-loader when you run solana-test-validator

https://explorer.solana.com/tx/5978BY6Wxy33HiwhMx2r7CVQ7M1pryAiXZ9B1GPJaHxCTsPJn3P6x3MWmahPJrLJRnvgyfHieSdFB3A5rK8K4chF

Hello, is it possible to get token address from this transaction: 
5978BY6Wxy33HiwhMx2r7CVQ7M1pryAiXZ9B1GPJaHxCTsPJn3P6x3MWmahPJrLJRnvgyfHieSdFB3A5rK8K4chF
thanks a lot ❤️
Hm was aware of that, but here's the problem I'm facing:
- I'm trying to run Serum on localnet
- Serum's ts SDK expects a Mint account with address `SRMuApVNdxXokk5GT7XD5cUUgXMBCoAz2LHeuAoKWRt`
- Obviously there is no such Mint account on localnet, since it's a fresh network
- This results in SDK throwing an error along the lines of "Mint account wrong"

The only way so far I've found around this is to copy paste the sdk locally, change the address to some Mint account I created through https://www.spl-token-ui.com/#/ and then re-run

But this obviously sucks. Is there a way to solve this without having to manually modify the SDK?
You can wrap some sol into token

Hello everyone ! I'm building a little Dapp and I would just like to be able to send solana from one account to another (Transaction) in javascript some ideas? I have already managed to connect to my phantom wallet and sign a message!
Sorry I just got in to this whole thing after 20 years of not using cpp or any of the programming i learned in CC.
or would I need a separate contract to interact with the wallet and the nft?
Wanted to know if an NFT would be able to own its own wallet and hold funds? Is that a feature that could be implemented in solana?
I often see some program id has interesting name like the token program has this name address `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`. Do you guys know how they make it?
I just explored have started exploring solana. so I found that we can mint new nft with cli I just wanted to know that can we use rust(or other language)  to develop a smart contract to mint a nft?
Please share If any resources are available.
Is there a way to airdrop test SOL tokens to my Phantom wallet and be able to use it across our web apps?
Can CPIs use accounts or PDAs not specified in the top level instruction? Ie is there any way to get an accountInfo that is not explicitly referred to from the initial transaction RPC call.
you can use solana-keygen-grind  to create a vanity address
https://docs.solana.com/
you can checkk out neon-vm but I am not sure how finished it is
hello is it possible to migrate ether js project to solana
Too bad, would love it to be in the same tx. But anw that's what we got. Thanks mate!
you would just have to break it down to multiple transactions atm unfortunately
its a hard limit right now. It might get increased in the future but that might be months from today
maybe it will help me
ok, thanks - I found getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress on solana/web3.js
there's HTTP end points for it too
possibly by fetching the transaction history? I think it's solana transaction-history via cli
hi, I have NFT like this 4HpnE7SfPtiTKMvd56LzzSkpzhNZEk4gJjhGT8KHUQGQ and I would like to read new sales on it with js. How I can do that? I can connect to <@!832686202074300446>/web3.js but I don't know next steps.
For what I'm doing, I sort of need more than 200k computation budget. Any chance that'd be increased in the future?
thanks, just managed to get the data with some trial and error. however got stuck at decrypting data as I was using python for my task. borsh-py under development unforetunately
You can use following function as a reference: https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/4a1b7d2f674013bc8bd3149294c66b03b27120d0/rust/token-metadata/test/src/main.rs#L173
Hey 👋 Super new to Solana! Was building on the Ethereum ecosystem so far. Question: could you share the Ethereum equivalent of wallet, node providers, SDK, etc. that I'd need to build a dapp on Solana 😄
is it possible to create a token with a specific mint address?
does anyone recommend blockchain / dapp development in the cloud? like something such as azure?
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library
How to add gas price to be confirmed first?
Is there any way to get the token program account info in the program through the spl_token crate?
New here and new to solana. I have questions 🙂 First
I noticed that royalties on NFTs are set on a token metadata level. Does that mean that any secondary marketplace needs to abide by royalties defined in each NFT its providing for sale through its market? On Ethereum for example this is entirely set and controlled by each marketplace. How is that on Solana?
got it, just needed to delete the keypair json, so it creates a new one on deploy
hi would you mind giving an example of open source solana contract? the is for education purposes
for local
Now trying to figure out how to actually increase the size with solana cli
Cheers
how do i extract my private key from the solana cli
you can only view source code  of program which is open source.
from what I understand the metadata program is to embed  metadata after a token mint? Is it possible to use the metadata-program in JS or tsx after I minted a spl-token? correct me if I have misunderstood those thing
How to find source code of open source program? I haven't found source code of "
Raydium Liquidity Pool Program V4" on https://solscan.io/account/675kPX9MHTjS2zt1qfr1NYHuzeLXfQM9H24wFSUt1Mp8

Just a quick question, I have decoded a transcation's instruction into hex but how do I decode it into JSON like the one on explorer?
Awesome, thanks again!
Definitely
Thanks for the reply. Yep, I saw this, so it looks like Metaplex is the way to go?
https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard
Did something like `RpcClient::new("https://api.devnet.solana.com".to_string());` not work for you?
Hi all, apologies if this is a stupid question, but is there an ERC721 equivalent for Solana? I have looked into both SPL and Metaplex but am still not sure how to ensure that a NFT that I am minting contains the required attributes/metadata in order to be supported by the main wallets and marketplaces. Thanks!
Is there a rust example that shows how to connect to a rpc url endpoint. Can only find an option to enter Ip but then it doesn’t use https.
either use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#simulatetransaction to fetch transaction log or lookup the source code of program for error code mapping.
Ok thanks
`solana-test-validator` is not available if you are using Windows
there are the rate limit about official nodes https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints
if your usage is more than that, maybe host your own node.
the most simple way is just encode it and print the length. 
if you just want to calculate, you can dive into https://github.com/near/borsh#specification
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturestatuses
this rpc will help. if it hasn't been implemented in sdk which you are using. maybe you can send a PR to it.
wondering how to approach debugging a program. I've got the error below. is there anywhere I can get more detailed log in order to investigate ?

I have installed solana and having all the main programs working such as 'solana', 'spl-token', etc... however I can't seem to find or open 'solana-test-validator' ... it is not being recognised
Cool, I created my own program and wondering if I can allow consumers to easily close accounts and get lamports back. While it's not precisely for the token program, you pointed me in the right direction. Thanks a lot!
my issue fixed by updating node..
Is there any free RPC provider that can provider more than 50 RQS? Or should I deploy my own node?

how can i calculate borshschema len ?
How to know whether tx succeeds in one confirmation? `get_confirmed_transaction` will wait about 19 seconds for many confirmations, `get_confirmed_transaction_with_config` is not implemented in solana-py.
can someone help me for this error. I'm at the webapp candy machine npm start with my .env file configuration

cool. gonna try this out. thanks <@!585868308419444749>
You can clone accounts from the public clusters, assuming you're using `solana-test-validator`.  See --help
is there sample data available on LocalNet, for example, USDC mint or Serum Dex program ? or do I have to create all these data/programs from scratch ?
I'd recommend getting things working well end to end on localnet, then deploy and test on devnet
btw, just wondering how folks here approach development ? do you do most of your development on LocalNet or do people use DevNet ? for debugging, you can only get log using LocalNet, is that correct ?
yes, it works amazing !
Nope. JustWorks ™️
how does explorer.solana.com connect to my localhost ? assume I had to use ngkrok or something similiar ?
Yeah just set the custom cluster URL to your localnet validator's RPC port
i missed solana explorer after moving from DevNet to LocalNet
is there anyway to run solana explorer for LocalNet ?
Ahh actually I guess I can create a list of instruction, each instruction pays one creator
I believe what they do is that they have each creator settle the account. So each creator has a to claim the payment
<@!585868308419444749> So I am using anchor framework and in anchor.

We just have a fixed set of accounts.
That's a detail of the metaplex contracts.  I'm not very familiar with them, you should ask in the Metaplex Discord https://discord.gg/PWpHQc7C
ahh got it. No, that's not the case, forutnately. (you are very helpful, thank you for identifying potential issues :P)
More of a problem if every interaction is updating the list
My question is, how do I pass a dynamic number of creators accountinfos into the contract/program?
Ah if it's a set once thing, that's fine
I believe N == 5. Or something like that
So this is the metaplex protocol

In the metaplex protocol, there is up to N creators addreses in each NFT. And in a transaction, I will have to pay creator royalty to each of the creators
Transactions that write that list will be forced into serial execution
Ok one follow up question.

I totally get how to write this if it is just one account.

However, in this case, I have a dynamic list of addreses. How do I pass them into the backend
You probably don't want to be maintaining a list of addresses though
Yes. Insofar as that is necessary to build transactions
Cos the front end has to load the account info, deserialize it, figure out which accounts need money and then pass them to the smart contracts
<@585868308419444749> So basically the javascript/web frontend also need to know the details of the contracts. Am I right to say this?
Ok so in my case, I actually need to have the client (the javascript/web frontend) to deserialize these list of addresses and send them in as an instruction
No. Contracts can't directly load `AccountInfo`s.  They need to be identified by an instruction so that the runtime can load them before execution
In a smart contract, can I use the rpc client to get accountinfo?

I have an account which has a data payload that contains a list of addresses that I need to pay to.

My desired outcome is:

1. Given the account data, I will deserialize it and get the list of addresess
2. For each address, getAccountInfo and then spl_token_transfer to the target address

Is this possible or advisable?
wondering what is everyone using for development: LocalNet or DevNet ?
okay wow so I had to cd out of my directory and now it owrks
getting this one now
Unable to connect to validator: Client error: test-ledger/admin.rpc does not e
sudo sysctl fs.nr_open=500000 worked for me
If this returns something, you can change your limit like the answer found here https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/640250/cant-set-ulimit-n-like-i-want-to
There may be a system imposed limit. Try to see the limit with `sysctl fs.nr_open`
getting this error
-bash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted
Try running `ulimit -n 500000` before starting the validator
Yes
From Solana repo root
does my local ledger just get stored on the folder i am working in? I'm just trying to run solana-test-validator from my folder that holds the hello world example
I amusing visual studio code on windows. My terminal is wsl
On Linux:
```Linux File Number Limit#
Linux systems limit the number of file descriptors that any one process may open. Solana requires much more than typical Linux system permits. So we have to increase this limit by adding the following two lines to the file /etc/security/limits.conf:

<username> soft nofile 500000
<username> hard nofile 500000
and rebooting. Make sure to replace <username> with your actual user name in the system.```
What's your OS?
Im trying to reproduce it atm. It magically disappeared
ERROR solana_ledger::blockstore] Unable to increase the maximum open file descriptor limit to 500000 - is that beacuse I have less than 500gb storage on my drive?
strange, can you create a github issue with more details?
hmm, any additional errors?
Thanks!
Here's a guide for the candy machine program which most folks are using now: https://hackmd.io/@levicook/HJcDneEWF
Thanks! I did see that but thought it was only for one off NFT and not whole collection
Most everyone is using Metaplex for NFTs on Solana. https://docs.metaplex.com/
Hello all, is there some documentation on ipfs for an nft collection? Trying to wrap my head around a how the token/mint work on Solana
Hello question about this. Which bin is this? bin from root directory (/bin) ?
I think the swap result isn't related to call instructions because there is slippage which will make them different.
Any ideas on how to fix this?
Running 'solana-test-validator' i get 
Error: failed to start validator: Failed to create ledger at test-ledger: blockstore error
oh ok , thanks a lot . Let me go back to the drawing board and think of a new mechanism
its just going to be hard to tie a reward to a specific action unless that action revolves staking tokens or paying with tokens w/o a big potential for abuse
i think a validation mechanism on chain is the best way to go
yes you can store the private key on the server and use that as the authority mint but that its own security implications
or my only way out is to come out with a validation mechanism on chain?
oh ok . but  would it fail if they are not able to sign the transaction? is there a way I can sign the transaction on the backend so that only signed ones will be valid? Is there a better way to just send tokens to someone without validating on chain?
but that has its own issues so iunno gl
unless your storing the private signing key on the server and only the server can generate reward tokens
im not sure if this is the greatest idea because someone could just call the rpc call a million times without doing that validation...
yes, its possible to decode and based on the program instructions. if your not able to figure out a specific decoding, many of the apps are sharing their source. If they are not open sharing decoding or their instructions, you can try their discord or contact them through their websites where available to see if they can provide some guidance on deconstructing their transactions for your use case. inc: <@!708603110330859592>. and in Serums case the instructions are in the source code and related idls where available as you mentioned.
yes , the activity is that the user submits a review and after we validate in the node js backend we make a call to the smart contract via rpc to send them the reward tokens <@!160231074268446720>
sure thing
similar to decoding on ETH using the contract ABI's I imagine
no way to decode the instruction data without having access to the actual program?
^ I would like to know too - this is only possible for serum right?
How to parse transaction receipt like solscan.io "Swap X SOL for Y USDC"?
1.22.0
which version of web3 are you using?
Hey, in my react app im getting this runtime error "TypeError: naclLowLevel.gf is not a function". The code thats causing this error is in web3.js/src/publickey.ts Line 250. Does anyone knows why this is happening?
in terms of your question you can mint and send the token to a users wallet in the smart contract
how will you know the difference between a user just calling an rpc call and performing an acitivty
what does "performing an activity" mean. Are you running all the validations on a backend?
I want to send SPL tokens to a user's account via my dapp for performing an activity, Do I need to use the escrow model to send my spl tokens to and the escrow will credit the user with the token or do I send it directly from the mint account without in the smart contract
exactly
like higher level things like "staked SOL/USDC LP tokens"
what do you mean by that?
Are you saying that you need to pay rent fro m either the user/contract side to support a token? If so, yes
im not understanding this question. A smart contract can just mint tokens to a user account without an escrow...
I updated my <@!832686202074300446>/web3.js library to the latest release, anyone else finding the Pubkey equality operator to no longer work? I need to .toString() first before comparing two Pubkeys
the token transaction list
Which part?
Checked the explorer, but the magic happens backend side, react client just shows it
there should be something like a SyncNative related instruction if you have a WSOL account already that should sync the native lamports with the SPL token account that may help in your situation. though not sure what part is not working for you. You at least need the WSOL account to exist to transfer to it though, afaik.
Quick question : Does all smart contracts have use  an "Escrow Account" if they want to send tokens from a mint account to a user account ? or is there another way to do it
Also is their a library of open source code like ETh has built
Does Sol allow dev balance management of their tokens like EVM?
let me know if you need a pointer to find that stuff, log parsing is in the simulator files
and there is code for log parsing there too
I just added a bunch of known programs to the solana explorer that you can use
but yeah ideally we use anchor-like idl's for this
feel free to copy out solana explorer code
the only other thing is if they have an idl you can just parse it because anchor has a standard format
its a shame that they arent more available
yeah i think those are hard coded
yes but that it's just a token list
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/spl-token-registry
uhh
it is not
and then write your own matching engine with the strings
i think you can copy solanabeach code its open source to get a list
oh i think anchor will have a solution soon with their idls but with solana you would need to hard code the tokens with the corresponding public key
Looking for something similar to what solanabeach does
so you know, from address to "RAYDIUM PROGRAM" _action_like_harvest_ _value_
crypto _trader_
haha yes, but need to create specific reports for my client based on 10k transactions like that one lol
this is pretty readable for me lol
basically, be able to process output from getConfirmedTransaction RPC endpoint
Want to tranform this into something readable
Hi guys, do you know if there's some open source log parser for Solana transactions?
if you are getting flaky behavior, an issue with details would be awesome
hmm yeah, but I think there's rate limiting in place too which you might be hitting
ok. Basically I launch a bot that subscribes to hundreds/thousands of accounts. I'm basically sending requests at < 4 TPS. After a while I get that socket not ready error. But in the end.. I'd still expect all subscription to be successful, right?
yeah it should
Does a Connection automatically resend the subscribe request?
```accountSubscribe error for argument [
  '6sqpL1b8zzF2gVa1g6xS81anueqxay8ub6s4k1UtjaC8',
  { encoding: 'base64', commitment: 'confirmed' }
] socket not ready
```
That worked! Thanks.
also are there any resources for live network cost estimations for program usage? thanks for any insight wrt this in advance, would be super useful to know for cost estimation for distributed stuff
> are the prices of deploying programs on the devnet roughly equivalent to the price for deploying the same program on live?
In short, yes, I installed rust, the solana tools, dev libraries, and so on. I executed that command in the root of the project. And, I'm running on Linux.
I'm re-running that test. I'll let you know. Thank you!!
can i import my file wallet into phantom somehow?
transaction format includes a list of signatures and list of accounts that are signers, we need to know how they map to each other for signature verification, so order is important
although account data is opaque, it's up to the program how it wants to encode it fyi
yes, there is an RPC method: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getaccountinfo
How to directly swap USDC to WSOL? I want to do this to remove creating and closing WSOL accounts each time.
It doesn't work if I update the mint address to WSOL's address from SOL's address and removes create and close WSOL accounts.
is it possible to inspect the data of an account for free, something equivalent to `view` functions in Ethereum?
if its a token account you can look at trying to use the 'closeAccount' function,  where you specify account and dest, along with some other params. this would be part of @solana/spl-token
just merged a fix, can you try pulling latest master?
were you able to install the following and run according to the instructions?  including cargo and the dev package?  what folder are you building and testing out of?
Is it possible to close an account and get lamports back through the web3.js library?
Can anyone point me in the direction of some info about creating a generative NFT collection and minting on Solana like Solarians? I’m coming from solidity/ethers and just don’t know where to start or what’s synonymous in SOL-land
why does the order of the signers matter when the fee payer is first?
Not sure if this is possible but I am hoping to add wasm support to the solana source code to allow it to be ran in a browser
Trying to take a deep dive into the Solana source code and I am trying to isolate the exact parts of code that both compiles the bpf binary and runs the bpf binary.

I would love help filling out solana.wiki if anyone is interested https://solana.wiki/docs/solidity-guide/introduction/
you can try the "inspect" button on the transaction page on explorer.solana.com if it was processed. Otherwise you can use the instructions here to inspect an unprocessed tx: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/inspector
oh that's cool, we don't have that yet
given the transaction hash
can check smart contract line by line, to see which line failed
or other debugging tools ><
what features does truffle debug have?
Is there a truffle debug in solana?
May I ask usually how can I debug when facing "invalid account data for instruction"?
Hey fellas, I want to get the metadata of a NFT token. I am calling "getaccountinfo" with "jsonparsed" and dont receive metadata info that can be seen in the explorer. What would be the way to get the metadata? Example:
https://solscan.io/token/GrsegDGanmvN93mcF37tzSDS7ZPmHaEjYsr4fqa2vj1w#metadata
how are program IDs supposed to be sorted for a transaction?
This would help return a pubkey to the caller but would not help in atomically figuring out what account is at the top of the crank and loading that accountinfo in a single transaction, no?
this will be supported soon: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/19548
right, sounds like a pickle for a creative solution. you might try the serum-dex source code for a potential pathway to a solution.  they have some interesting mechanisms in there, the events_loop in particular.
Since the crank is fast moving, its not certain that reading the crank state before making the transaction will present the correct element at the top of the crank at the time of transaction commitment
The goal is to make the operation atomic
you could try getting the info with a recent commitment   .recent()  ?
Hello, Is that possible to deploy a program from an other program ?
If I am creating a fast moving crank of pubkeys, is there a way to deterministically also load the accountInfo for a pubkey at the top of the crank?
Hmm so you cant return values from instructions? So you need to write it to an account, read it off chain, pass it to the other instruction? But what if the client modifies the returned values and passes bad data?
since the exchange doesn't know if that's the derived address or not, depending on your external wallet
from an exchange POV it's weird to support token withdraws
but part of the complexity is just making sure this is all setup to parallelize transactions effectively
using an associated token account (the current standard) is pretty indistinguishable from how erc20's work at a high level
yeah it isn't, I think that if we used PDA's from the beginning it would be more intuitive
system is cool but how token addresses work isn't intuitive
No problem, it takes a bit to see where the differences between solana and evm chains are
Thanks for your help 🙏 

Pretty cool system you have here 🙂
it's totally up to the program. Anchor is more Solidity-like and has standards for how this work
the most efficient way is for an off-chain client finds the appropriate key and then passes that to the program in the transaction
Is that for system-level programs only? Token program's enum is a u8. Does the program author define that type?
why?
the real amount on blockchain
the instruction type is a u32 not a u8
Yeah. But how do you iterate over them to find the correct key? That's what I'm trying to find. There isnt any good example on this
calc from raydium-ui for specific lp token

I asked a question in raydium, I don't know if someone here can help me?
hi
One random unrelated question that has been driving me crazy: I can see that the first byte in an instruction's calldata references the function index in the program's API enum, but I've seen three additional `0` bytes in all `System Program` calls -- what are these for?
currently accounts are not resizable
typically you use a new account for each key value pair
I'm trying to find an example for anchor  but I don't find anything
Is there any example how you can use PDAs to store key value things
yeah PDA's are used so that a program can control things like tokens and program upgrades just like a public key account can. It's very common for a program to set a PDA as the authority of token accounts (which are owned by the token program)
Okay awesome -- thanks for clarifying! It seems like both program-owned accounts created with private keys and PDAs are functionally pretty similar since both are only controllable by program functions... what's the rationale for PDAs? Is it that they can just be created and managed internally by program functions?
> So to create a PDA-based account, does the program you are calling need to have an internal function which either generates or takes an address and calls CreateAccount in System Program with it?
Yup, but just keep in mind that "CreateAccount" is just a combo of "Transfer", "Assign", and "Allocate". You can do them separately if you want. "CreateAccount" requires the balance of the new account to be 0.

> 5. The user's new trading account is created, but its state can only be updated by the account from step 2.
Technically it's the program that's updating the account. You probably just need to check that the account from step 3 references the account from step 2
So to create a PDA-based account, does the program you are calling need to have an internal function which either generates or takes an address and calls `CreateAccount` in `System Program` with it?

I'm imagining the following workflow:

1. Create program with BPF loader (e.g. AMM program)
2. Create account to hold state and link it to this program (e.g. a SOL/USDC market)
3. Someone else calls a function in the linked account with an address in instruction payload (e.g. their new trading account on the SOL/USDC market)
4. The account (step 2) uses program code (step 1) to call `System Program` with the new address (step 3). This address must be off the curve or the instruction to `System Program` will fail.
5. The user's new trading account is created, but its state can only be updated by the account from step 2.

Is that generally correct?
hello, so intermittently when i broadcast a transaction to the devnet public node I get the error: `Transaction signature verification failed` is that a known issue?
yes you are on the ground floor of the party in that domain. Hopefully you and other can contribute to a great future SDK in this regard. would be awesome.
unsure about the exact status atm, the docs state that `the current cap is about 35 accounts after accounting for signatures and other transaction metadata`, and currently, the proposal, proposal: https://docs.solana.com/proposals/transactions-v2#limitations  Max of 256 accounts may be specified in a transaction. Along with size and fees these items are constantly being evaluated and optimized.
<@!785084693023424542> awesome thank you! I just landed here https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/issues/90 which is what I was hoping to find but unfortunately doesn't exist yet. I started to extract the bits I need to build a custom frontend but it's going to take some time 🙂
the current typescript implementation is here: https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/js utilizing the web3 lib, and potential other API or packages are located here that you might be able to use: https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=metaplex, https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=solana. No other major 'SDK' exists yet, that I know of. 
Some other link contributions by the community:

How many accounts can be passed to a transaction?
when you specify the signer flag, it just tells the runtime to validate that the given address has a corresponding signature in the transaction OR that the address is a PDA and the caller program owns that PDA
Does anybody know if there is a Type/JavaScript SDK for Metaplex? I'd like to write a custom frontend
Accounts with public key addresses can only be created if a signature is included in the transaction which calls the system program
got it, so PDA means program derived address, that's not an on-chain thing. If you want to create an account which has a program derived address, the program must invoke the system program itself

Hi al,  advise on adding a name and logo to my token?
Look up program accounts in anchor
You use pdas and do it all on chain
so we need 2 signatures but ofc we wouldn't want the authority signer keys to be in the front end
Hmm maybe not the best way to do it then. What I'm trying to do is to create a "protected" program call where there is an "authority" signer (owned by us) and the "user" signer (the person using the client)
Not really clear how you would do it if you add the signer in the be and send it to the front end it’s a huge security leak
So you want to create a websocket to listen for when the backend finishes their transaction and then reuse that data on the client (?)
No so I want to create and sign a txn in my backend server, then send it to the clientside for the user to add their signature and execute the transaction
many thanks!
What server the contract (?) or you are intercepting the response in the server (?) if latter it’s basic api stuff. Pub keys are in base 58 and strings/other things  are serialized in base 64 from the rpc nodes
New one ☝️

Q: I'm trying to use `solana program write-buffer` (mainnet)
after sending all the transactions it briefly shows:
`[0/4300] tx confirmed. retrying in 0 slots` 
and then restarts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4WWQzOBNIg i had this dude helping me allot
yes it creates automatic generic -name. , thing is i want to name my token for the mainnet
how do you serialize a txn to send from the server to client?
Hi guys, I'm trying to mess around with a personal NFT project for university, when running metaplex ``metaplex upload . --keypair /users/(MY_USERNAME)/.config/solana/id.json -n 1`` I'm getting an error ``Error deploying config to Solana network. Error: Non-base58 character`` What does this mean? I generated a keypair and wallet using ``solana-keygen new`` and followed the instructions.
That's a complicated question. Depends on a lot of things like the size of the program (size used in a few ways here).
Never tried this so I couldn't tell you. But the SPL-token program does this for you anyway, it should be one of the methods of the program.
I figured out now thank you
Anyone??<:phillipamthor:854361020348366848>
Yeah you could do this using web3 js stuff, just send the signed data to the user. Just have the transaction form on the user side, then have them submit it. All you have to do is set up a "server" program which pays fees for contracts of specified type.
im writing my first token here on Solana mainnet 😄
guys any info on where name my token on exlplorer.solana.com?

Hello! I'm wondering if its possible to have the following workflow?

- Create & sign a transaction in the backend server from an "authority" keypair
- Send this transaction to the browser and have the "user" keypair send & transmit the transaction.

If so - how? (does the solana js library support this?)
I'd like to ask a question about C/C++ programs: can someone let me know whether or not we can add custom header files to our Solana programs (and have them utilized)?
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/75197
just import the phrases and the pubkey and maybe the password to a different wallet and get the desired secretKey
BIP44 is shared with many other wallet systems though, worst case scenario
They are deterministically generated.
Just copy it there, if you are using the solana CLI it should have given you the ID.
Hi, when i use solana-keygen to generate a new pubkey and secert phrase, and use the generated secret again to derive back my pubkey i get a different pubkey 😦

Does anyone knows what is the average cost to deploy a program ?
I ended up just building `solana-test-validator` and just running that directly instead, and it works now. Thanks
Cloning isn't supported by that mechanism, no.
Yeah, versions look okay. You might look at the boot log and see if you see anything suspicious around here: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/d2731a2d935103f9177a3d8ac934abc87f968c0f/fetch-spl.sh#L41
If this fetch fails, it will exhibit with that `Not Found` account data.
I believe I'm on the latest of everything:

```
(base) λ ~/repos/solana/ v1.7.11* spl-token --version
spl-token-cli 2.0.14
(base) λ ~/repos/solana/ v1.7.11* solana --version
solana-cli 1.7.11 (src:bdb77b0c; feat:1140394761)
(base) λ ~/repos/solana/ v1.7.11* anchor --version
anchor-cli 0.15.0
```
What version of the toolchain are you using? I ran into this issue earlier, and it was due to the spl-token release artifacts being named the wrong thing. Thought they were fixed, though.
I'm on an M1 mac and ran into issues running `solana-test-validator`, so I ran my local net with `NDEBUG=1 ./multinode-demo/bootstrap-validator.sh --log validator.log`. Is it still possible to clone from a public cluster this way?
You can clone accounts from the public clusters, check help
I'm assuming I need to do something because this is what `solana account TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` returns:

```

```
If I'm running a testnet locally, can I expect the Token program and the Associated Token program to work out of the box? Or do I need to do something to specifically deploy those programs to my local blockchain first?
gotya
It's default for legacy compatibility
The algorithm is inherently slow, it's O(N^2)
The account has a SOL balance, the explorer just isn't displaying it. Check with the CLI
but why is it considered slow? is there a benchmark or something?
How do we check if an account was recently closed before?
<@!670691246746107984> Just requires an update, def do a pull request there.

I have a question about custom header files in the c implementation: is there a basic example that let's me import my own header files into my Solana program? I've tried on my own and got an error related to an "unknown symbol reference". The "unknown symbol"  was clearly my test function from the custom header and accompanying C++ definition.
but again just a guess based on experience with other blockchain CLIs, SolanaCLI could be radically different in design for whatever reason
if you don't know what accounts are available to you there is probably another CLI command for determining this
it's probably something like: `solana account <insert account pubkey>`
<@!861711958616834098> Also try reading the CLI documentation and you should be able to find the command to do this

Hmm. Anchor/Solana isn't available on windows ? I'm trying to run `anchor test` and I get `Solana Rust BPF toolchain is not available on Windows`
apparently solana-test-validator requires glibe_2.27 and with centos the latest version according to yum is 2.26, anyone know if possible to get glibe_2.27?
In that it is 'state' is it possible you did not allocate any state data size when creating the account?
You should include a snippet but it is saying that you only have a slice of length 0 yet you are trying to get at something with index > 0

hi is solana-test-validator cannot run in M1?
the error details has written in the log. maybe you can take a look.

to change your cli keypair, you can use `solana config set -k <your key pair json file path>`

Yup something like this. But with this method, you don't get as much informations at ``getTransaction`` method
sorry perhaps i phrased my question a bit poorly. If I have a program account `EzSXQ2BXf8m4y4jcQQGeZ6nnwXB3ARXP3YQ5SwjKLj82` and go to the solana block explorer, you can see some metrics like last deployed slot, executable data, etc... (https://explorer.solana.com/address/EzSXQ2BXf8m4y4jcQQGeZ6nnwXB3ARXP3YQ5SwjKLj82).

im looking to fetch this information locally via the rust client, and hopefully on-chain
<@401880349166141441> can you send the link to this thread thanks
Hi! I just read up on rent today and I have questions..
some things just don't check out. I've long ago sent tokens to an account without SOL. According to documentation it should be purged within an epoch. however, everything seems fine when looking in the explorer.
So, How do I see if an account got purged? 
Does the account creation of 0.00204 SOL have anything to do with this?
Closed source for a project that holds 3 billion in TVL, are you crazy? 28% of the TVL in Solana ecosystem locked in a contract with no public team and no source code available. This represents a huge risk for the whole community.
i see you asked on Sunny discord, but just for others reference, Sunny is closed source.
there is NFT and metadata thread active.
maybe getSignaturesForAddress? If the transactions involve the same account.
how i can  add metadata to nft any one know how ? i can't find it in docs
Does someone know when I can find the source code for the Sunny Aggregator smart contracts?
How can you add metadata to a NFT?
Just like ``getTransaction`` but with multiple results ?
There is not method in the JSON RPC API to get multiples transactions informations ?
thanks mate, appricciated
Candy Machine is set up without programming by you. It takes some configuration files editing and using the command line. Best luck!
so a little bit out of my dept with Solana
and not really good with Rust and C
My programming language is python
I'll make my reads now, it looks like a lot to take in
thank you brother, appricciated
Or by searching this chat you can find foe example
https://hackmd.io/@levicook/HJcDneEWF
ok, I will check it out mate
You want a Candy Machine. Look for more info on the Metaplex discord.
I guess, like changing updateing the metadata
like in the other NFT lounches, where you don't know what propoerties, image and rarity your nft will have
I mean chanigng the image that shows from blacked out to the final jpg?
Reveal after mint?
There is no program id address book. Most commonly used programs have their id hard coded in the explorer code. Your best bet finding a program id is looking in the source code or docs of the program. As for the last deployment one strategy is to look through the Upgradable loader program transactions and finding the one that references program id you are interested in.
yeah, I would like to be able to mint the tokens, and then do revlea of the image after that?
why wouldn't you use Metaplex? Or do you mean by not using the UI?
Hi guys, hope everyone is well. How do I link an NFT to a JPG with Solana without using metaplex or others?
using the solana rust rpc client, how would you find the executable account for a given program, and the slot number the last deployment took place at? how would you fetch this information on-chain?
Does Sol allow dev balance management of their tokens like EVM?
how do we disable mint from web3?

I'm using a local net, and the latest spl-token-cli version, and I airdropped tokens to my wallet
thanks, I will. Will a created multisig wallet from this code, pass the condition wallet.owner == &spl_token::id()
yes thats the program Id for the spl-token program . resources: https://spl.solana.com/token and the linked githubs, along with the solana program library, token-swap, token-lending sources, and solana core. and solana explorer source code.   from CLI, web3, packages, and source codes.  Metaplex source also has usage and references
Thank you! I will look into this. I appreciate your help!
Another newbie question 🙂 I'm seeing this programId being used when trying to fetch all tokens for a wallet: `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`, is this like the main programId for a Solana token? Any resources I can use to get familiar with this?
See the solana cli. `solana program write-buffer -h`. That will allow you to generate a write buffer. Once you've done that, you can generate an instruction to invoke the equivalent of `solana program deploy --buffer` inside your smart contract. Here's the instruction https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/loader_upgradeable_instruction.rs#L102
<@!501570363566587905> Could you please share an example of the `write-buffer`  deploying another program. ?
thats probably a judgement call. if you look at the code you can judge for yourself. Im unsure on the latest audit status, but if your familiar with other software and platforms, audits dont mean guaranteed or bulletproof. various ones are being used. Solana has a multi signer capability, and an entire Governance program in the Solana Program Library. The anchor one is in use as well. All products as far as I am aware on any platform on any chain are use at your own risk.
It's not audited. I'd recommend reading the code and using cargo expand to investigate yoursefl.
We like the PRs
no harm in submitting a PR, for anything youd like to contribute
try this: getTokenAccountsByOwner
if your referring to your own transactions, 1 before another, send and confirm to await completion before sending the next transaction.

hi everyone! wanted to know how safe is it to use the project_serum/multisig program for production?
hello. i see that `Install node (v14 recommended)` https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/master/README.md#quick-start but at `package.json` it is locked by `"engines": { "node": "12.x" }` (https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/master/package.json#L48-L50). Should I make a PR round the repos to update from 12 to 14. 12 is in the maintained state, we should change to 14 is reasonable.
I want to get all tokens (fungible and non-fungible) from a public address using solana/web3.js, is that even possible? 🤔
Is there a way to get a list of holders of an NFT collection like you can in ETH?
How to make transaction be confirmed first in Solana?
Got it, and happy to; thank you for being so responsive!
yes this is why, it appears this example is not passing accounts.  the C examples are lacking and tend to be updated last due to the encouragement and popularity of the rust implementation. if using this implementation you may have to run locally with a modified version, and or contribute and update the example!
Thank you!
Do you know of any projects which have already implemented this, so that I can steal their code?
for curve references, you can reference the token swap source, among others, to see what is right for you:

https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/pull/823
<@!785084693023424542> The example as written in the available c code is not correct, so this is either outdated code examples in the main branch, or some sort of bug.
what is the bug/error that you see?
sol_log_parms is in the solana sdk: 
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/log.rs#L103
web3 documentation is still being 'beefed' up and improved. between the solana-program-library and solana source code most things should be quite trackable
<@!785084693023424542> Is there an update to this method? Also, where can I find the full documentation on the web3 ??? It doesn't seem to contain the info on the "built-in" functions in an easily accessible way.

I noticed a bug (EDIT: or possibly just an outdated code example) in the logging example for C: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/96b3b5691f05b6744f32ba0926f5e2b2bbf3534b/examples/c/src/logging/logging.c#L21
What is the right curve to use to implement market dynamics in a swap pool? 

I want to build an exchange for trading SPL tokens. 

How can I implement that the value of a given SPL token is 0.2 sol? 

Is there a way to use sol directly to buy SPL tokens?

can someone help me find the logging instructions in the API for the web3?  UPDATE: This is handled by the Solana SDK
The thing is my second tx might depend on the state change of the first tx. I'm not sure batch tx would work that way.
i believe the docs state that the current cap is 'about' 35 accounts after accounting for signatures and other transaction metadata. 
currently, the accepted proposal: https://docs.solana.com/proposals/transactions-v2#limitations  includes a Max of 256 accounts may be specified in a transaction. 
*Along with size and fees these items are constantly being evaluated and optimized

In either scenario, if you run into a cap, you would need to either optimize and or batch transactions.
I have this problem `encoded transaction too large: 1688 bytes (max: encoded/raw 1644/1232)`. I have about ~35 accounts in my transaction, I thought solana can support up to 256 accounts. Anyway to resolve this?
sounds great, thanks 🙂

I would stay away from that source. and anything showing web3 with exposing and or constructing private keys and signatures inline. they tend to be bad references and bad practice. tho it may be the general idea.

instead, for web3 sources, aside from Solana Program Library and Solana, 
perhaps: https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold
and source code for the solana explorer:
https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer
others:

https://johnnn.tech/q/how-to-send-a-transaction-to-an-onchain-program-in-solana-with-javascript/
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/19357 this describes it well and was reported 20+ days ago. Seems there is regression in the 1.7.x series of the cli deploying to mainnet. I downgraded to 1.6.x and was able to deploy.
```const instruction = new solana_web3.TransactionInstruction({
    keys: [ 
      {pubkey : account_signer_source.publicKey,        isSigner : true,  isWritable: true},  
      {pubkey : account_signer_destination.publicKey,   isSigner : false, isWritable: true},
    ],
    programId : pub_programId,
    data: Buffer.from([]),
  });

webnet?   
did you try it and it worked locally? on a local  solana-test-validator?
where are you expecting to see the log?
Thank You So Much for such a great suggestions 🙂
Is where the new keys are generated
<@!785084693023424542> <@!389214738271174656> I don't read Rust very well but it looks like: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/96b3b5691f05b6744f32ba0926f5e2b2bbf3534b/memo/program/tests/functional.rs#L23
ahh, then yes probably in your case.
this has happened in various, sometimes strange circumstances.  what were the conditions? any errors?  was this a cli program upgrade? to what network? any logs?
Ok so the changes since this article require keys now,  I've checked the updated memo example and they create new keys. But shouldn't we just use our client account key?
hypothetical approaches:
this really depends on how your payout, and logic, payout cap, winner calculation, ratio pool logic. If the winners have variable payouts that ca further complicate things. 

you could try, based on all your variables, something like the following approach starting with initial suggestion

What you can do, is per above. You use the concept of a vault program, or in some ways a pool.  
Approach 1:
1. accept deposit with underlying vault token (say USDC) payment fee for contest entry, say 10 USDC = 1 goku_token.
2. when user deposits the 10 USDC token in your vault. You mint them 1 gokuToken (a token you created for this program, which you can use to mint tokens for users, to use as a receipt for redemption.)
3. after the winners are picked. you upload the winners to an account associated with your program 
(so you save the winner data to an account (akin to NFT meta data))
4. you then post or let users know the winner have been selected.
5. users come and 'redeem' their entry goku_token, and if they are a winner, they get a prize

If you needed to log or store any other data somewhere else, you could do so before, or after, submitting transactions.

Approach 2:
You could alternatively, use this to store the user information (address), along with their player teams, and then have a service, perform the payout in that way.
but i really dont know how can i fill here and why :/
i think i need fill keys.
const instruction = new solana_web3.TransactionInstruction({

i have a this code
hey <@!785084693023424542> i think i understand you
I am using C version of helloworld
Is there any flag to be enabled to see the `sol_log` ?
I am unable see `sol_log("hello")`  after deploying on the `webnet`
hmm im not sure then off hand why you would get the error, though typically keys are passed, and this error indicates it was looking for keys in the program.  would have to investigate more. perhaps related to the memo program.   In the mean time, there has been updates since this post from last year, if your using a more recent version? May check off hand in the recent version of the memo program in the Solana Program Library, and reference it as to why,  I see keys being passed, from last I remember.. and this demo code, at a glance, had none.
Exactly!
so this is like fantasy sports betting. and you calculate winners based on team performance against other players that have 'competing' teams.  And this calculation is done off-chain, im assuming.  So you have 'x' number of winners, out of say a pool of 20 players, that get a disbursement from a prize pool of entry fees right, and winners are determined?
I got the same thing using the same code pretty much through the NPM package
This was error you posted, insufficient keys
Heya!
I'm trying to upgrade a program and it seems to just keep repeating sending the TX's - looks like it chewed up a bunch of SOL in the process. Anyone hit this problem before?.
which error did you get?
You can assume that they are paying entry fee using USDC. Like if in a league there are 2 users who paid entry fee of 10 USDC each, and then winner will get 20 USDC
<@!785084693023424542> The way I obtained the same error was using code found here: https://solongwallet.medium.com/solana-development-tutorial-program-101-2b168bffd541
You got it! Thank you!
are you having players use a wallet to submit a contest entry, with some token, yes?
normally when you build instructions you specify accounts (keys), along with programId and data.  what example works right when comparing this?

if you think its related to sysvar? new ways are here: when using sysvar there are new ways to access: https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/sysvars
or its abour rent**
but sysvar give that error.
normally for example memo is works correctly.
understand
why i need share my acc keyss i cant understant
how can i share account keys?
yes you can see my error message from here:

https://explorer.solana.com/tx/2g5hjb7vfLmMFxgE3GEiRBbDiMUw95hhrrYAvTgdyBPwy1wJP78saGZnWNwTZNgrc8bt2gQ3pCBSuuRqn6Ahb9jv?cluster=devnet
your instructions has no account keys? that error indicates it may have been looking for an account key to query..
Thanks for the reply!

Basically I'm trying to make a website where users can choose some cricket players for daily cricket matches and based on performance of those players in real life, users will get some score. Users can join a contest by paying joining fee. As currently there is no sports oracle to provide on chain data to solana programs. So my program have two functions, payLeagueEntryFee and distributeFundsToWinners. When a user joins a contest, he have to pay entry fee and after paying entry fee, his paid amount will get stored on database and after match result, we will calculate winners on our server and call distributeFundsToWinners function of deployed program on blockchain to send funds to winners from vault. distributeFundsToWinners takes a array of winner accounts and amount to transfer to them and this function is only callable by admin. Currently we are doing most of the operations off chain and using blockchain for transferring funds

Can you please suggest some better design if you have?
how coincidental! 😆
<@!785084693023424542>
^ yes I get this too
so you get this error in the client too? or you just see it in the transaction log output?  it throws this in the program:

hello everyone
Who knows where I can read about creating a pool for swap?
thanks , that will give me a good place to start!
what do you want to query?   here is an example: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getProgramAccounts
just curious, but this sounds more like a design related issue? 
is there some requirement for using a database to record a user paid fee? if so what is it being used for?  the program itself would not know of this record in that DB, persay, if its off chain without some additional functionality implemented. 

from the method given, it works much like a Vault program and the user receives a receipt (redeemable token), and form of contest entry payment.  if you deposit tokens in the form of a fee (say USDC tokens), and you mint the user 1 of your contest tokens GCT (GokuContestToken), the user essentially has a receipt (redeemable token), to prove their purchase and contest entry, and upon submitting this redeemable token to your program, your program can validate the receipt GCT token for payment or redemption for a prize.  

In either scenario, after the transaction is confirmed, you can simply log the entrance fee you passed, to your database, if required. Or if further required, query the token balance of the users token(s).
wondering how to query newly deployed programs?
here are the current dev resources list including python sdks: https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/763249718339567626
The metaplex discord may? have some more updates and resources geared toward metaplex NFT standard and use for py.
Thanks a lot! 

So let's say if user had 20 minted tokens before paying entry fee, and after paying fee he have total 30 minted tokens, so he paid a fee of 10. 

What is the best way to get this increased minted token amount of the user using javascript?  Because I want to store amount paid by user on server database. Do I need to get recent transaction for user wallet or what?
please provide any feedback on things you would like to see included in there as well, or what you think would be most helpful when transitioning, and if you can please contribute to it!
<@!466984915376799748> that guide is super helpful, thanks
I sent a link to a thread above, about NFT and Meta data, and more specifically these 2 links should be able to help, if your utilizing metaplex:
web3 NFT get metadata:
https://gist.github.com/dvcrn/c099c9b5a095ffe4ddb6481c22cde5f4
decodeMetadata: 
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/js/packages/common/src/actions/metadata.ts#L438
You could use a token to represent the fee that the user has paid. When they pay the fee, the program mints them a token that represents their enrolment.  That's one possible way.
thx
<@!445425471027544095> Can you please help me with this

I'm making an app in which user can pay some joining fee for a contest. I have made a function in deployed program which transfer fee from user wallet to program controlled vault. I have to store this amount paid on server database. What is the best way to check if the user has paid the fee or not?
Here's one example from the token program itself: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/96b3b5691f05b6744f32ba0926f5e2b2bbf3534b/token/program/src/processor.rs#L222
Great doc!. We were inspired by that doc to build Marinade.Finance fully non-custodial architecture. "turn the crank" instructions are open to any user willing to pay the tx fees
Yes you need to decode the data.  The account .owner itself is the token program, and the user that owns the token is in the account data
thanks!!!!
yes! thanks! oh I see, the link has no decoration in https://docs.projectserum.com/ so it's easy to miss
Are you referring to this https://docs.google.com/document/d/1isGJES4jzQutI0GtQGuqtrBUqeHxl_xJNXdtOv4SdII/edit ?
<@!785084693023424542> I have one last problem. From a spl token account how to get it's owner? I called `getAccountInfo` on it and checked the .owner but it returns "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA" instead of the real real owner. Do I need to decode the data attribute?
I have a doubt can anyone answer it please

I'm calling a function of deployed program using web3js, and that function is changing data of an account

I'm reading the data of that account using javascript, after how many seconds (after calling my program) should I read the account data to get updated data, changed by the program?
<@!501570363566587905> question: I remember reading a document from Serum describing Serum's "turn the crank" mechanism, and how all the "turn the crank" instructions could be executed by any user willing to pay the fees, and that's key to make Serum non-custodial. 
I can't find that doc anymore. Can anyone remember where it is, point me to it?
<@!785084693023424542> thanks a bunch it worked!
i hope
this should fix it
yes i ran it from  the js folder
oh
you said u ran it from the js folder?
`And after that, you can publish the Metaplex app to GitHub Pages by the following commands:

cd js/packages/web
yarn deploy`
?
should i run it from web folder
?
cd js/packages/web
yes i changed it to my github
did you see this? https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/docs/deploy.md <@!828385808260005940>


i ran it from the js folder
ahh. which directory did you run yarn deploy from?  may need to be the same as where your script ref is located. I dont recall having to add anything to a default deploy.  is it metaplex?
i need to add deploy:app to the package.json?
i meant the part where it says no packages found with the lifecycle script deploy:app
if this is related to a yarn deploy for metaplex, the metaplex dsicord may have a better idea, more details, and some chat history to search for comparable errors. otherwise, it does say file or directory not found, and that looks like its trying to access or find this folder when its doing something and it could not find it..
the supply of 1 would likely come from the Mint address (token, token mint) showing total supply. 
if you have the address of a created token account (that holds the balance) or your looking for information on an address for an account in general, you can use getAccountInfo. https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getAccountInfo. with NFT there may be 1 or more accounts, like meta data account associated that has other information. Metaplex also has potential other information. Which may be easier to find how to find certain NFT related items, code snippets, and search the chat histories there.  

In case. here are a few links related to NFT and Metadata:
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/886259112105635940
maybe try with getTokenLargestAccounts ?
this happened after yarn deploy
can someone tell me what does this error mean?
Is it a function like findProgramAddress where I could give the SPL's token address and get the list of holders?
<@!785084693023424542> Ok thanks. I have an SPL Token Address, I know that this token has a supply of 1 (it's an nft), how can I found its holder?
whats the exact error and balance of the paying address,  on what network, and is it the same network your existing balance vs the one your making calls on?
hey - i'm running a basic token transfer method (via `splToken.Token.createTransferInstruction`) and running into an insufficient funds issue. the wallet i'm calling `web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction` with has plenty. is there something i'm missing? thanks!
Buffer.from("metadata") is prefix for Metaplex contract and it's a constant:
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/f11659cb43f65effae2f471d5c9b09266cdd4fa8/rust/token-metadata/program/src/state.rs#L10

TOKEN_METADATA_PROGRAM_ID.toBuffer() is address of Metaplex on-chain contract, also constant:
metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/9d5a5c6d668cd9c597cff8c63dfba00dee2f72f0/js/packages/common/src/utils/ids.ts#L65

tokenMint.toBuffer() is token generated by spl-token program:
$ spl-token create-token
thats a good question for the Project Serum, #anchor channel. I'm not sure there is a difference.
it is deconstruction:      addr,  nr =   find program address takes the meta data information provided, essentially the 'seeds' (buffer.from("metadata", etc.., and the program address (id), and constructs/finds and creates an address of the program for you. its a derived address from the program address.  it returns the address found (addr), and the nonce (nr) that was used.
"metadata" and token program id are always known, tokenMint account is usualy generated by you.
for example this code snipet work, but I don't understand how we construct the first array
```
const [addr, nr] = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
        [
          Buffer.from("metadata"),
          TOKEN_METADATA_PROGRAM_ID.toBuffer(),
          tokenMint.toBuffer(),
        ],
        TOKEN_METADATA_PROGRAM_ID
      );
```
I don't understand how we use `PublicKey.findProgramAddress` can someone explain please?
Hi, how do I do CPI to a non anchor program from anchor?
I would think this would be a fairly basic thing I would not have to ask a question on. I know on EVM chains it's straight forward, copy private key and paste in web wallet, and bam you can use it.

But it is different, and I can find no information on this in the documentation. Or anywhere on the internet.

So far the most information I have found on this is someone on reddit asking the same thing, and someone confirming that yes, they are different... with no help given...
On explorer not yet, try SolScan.
How can I see the json of a nft I see on solana explorer?
Hello 👋 
I am setting up an NFT project and would like to see if they show up correctly in my wallet.

How do I use the same wallet on Solana cli and Phantom?

Private keys are different, one being string and the other an array. I tried restoring from the recovery key I got in the cli as well and it gave me different wallets on phantom.
Please don't ping directly.
<@!785084693023424542> I'm just dumb. I decided to let it load for longer, and after like 20 minutes it loaded. I'm using an external ssd, and sometimes I underestimate how slow it is, lol. Although it did throw a "Unhandled Rejection(Error): Not a valid mint." Looking into that now.
Awesome! Thank you <@!501570363566587905>  I will look into this. Thank you for the quick response. May I ping you again for further questions if needed?
does anyone here know any nft market place allow to buy and sell nft on devnet, except solsea?
any errors?  or just says loading.. forever without anything?  does anything ever show up in the browser, developer console?  is the port/localhost blocked or in use for some reason? did you try another port?
You can use the `write-buffer` mechanism to trigger deploys.
Yes, effectively.
Hi there! Did you ever sort this out? Is there any info you could provide around this?
When I use yarn start in the dapp-scaffold after building, localhost never resolves. Just remains stuck loading. Metaplex storefront works though.  Any suggestions?

how long approximately to produce a block for Solana?
I am tempted to just use a `useEffect` in react with the connection state dependency
Hi everyone, what's the consensus for how to handle network errors within the Connection context? ie. if the network is unreachable or the websocket disconnects. I see that the Connection instance is utilizing rpc-websockets underneath. Essentially I want to show a dialog when the network is unreachable
Thank you for your time!
There's some information about the anatomy of a transaction here https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/transactions
These are general TypeScript/eslint errors that aren't specific to web3.js or what you're trying to do. You'll need to learn how to use the types expected by the code you're using.
Is there any documentation around that topic?
what API should i use
Whenever you are creating a transaction, you require accounts, instructions, and signers. The instruction included looks like it creates an escrow account as part of initialization.
how to get all token addr under a nft collection?
how can i fix this error?
Guys, anyone know why the property instruction is passed:
```
await program.rpc.initializeEscrow(
      new anchor.BN(initializerAmount),
      new anchor.BN(takerAmount),
      {
        accounts: {
          initializer: provider.wallet.publicKey,
          initializerDepositTokenAccount: initializerTokenAccountA,
          initializerReceiveTokenAccount: initializerTokenAccountB,
          escrowAccount: escrowAccount.publicKey,
          tokenProgram: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
          rent: anchor.web3.SYSVAR_RENT_PUBKEY,
        },
        instructions: [
          await program.account.escrowAccount.createInstruction(escrowAccount),
        ],
        signers: [escrowAccount],
      }
    );
```
trying to mint an nft is very slow and take more than 60 seconds
It's everything working?
we ran out a few weeks ago, but not at this rate
weird that the testnet faucet isn't getting drained as well (or is it?!)
rate limiting harder seems fine, 10 devnet SOL per day or something
We can try something like that 🤔
Maybe we allocate 10 devnet SOL for every IPv4 address, and that's it 🙂
I'll do that too
different IPs, we rate limit by IPs and addresses
We can rotate the faucet keypair, maybe somebody got it 🙂
or post somewhere that devnet tokens can't be turn into real sol 🤦‍♂️
Do we know if there's just one server that's not rate limited or something?
I guess we can rate limit even harder
That's not going to help at this rate.  The rewards don't come in that fast
I'll work on what we discussed yesterday
here the token account address will be the one on the  top right? not the wallet address
Hello, does anyone have experience deploying a private Solana testnet? I am running into a number of issues. Could use a hand.
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/examples/create_mint_and_transfer_tokens.js
here the fromtoken account and totoken accounts will be the  sending and recieving wallet addresses right?
if i want to transfer 1 token from fromtokenaccount to totoken account
is this correct?
```
const  transaction2= new Transaction().add(
        
        splToken.Token.createTransferInstruction(
          splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
          fromTokenAccount,
          toTokenAccount,
          selectedWallet.publicKey,
          [],
          1,
        ),
      );
```

Requesting airdrop of 1 SOL
Error: airdrop request failed. This can happen when the rate limit is reached. 
Oh 1 also cant probably all gone 🤣
Yeah some clowns bot it, so everyone gets to suffer
My bad i didnt know theres a limit 😆
Thank you!
Oh... <@!315330485544812564> you're requesting too much.  1 SOL/req
Please tell me the 2M SOL I put in it yesterday is gone 😂
sent!
EdvXW5ukJmyoeEgoreogt76ZZhc6Yt6iL97H1tFLzmwq
that would be great, i needed to test something haha
i can send you some if you want
This can happen if the devnet faucet is empty
Never airdropped any in the past
Any idea how to fix this error ?
Requesting airdrop of 10 SOL

thanks!
got it
oh
There's only one example to give 🙂  https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/program-id.md
can you give me an example?
The public key of the SPL Token program
can someone explain to me what is a token program id
what are you trying to accomplish?
what do you mean by fork?
Can someone help here?
Hi guys, I am reading about programing model of Solana (https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs), but I  do not understand why e.g. struct Secp256k1SignatureOffsets for Secp256k1 Program contains key offset and instruction offsets, which seem to me having a fixed length. Could someone clarify it?
I don't think so
Is there a way that I can update the space of a program account after it has been created?
Ill check it out, thanks!
When you say evicted, you mean removed before sent out to the appropriate validator?
You can read how transactions are handled on validators here if it helps https://solana.com/news/gulf-stream--solana-s-mempool-less-transaction-forwarding-protocol
in solana, is there a period that tx data are stored on the RPC nodes until the data is evicted?
NFT and Metadata resources:

Yeah, it is back @here
It appears to be back up now.
Here's an example from the sol-did project which used borsh for public keys -- you'd just have to substitute the solana struct: https://github.com/identity-com/sol-did/blob/ce794ad298e41e3fc96eecae4975c3b9ef5c48db/client/src/lib/solana/sol-data.ts#L476
😩
Seems that everything on the solana.com domain is down, including solana.com itself. 🙄
Hey, is it possible to get all NFTs and their metadata connected to wallet address?
it just picks a wrong key somehow
no error. yeah i have the package
Is there a way to make sure that only one specific program can execute an instruction in a different program and restrict other sources from executing it?
Second ^^ was just about to ask
@here https://docs.solana.com/ is down?
So my understanding is that all NFT tokens are SPL tokens! For which we’ve to fork SPL library and add on chain! I tried that on Devnet and it still shows unidentified token. What I am doing wrong?
after this I want to send the recieved tokens to another account how would I do that
am I doing this right?
```

can someone help me write a transaction
yeah devnet & others seem down for me too
What appends with docs.solana.com? -> This site can't be reached
is devnet currently down?
can't check http://status.solana.com/ either
Pff I'm having trouble using https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/python-api
Devnet just seems to reject my tx or something. I do get 200 messages, e.g :

```
>>> metaplex_api.deploy(api_endpoint, "A"*32, "A"*10)

'{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": "3mU5grw2YytP8wiPoZfFeg8ahfrinX11Td2kZ6tfeB3EC4CQcvPw1zaH82qmbuDbzzFMwMYEL1kq6S1gNt447nx6", "id": 2, "contract": "2sL2Ei2Gno2eoacKdHQkDzA7d2osWpuvXqVqxkcgBU6a", "status": 200}'
```

But if you check tx `3mU5grw2YytP8wiPoZfFeg8ahfrinX11Td2kZ6tfeB3EC4CQcvPw1zaH82qmbuDbzzFMwMYEL1kq6S1gNt447nx6`, there is nothing 😦

Same with properties files link
Or for animation url should i do vr.glb
I'll fill address in after

Does this look correct
Can i get some insight on my json data for uploading glb files with candy machine
Are there any console errors? Do you have the package for ledger?
SOL-USDC LP is just another SPL token. You should be able to transfer using the spl library in js
Example here: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/aef1e239b37f5547c2c86390f204da41b0965adb/token/js/examples/create_mint_and_transfer_tokens.js#L52
is there something I can do about that ?
hi here, I have an issue with the solana wallet adapter on the frontend. It works perfectly with sollet, phantom and other wallets, but if I plug my ledger, it doesn't pick the correct keypair
anyone?
can anyone help me with a sample code for sending a raydium sol usdc lp from my wallet to another wallet?
So I guess, this is the max, what you can withdraw
Your delegated balance on that account is:
2.9995
You tried to withdraw 3.0019... but you only have 3.001811.. on that account

"Program Stake11111111111111111111111111111111111111 failed: insufficient funds for instruction"

The error is that there are not enough sufficient funds, but there are clearly enough funds. 

$5 in SOL if you can help me figure this out 🙂

I've switched to using BufferLayouts
Okey, thanks you ☺️
right. if you see, your result - 'data' is the buffer | ParsedAccountData object.  this itself needs to be parsed, like the output your seeing below - essentially showing this for you. this needs to be done on your end.  checkout solana explorer for a cool way they do it:
 https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer.  Lots of good code and web3 references here.
search for `getParsedAccountInfo` `ParsedAccountData` `AccountInfo`
is there some project providing an API or is there a basic way of getting to do it yourself ?
also, what is the most common way of getting market data from the solana network ?
Thanks, this is very helpful. Is there an RFC or a PR where I can track progress or effort towards having something akin to interfaces in Solana
can we do this on C or is restricted to Rust ?
thanks
token-swap in: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library

Hope it's helpfull
I believe in the not to distant future there will be things like program interface, for further customizing and doing things with token. Right now creating and exploring a custom token is possible, it just is very likely it will not play nice or have unexpected results in the eco system. It does not work quiet like ERC20 Tokens at present, in that you can take a token interface or type of token abstract class and just implement and customize it.
hi guys, is there any example on how to swap a token on solana ?
what does your code look like? and what does the result look like?
Hey, how can i get values from "parsed" in getParsedAccountInfo ? TS always say propertie Parsed does not exist in value 😦 (Using web3 lib)
should be unix timestamps in regard to utc. time zone independent. should be all over the documentation. which part of the docs were you referring to?
Found the info, it's UTC
Does anyone know please what timezone is a solana TX in? (I mean that timestamp) Could not find this info in the docs
Thanks for the reply! So if I understand correctly, it's not sufficient to implement the interface (same  instruction signatures). The bytecode has to be exactly the same. Or is it even more restrictive: you have to use the deployed `TokenProgram` otherwise any integrations will require custom work
Hi guys, I'm writing a react-native mobile client for an on-chain program. The client uses solana/web3.js SDK. From what I can tell, the web3 SDK has dependencies that depend on some core node modules such as crypto, http, https e.t.c. Some of these modules are not included in JavascriptCore which is react-native's Javascript runtime environment.

I've tried adding polyfills for the missing modules but I can't seem to find a working polyfill for the crypto module. Is there a way to safely add the right polyfills for the missing modules in react-native or a separate react-native solana/web3 SDK I can use?
I can't find any examples out there for serialising the PublicKey, but I would have thought this is pretty common 😅
ok thanks lisenmayben, will give a read ... much appreciated
solana decode-transaction [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <TRANSACTION> <ENCODING> ... yeah am interrogating an account, so this may not be suitable as it targets a transaction i think
"borsh": "^0.6.0",
"@solana/web3.js": "^1.27.0",
I've also tried using  ['owner', 'u256'], ['owner', [32]] and ['owner', PublicKey] without defining the PublicKey Schema
also, web3 for that route has a bunch of decoding examples, as well as the solana explorer source mentioned above: https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer. if you look for references of decode, based on your encoding, and structure, if its not already plainly readable and jsonparse not working or too large.
Same issues unfortunately, it seems to not like me adding PublicKey to the list inside of new Map
you may want to do something with log subscribe or query the logs and apply filters if your covering a lot frequently on some kind of timed basis.  im not sure how advisable or reliable web sockets would be for tracking all deposits across all accounts - that seems excessive and maybe unnecessary. transaction signatures https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress can be retrieved like this. You may want to reference the Solana Explorer source code (https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer) for the types of things it does, or ideas, and see how you might apply its methods in combination with some of your own.
but you might have another error there
ok sure, will do ... yes it's a RPC JSON API call (getAccountInfo) to the account that was written to (by the helloworld program I deployed) ... I am expected the value to be 'hello' but every time I put it into an online decoder I get '????' ... i've tried decoding for base58 and base64, whist jsonParsed just defaults back to base64 - i have not tried solana decode-transaction -> will do now
try to update to the latest for borsh and web3.js
Ah it doesn't even compile, theres a huge error block
"version": "7.15.4" for web3 I think
"borsh": "^0.4.0",
and what versions of borsh / web3 are you using?
what's the error?
try when you can pasting the text where you can in small buts using '`'  and '`'  one the ends. and not use images if possible so that it comes up clearer and can be search. 
is this an RPC call ?   what are you expecting? and what are you trying for decoding?  
did you try solana decode-transaction? or what form of decoding have you tried?
still no luck <@!539801435571748868>

Tried also like this
this depends heavily, but validators can work different here and usually start from a trusted snapshot, and not necessarily like how others work in many cases.  generally you do something like get and start from a trusted snapshot and 'catchup' check <#560174212967432193>
I know you can dump the program and then reverse it locally, but not everyone can do that
that's probably a question for the devs 😂
<@!194280119710253068> thx, but how can we trust dapps on solana if we cannot check their smartcontract?!
No, Solana contracts/programs are BPF loaders compiled to assembly
if jsonParsed dose not work, what's the best way to decode base64, I find the online decoders don't work (unless i'm doin something wrong)
Yes most do. NFT and MetaData resources: https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/886259112105635940/886269376196657172
😅
Do you know what I should use in place of 'u256' if owner is a PublicKey?
Currently you can not view source of a Solana program vis-a-vis disassembly. However; many programs source are open source and viewable
kind: 'struct', 
        fields: [
            ['initialised', 'u8'], 
            ['owner', 'u256'],
        ]
its in the works, something to be more user friendly. anchor framework has some 'IDL' and friendly approaches atm. cc: <@!388143265813364736>
Hello everyone! I'm trying to create a lightweight SOL/SPL-token deposit watcher for Solana. The block-by-block processing is really not the best way, because the 400ms blocking time and the parsed json network transfer time. So I'm trying to implement a websocket based watcher. I have two problem regarding this way:
 - I can subscribe to programs (1111 for sol and TokenkegQ... for spl transfers), but the ws result is not contains the signature/txid. Is there any way to get it somehow? 
 - I also try to subscribe to "ATokenGPvbdG..." program to catch spl account associatons, but to my biggest surprise this program doesn't send any message via websocket. What did I wrong?
How long time to start a validator node, including syncing all history data.
`PublicKey` is borsh serializable in JS already! https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/2762f6f96f28271f02f05f0f438a870fae3bb660/web3.js/src/publickey.ts#L201
Hey guys, maybe a stupid question, but is there a way to check solana smartcontracts like we can do on etherscan ?
I'm trying to serialise a struct which has public keys as fields

Is there a standard for publishing the ABI of a program?
hi, is it possible to mint/airdrop some wrapped ETH/BTC/SRM on devnet?
Borsch Schema type for PublicKey
Hey guys, anyone know what type we give to public keys in a borsh schema in JS?
NFT question: Do most projects in the space use the metaplex NFT standard? If not, how to they attach metadata (img, etc) to the spl.token?
This was actually happening for any interaction with my program. It nearly drove me insane but here are the steps that finally fixed it:
- `anchor build`
- `solana address -k target/deploy/<programname>-keypair.json` to get generated program id
- update program id (`declare_id!`) in `programs/src/<programname>/lib.rs` with the output
- might also need to update `Anchor.toml`
- `anchor build` again
Only then you can deploy and it should work. Maybe it's just me but it wouldn't work otherwise
you can take a look at https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-start
and https://docs.solana.com/clusters
Hello

Can anyone help me for create 2 validator on different machine?
I think you can simulate the transaction. if your transaction's blockhash is too old, it will return your a error "Blockhash not found"
I am aware of that, but that's not what I need. I'm trying to get a token that would be present in the spl token registry, found here: https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list
Minting my own tokens doesn't achieve that sadly :/
not sure, but actually you can mint your own token on devnet so that you are your faucet!
https://spl.solana.com/token
maybe try http://localhost:8899 or use -ul (a short for --url localnet) in your deploy command
I found you use http"s"://localhost:8899
sorry I meant from the client side e.g. web3js
after 32 blocks, a block takes about 400ms to produce
are you create the account and assign its owner to your program ?
it seems you want to modify account's data but the account's owner is not the program.
bump
Solved it, wasn't using the devnet
gm everyone, simple question I'm getting a rate limit reached when trying to airdrop myself 1 SOL any ideas?
nevermind, i just chenge to http and it works
Can someone help me here. It works fine when i deploy my program to the devnet, but i want to deploy to my localhost network?
hey is "seller_fee_basis_points": 3, setting royalty fee 3%?
how long (milliseconds ms) does a transaction have to go through at max? given that its contents are good, I mean when (ms) can the blockhash be too old? is the when (ms) a dynamic property?

my goal is to space out retries while sending the same transaction, when I am absolutely sure that the previous transaction didnt go through
What is this error: `The given account is not owned by the executing program`? I'm getting it when I'm calling a function on my deployed program. There's no error on localnet and everything works fine there but on devnet I can't do anything because of this error.
Where can you view all the tokens?
Wow, thanks a lot 👍
is there any guide on how to integrate web wallets with website?
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getParsedAccountInfo
How can we get the mint address from the token account using web3 connection?
seems you have already run a validator, use  `ps aux | solana` to kill the exist ones.
Thanks @chido
check `solana-keygen grind --help`
and `solana program deploy --program-id <your-key-pair-file>`
in solana you can take a look at https://docs.metaplex.com/ for NFT
there are some resource in <#763249718339567626>
what are you trying to do
what do you mean "verifying them after they are crated"? In the process of them being created in the first place, the transaction has to be signed
signing is verifying them after they are created ser
what is "sign the nfts"
does any1 know how to sign the nfts?
solana-test-validator error, any tips?
on deploying my solana program, can i have a custom program id?

devnet not working
Hello! I'm having problem with spl-token create-token . I was able to use spl-token command but when it comes to create-token, it says it can't find the specific file. How should i backtrack if I have installed things correctly? 🥲 i'm quite sure that I have my keypair in one of the folders and pubkey
https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1438227504007979011?s=21
so the only option is to upgrade to latest mac and retry everything normally.
Mentioned on the solana docs that docker is used for dev purpose only.
OK after a lot of debuggin, I found out that in macOS sierra which is not supported anymore doesn't recognise the signer source.
on devnet, explorer show transaction is finalized but web3 throw 30sec timeout error
anyone having trouble with the web3 confirmTransaction?

And this is for all 6 tokens that I tried to use on devnet/testnet
What is the issue with this?(
hey how long does it usually take for a transaction to reach the finalized stage?
Does anyone know how to set the Default Signer?
Morning chaps!
Thank you!
No, it does not show every token on the platform. Currently, PRs are reviewed in bulk and can take up to two weeks to be merged.
New to solana and have a few questions (maybe more later). Does token-list/solana show every token available on the platform?  If so how often does the pull request get added? Thanks and my bad if this is the wrong place to ask.
Hey anyone using wallet adapter know is it possible to sign and approve a transaction without sending and let the server side send the transaction? the signTransactions method did only sign but not approving in the phanton wallet
tried solflare its working Thanks
thank you!
You can use the `getAccountInfo` RPC call with encoding set to `jsonParsed`. https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getaccountinfo
Hi, have a CLI question.  I have tried to RTM and google the answer, but haven't had much luck.  

I have created an NFT.  How can I use the command line to send the NFT to another address please?  I assume it's similar to SPL-tokens as well.

I have been able to transfer SOL easy enough.  Thank you
Thanks:D
that `digest` is error is because Chrome disables the crypto library from non-secure domains, use another browser or create https certs
I'm experiencing a problem in generating accounts for tokens when exchanging nfts. Can I ask you to check it out? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69189945/typescript-error-in-the-solana-chain-solana-transaction-in-testnet
Is there any way to get that `3P9ov1WhoriSQoui9XREpWkVSmALpnqKuuLhAEJN1w1f` ?
How can I programmatically retrieve the mint address from an account? 
For example here: https://explorer.solana.com/address/He5NxBeewAKkmKvZgPL9FYF4UHqqoawd5Kg5gccr4Tuo?cluster=devnet
solflare can do this automatically, on phantom you'll have to ask the receiver to do this I think
You need to create a token account first
NFT and Metadata resources: https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/886259112105635940/886269376196657172
any ideas why in a CPI call, one has to specify the list of accounts twice, one in the instruction and another in the invoke() method. Seems quite redundant. Also the former requires account_meta[] and latter requires account_info[]. Just trying to understand why it's been done this way.

let ix = Instruction {
        program_id: target_program,
        accounts: vec![account_1, account_2],
        data: [u8]
    };

    invoke(&ix, &[account_1, account_2]);

Can't transfer NFT through phantom wallet in devnet . Does anyone know what might be the isuue
Is there a guide on how to create an NFT token on Solana? I have an artist friend who would like to experiment with Solana. I'm new as well but have a good grasp on Rust. Any advice or link to helpful resources is greatly appreciated!
Btw you can go to Ignite_build_a_team
Can I join your project just to see How things work? I am very new and just want to learn
did you see the https://spl.solana.com/token documentation?
 It runs through the token program and operations for tokens. 

the SPL-Token is the token standard like ERC20,
you create a mint account (create-token)  and can mint tokens (can also mint-to)
you create a token account with the mint to store the balance of tokens for an address
you can use this created token account to transfer tokens from the owner address to a destination token address
in general, the key pair (wallet, or generated keypair) is used to sign 
you can transfer them yourself as a signer, or through delegation or approval

there is more to it but those are basic things. 

the token swap, lending, and oyster repos have a lot of functions that show transfers, deposits, withdraws. https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token-swap
but a transfer is as simple as :
//   from account (address), to (address), from owner (keypair/signer), empty (multisigners), amount
Token.transfer(testAccount, dest, testAccountOwner, [], 100);   // from js file in the token source

here are some potential ethereum solidity -> solana resources:
https://solana.wiki/docs/solidity-guide/introduction/
https://www.notion.so/Solana-Rust-Intro-for-Solidity-Devs-e27d881a14794a3199514336ee032d0c#eb143eaecb5c4ff4a5d7129826df83c8

its different than solidity and ethereum, there are some comparisons and things familiar. 
have questions just ask

the docs, examples, and learning resources are improving.
if we are looking for solana developers to help on a project where would we go
No way ! I've been drooling over the new processors waiting for the release of the new macbook pro . So I don't know from experience.
Solana currently doesn't play nicely with arm, but works fine through rosetta
Good choice ! The M1 is the best valued mac ever created . For development  you wont have any issues  , just remember your running on an ARM.
Keep in mind that if any of the commit levels fire from the signature subscription you can assume its been picked up by the RPC
What's your use case ? When you say dropped do you mean not picked up by the RPC node or not fully finalized on the network?  The commitment levels just determines what stage you wan't a response from when the subscription status of the signature changes. So if you'r trying to get the status of the transaction to display the status of the transaction in your UI you could send the transaction without confirmation and  subscribe callback methods to onSignature for each stage (Commitment) of the transaction.  I can see the transaction not getting picked up by the RPC as an issue for the user since it will only fail once the timeout has been reached.
Given an NFT address, how can I get its mint address using web3?
My last project was a DEX in solidity and compared it with the token example https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token  from Solana to understand how to transfer token between each other in Rust within Solana works. Did not understand iyet how it works even with the example. Maybe a short documentation or just a graph for the examples would be great . But I just started several days ago and I will check some other documentation and tutorials
is it because of learning the rust language? or something else?   there is also the anchor framework for solana that might be easier:  https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html
many have had issues with M1 because of the specs, cpu, architecture, but you should be able to run and build from source in most scenarios if you do happen to encounter any issues.  an M1 user might be better able to speak from experience.
It is good 😉
I am buying a macbook air M1, Will it be good?
If I read Rust then I feel it is different and I need to train. If I check Solana I feel I have no idea about anything :-))
linux, mac, and it helps to pay attention to the specs!
Which is the ideal Os for developing Dapps on Solana? Windows or Mac?
For every time you call `msg!(...)` no matter how long the logged message is?
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/runtime#compute-budget
the details should be in the budget.
if your logging with msg! it gets expensive. I believe on size, but I dont remember off hand.  
you can log compute after each call to test.
sol_log_compute_units
metaplex discord: https://discord.com/channels/848060988636921856/849844496941842432 try there with some more details and any errors you might be encountering
How is log compute calculated? Is it per character? Per macro call? Per line? Some combination of all three?
If it returns `null` for longer than the `recent_blockhash` is live, the transaction has expired
That method would better be named `getTransactionConfirmation`, it will return the transaction result or `null` if it's still pending
How come it does not load my local store info I setup on my laptop. Config is the same
https://themodernlogicgroup.github.io/metaplex#/
do you need to handle retry and checking for program->program calls through `invoke` as well? Or would that be fine because it's already in the same tx (so the same block)
I deployed to GitHub pages hosted metaplex but it’s not loading wallet .env store info in my repo. Www.Themodernlogicgroup.github.io/metaplex/
and is there any commitment value that ensures that it gets to a finalized block? Also what is the approx time for a block to finalize?
Will `confirmTransaction` https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#confirmTransaction confirm that the transaction hits a finalized block?
Yeah nothing get's dropped once it hits a finalized block.  There are plenty of ways for a submitted transaction to never get to the leader, or for a transaction to get into a block in a fork that is later abandoned.
Haha definitely would help, I don't have a link but several people have asked about it in the chat now, and we confirmed with the Solana Dev team and our private RPC node provider that this is an issue
it would help a lot if you had a link to the conversation if it's public 😄
ah the RPC nodes drop connections?
I think it has more to do with the RPC nodes than the blockchain itself
These are great questions...
also does that also hold true for `invoke` and `invoke_signed` from within programs?
if that's the case, the clients and sdks should automatically retry tbh, instead of having everyone shipping their own retry logic
any functionality in the eco system that references or validates according to the spl-token program id likely would not work with your custom token. SPL, and other things like meta data for tokens from spl-token list or other sources like NFT Metaplex standard are many times referenced specifically by address/programId, a package, or a library, because its encouraged as a standard, among other things, so again would likely not work with your custom implementation, as is.
Agreed this is why we are trying to figure out what is the safest and most "safe" way to confirm transactions
Don't have a link was over zoom
Additionally wondering what is the best commitment value for confirming the transaction: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#Commitment
a blockchain that silently drops transactions sounds horrible
can you send a link to the conversation?
Confirmed this today with Solana dev team
I'm wondering if its possible to check that the transaction was dropped vs some other error from happening.

Works now ser. Thank you to the RPC overlords.
It should detect if the transaction is dropped. It’s just using a timeout to determine if there was a failure. It wouldn’t be much code to retry the transaction if an error is thrown .I’ve never deployed to mainnet so I’m not sure if it’s truly necessary .
wait what, mainnet drops transactions? where did you read that?
I am personally still trying to wrap my head around it honestly still. I am trying to understand what is meant by transactions getting "dropped", and more importantly how to detect that. If `sendAndConfirmTransaction` detects and throws an error when a transaction gets "dropped" that is amazing since we can just use that. Just need to verify that that is the case.
Confirming and Retrying Actions
I might not understand the issue , can you send a link to the repo with the solution you found . Off the top of my head the confirmTransaction method does most of that work for you .
you def should be able to seeing as how you can use https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter with any network specified, as long as your wallet has support for changing networks you can see the updates - like in phantom.
I have this EXACT same question (even found the same repo with the retry logic) lol. Came here to ask it and see your post right away! Would love to get some traction on this or collaborate with people on coming up with an  open source solution! Overall the "retry" part of this isn't hard its more about HOW we detect that a transaction got dropped by the network.
I'm learning about the `TokenProgram` and I understand that it's just static bytecode and every token would call it and specify its own mint authority, input accounts etc.

My question is about what happens  if I deploy a program that preserves the SPL interface (implements all the instructions) but has different semantics and... bytecode. Then, would that create obstacle to seemlessly integrating with existing wallets, or other on-chain programs that accept SPL tokens?
How much time does it take approximately to produce a block for Solana
Hey! Is it possible to use `'@solana/wallet-adapter-base'` with a local net?
because each would need their own 10MB
hey all, program architecture question here, if I'm trying to break up a large program would it make sense to create 2 (or more) programs that trust only each other bi-directionally?
Why is it that I have my program id declared via `declare_id` and yet every time I deploy to devnet I get a new program id? It works fine when testing locally (id is always the same, as declared)
I have heard that mainnet drops 8-9% of transactions, so I need to make a retry logic for transactions that drops. 

Is there any typescript code example for reference about retry logic?

I have found something related here https://github.com/project-serum/solana/blob/master/banks-server/src/send_transaction_service.rs#L59

But I want similar logic in typescript, please share your thoughts how to do this

Thanks!
`web3.Keypair#secretKey`
you can get it
Might be a nooby question, but is there any way to get your private key (not recovery phrase) from your solana generated key pair? Using the solana CLI. Trying to import that address into a web wallet like phantom that requires a private key
I am new to solana. My concern is that: maybe I am doing something wrong and everybody else implements something with Rust 🙂 That may be the reason for why web3.js isn't ready but nobody complains
Make a task force (or a discord) with other people who uses web3 and maintainers. I'm sure they'll socialize it if you ask nicely. you're probably not alone!
I really wonder that am I the **only** man who develops something with Solana web3.js There are many missing RPC methods, no documentation, no example. I consistently read source code and debug solana explorer etc. requests 🙂
I am trying to deploy my first anchor project (the tutorial) and am running into this issue
I am getting this error

Does anyone know how to set a keypath for anchor
yeah, you'll have to try a bunch of things -- if you develop some metrics, we could probably incorporate them in our testing tools
anytime!
oh boy, it's not intuitive as I thought haha, thanks a lot jon, got it done.
Thanks for the suggestion, that's what I'm thinking of or a trie, or a bunch of maps. I haven't developed a sense of what's expensive and what is cheap in Solana-land yet.. 😄
Ah, I see -- `preflight_commitment` only covers the simulation, so you'll have to set the commitment when creating the rpc client with `RpcClient::new_with_commitment`.  we may want to make this clearer, i just got tripped up by it researching it
I'm using Rust client, this is the right format right?
hm, very strange, maybe the websockets are acting up, or the configuration was done in a different place and it didn't take effect
I've tried all the options, even when I go to `processed` it's still 30-40 slots behind. I sent this when slot is ...130.
Absolutely, you're currently using the highest commitment level.  Depending on your usecase, you may be able to go to "confirmed". More info on commitment levels at https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#configuring-state-commitment
That's exactly right.  Recovering from an error in `invoke_signed` incurs a lot of overhead in the runtime, so to keep things quick and simple, it's currently impossible to do so
finally some progress
solana balance <PUBKEY> worked
solana balance wouldn't work
then I had to add my pubkey everywhere to get it working
which different to what it showed.
I need to create the keypair again and try to retrieve the pubkey
My tx is normally confirmed after 30-40 slots after I sent it. Anyway to make it confirmed sooner?
Thanks for the support <@!785084693023424542> , finally got it to work.
Have a question about calling `invoke_signed` from a program running against the test validator - my expectation was that I could call `invoke_signed`, and if the call fails, I could map / log / inspect the error. It seems like no code can be executed after the failing call to `invoke_signed`, however. Is this expected behavior? Something like if any system call fails, the program immediately aborts?
Or! you can try some sort of a sorted list or skip list
For now, transactions are charged based on the number of signatures verified, and otherwise they all get the same amount of compute.  This will change in the future though, and it'll be possible to pay a higher fee for more compute soon.  If you can get it to work with the current compute limit though, you'll be golden. Try those memcmps and see how big your vec can be
And so my program will likely have to exhaust the full set of registered addresses (say it's 10MB worth) which makes it a very gnarly product problem if it creates higher tx cost
It's probably in the docs but are the costs of executing a lot of operations passed onto the users like in Ethereum?

One thing I'm concerned about is that for my use-case, the worse case is the normal-case. I'm checking that an address _is not_ a member of a set. And naturally, the set is very small compared to the space of all addresses
Neat, thanks this is very helpful
only if you need to, of course. you might be fine with normal comparisons
so for that, you can use a vector under the hood, and do something even sneakier: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/1db4604c8dba5707dacedaea7ab4dc695c82b8d0/stake-pool/program/src/state.rs#L521 -- deserializing a Pubkey and doing the comparison is much more expensive than memcmp 😉
as basic and obvious question as this is, i just wanted to confirm that in theory it's impossible for a transaction to be executed without the assistance of any type of program (e.g.  smart contract) independent of the fee costs ... e.g. each transaction contains a set of instructions that will always require AT LEAST 1 program to execute, and then validation and consensus is another thing after that comes afterwards
both using -v with commands will just output verbose logging where possible to get more info.  usually this is just a path error of some kind.  the solana config not having the right path, or the program pointing to the wrong place to find the config (?) perhaps.
did you mean run the keygen with -v or the solana address with -v?
<@!466984915376799748> ?
Thanks jon. So if I understand correctly, I will basically load ~4Kb at a time and then iterate through my map that way. I'll probably go for a smart structure.

I essentially need to do a membership check (is Pubkey in `Set`)
What is the problem:

`curl https://solana-api.projectserum.com  -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
  {"jsonrpc": "2.0","id":1,"method":"getBlocks","params":[0, 10]}
'`

returns:

`{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32601,"message":"Method not found"},"id":1}`

<@!466984915376799748>
yes, you are able to create accounts inside of programs. It is common practice.
For now, you'll have to be smart about deserialization to avoid blowing the stack and even the heap.  Remember, you'll have all 10MB available to you in the account, so you just need to be careful and only look where you need to.  The stake pool program manages to iterate through a vector of roughly 300kB by casting pointers to types.  It could probably do better if it didn't need to do other logic around all that.
did you try running with the `-v` flag?  I would like to think its as simple as the program not looking for the file in the right spot, and possibly the env variable not setup correctly somehow.    You could try to reinstall, with default. and make sure the path variables setup correctly according to the install instructions.   if you just to keygen new, without the path, it should generate a default one in the default path.
Hey guys, I just started learning Solana today . Was wondering if your able to create accounts from inside programs or is this not a best practice?
maybe look at the stake pool program. it handles rewards by a token  and a offchain agent for cranking the distribution. https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/stake-pool
can I uninstall and reinstall?
ok will try
try using the default keypair..  in your output:  generate another keygen,  but use id.json
solana-keygen new -o /Users/cryptosang/.config/solana/id.json
your config path got set to the other devnet2.json, according to the output above.
maybe there is something wrong with it.
<@!466653755404714024> the error no default signer, usually means it cannot find this file, keypair, in the expected path - thats why it is asking you to run the keygen, which should output the file in the expected path . its almost like some install, path or env variables got crossed.  is this a fresh first time install, running from the same install path and the environment variables for the install are in your path variable?   

what about if you run the commands with a `-v` flag, for verbose. do you see any other clues?
Hi, is there any well know NFT market in Solana?

it is giving me a suggestion solana-keygen new -o /Users/cryptosang/.config/solana/devnet2.json
rpc stuff, not on chain programs, lol
i have someone wanting to get into solana dev with python, is there a recommended package/lib/etc people like?
it sounds like you dont have a valid keypair, and or the path to the keypair is not being found
No default signer found, run
what about cmd: `solana address` ?  does it print a valid one?
yes I generated new ones
I am using mac version 10.13.6
do you have a valid keypair?
its throwing this error
when I try solana balance
its throwing this error
iam try to verify publickey with the keypair json
solana version: 1.7.11
what are you doing  that results in this error?  error log?  what version are you using?
To be able to send them to a program would require me to have them saved somewhere though...
I dont think that looping through a long list of account is even feasible in a instruction. You have to maybe mark them as writable  and send them all to the program. I think the limit is 256 accounts in a instruction.
spent a whole day setting up solana - argh!! almost want to give up
but when I tried on my mac it is not verifying the public key
I need to know how much collateral is in the liquidity provider's account so that I know what percentage of the reward to give away to each provider. To do this, I must be able to loop through their accounts and get this information... if I wanted to store a list (or some data structure that I can loop through) with this information within my program, would adding more PDAs help, or is their a way to do it nicely using the heap?
I tried using Docker and it is working on Docker but stuck at metaplex cos of the binary issue
does anyone get this error on mac?

https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/issues/200#issuecomment-917686433
I would store the info about the account in the pda ( ie amount of reward , date , amount ) and process the reward on the demand of the user.
Could I store a data structure globally on the heap that would hold all of the information for the liquidity provider's collateral accounts? And then have like an accessor instruction in the program

Hi anyone using solana and the local solana-test-validator on M1 Macs?
Got it!
Interesting, could you go into more detail? I could make a different PDA for each one, but I am still not clear where I can store the info for those PDAs in order to loop through the collateralized accounts and send the reward...
Latest 1.7 toolchain works (best)
Some info about heap https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/overview#heap
1.6.something?
hmmm.. so to deploy contract to mainnet now.. which cli toolchain version should I use?
One strategy would be to make a PDA account for each one.
I am looking for a Rust dev for nft minting smart contract. Website and nfts are done 👌🔥
If that's the case, what's the typical workaround. I can  make smart serialization and data structures but it will only take me so far right?
Am I understanding correctly that the stack frame limit of 4Kb means that even though I can store 10MB of state in my account state. If I try to load a large map (naively) I will explode my stack limit? Or is there a special provision (a... heap?) that I can use to go around this?
Hello everyone, if I’m implementing a program that allows individuals to collateralize tokens to provide liquidity, and I want to be able to send rewards to these liquidity providers collateral accounts, what is the best way to store the public keys for all of the accounts so that I am able to send the rewards? I’m struggling because I want to store them in a decentralized manner. I considered making a new smart contract program with a state that could encode them all, but there is a limit on the size of data an account can hold and there is no bound on the number of potential accounts. What other ways could I stored this information decentrally?
You should probably build some tooling to directly consume an accounts snapshot
Good odds that a request with a 500MB+ response is going to kill a validator if requested over RPC
Thank you! <@!585868308419444749> <@!455114989397868556>
Besides, our use case. This is needed to support "public" Metaplex storefronts -- storefronts where there's no creator whitelisting. 
I'll jam on this for a bit, and also touch base with Jordan and Bartosz.
Let me think about this for a few. I see that it's a Node buffer issue. Which means that to support `getProgramAccounts` on the Metadata program  there needs to be an update to the `Connection` class / getProgramAccounts -- to use a Stream object rather than just regular string when getting the response.
Thanks!
I thought so - as I'm trying to generate a wallet in the CLI and use it in the browser.....but I will check there too
is this development related? if not please use <#694949720644124762>
But shouldn't it show the same public key between what gets output in the CLI and what you see in Solflare when you import the private key?
Yeah probably.  It's like 10k accounts per drop
We do. It's for a cache service. It's actually for our mobile NFT wallet. We only need it once to build up the cache then just update on updates.
use the CLI to get the pvt key from the account and once you have a new phantom wallet there is an option to import from private key
Hmm ```getProgramAccounts``` was working fine a few days back, we had cached the response and only updated it on account changes. Didn't notice this issue until recently when we upgraded our service. I think it has to do with the increase of NFTs.
Tried with the security passphrase and it did not show the same public key.  Which derivation does the CLI use?
Can you apply a filter? Surely you don't actually need every account
If you generate a wallet with the CLI - how can I import to Solflare or Phantom?
There's no way to paginate the response.  I'm somewhat dubious as to whether it's paginatable at all.
THANKS!  And NEVER!

Hey guys, I have a little question.
How a liquidity pool know who have made the deposit and how many tokens? It have an account where save these informations? How the fees are splitted over the pool?
check out solana.com/developers for some good introductory material. look into anchor framework by project serum if you don't want to learn rust right now
Ok so I need to learn rust, will be on it. What else?
C++ devs have the easiest transition to rust, so you're in luck
Any language or stack pre-requisite that I need to get started?
We are only calling `getProgramAccounts` on the Metadata program. 
If there's a way to paginate the response, let me know. 
We need all the Metadata for our Metaplex indexer service, which is then used to cross reference with user accounts to get the NFT manifests.
So Guys I want to become a Blockchain Dev but don't know where to start.. I know python and C++
Is it possible to stream all finalized transactions? I'm looking at onLogs, onSlotChange and onRootChange websocket methods but nothing seems like a great fit
What's going on with the DevNet airdrops?  I can't get any SOL in my wallet
Why do you need a 500MB reply?
Hey guys
Feel free to let them know in the project serum discord.

https://discord.gg/3zAwVbjE
Anchor is a framework. it was not created by solana labs.

Hey y'all, is connecting to a websocket supported by the js lib? I'm getting a "Only HTTP(S) protocols are supported" when trying to drop a websocket url into the `connection()` method
Ok thanks ... but for some reason the problem was solved after redeploy the program
Are you using our flavor of llvm and defining `__x86_64__`?  Will take some modifying, etc.. .to get it to compile out of the box
Oh. Never?  Or up to you
I think I didn't explain very well in my last question ... what I was asking is how often the a program reployment need to be done ??
Not usually (has never happened IIRC).  The software upgrades don't touch on chain data
So when you guys make any Solana upgrade, we need to do a redeployment of our program?
No more than once per slot AFAIK
I already solved the problem by re-deploying the program .. is there any specific amount of time to upgrade the program since the last deployment ?
perhaps there is another way to make these assumptions or do we have direct access to this information?
we have to assume _some_ information about the run time environment
I need to select architecture based on sys variables, but if there is another way to do so please let me know
stub.h and stub32.h and stub-64.h, as previously mentioned
AFAIK that's not an error from core
Can you paste the entire output of the `sendTransaction` reply?
Hey, I'm having the same issue. The error is only happening in mainnet, devnet and testnet is ok. Should I rebuild and re-deploy the program? Have anything changed over there? I'm kinda lost now.
Hi there, Im having the same issue as <@!784409462282518539>  I have a program deployed on mainnet-beta and right now any Ix of the program is working fine .. I am getting the error: **InstructionNotAuthorized**
In case you want to add your use case: https://github.com/near/borsh-js/issues/34
ok, so that discards it from being a browser issue
Hello need help !! .. I have a program deployed on mainnet-beta and right now any Ix of the program is working fine .. I am getting the error: **InstructionNotAuthorized**
node
Are you trying that on the browser or node?

similar but I am the writer
"basically" won't cut it 😉
I understand there are sys calls and threads in the code but I've removed basically all of them
<@!453347985628200960> I've sent a DM
My code look something like this :
```
**taker_account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? -= amount;
**main_account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? += amount;
```

but I can't git it to work. I keep getting an error : `sum of account balances before and after instruction do not match`
Ah okay, thank you!
Does anyone has an example of transfering lamports between 2 accounts in a solana program ?
Unfortunately mainnet is still on v1.6, we want to upgrade to v1.7 as soon as a lingering memory leak bug in v1.7 is squashed
Hum so I guess mainnet had a downgrade and getSignaturesForAddress is a 1.7 feature, using getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2 works
should be fine so long as you weren't `while true; do solana airdrop 1; done`ing the thing
abusing? No, sir ))
as far as I know at least. I have a few DEFI running. I'll try to switch them all off.
If by GNU you mean glibc that covers a broad array of APIs including a lot of system calls.  What are you trying to accomplish?
I have a weird bug, when i use the function getSignaturesForAddress(web3.js) on mainnet-beta I have an error, while on devnet it works for the same code  
```
throw new Error('failed to get signatures for address: ' + res.error.message);
Error: failed to get signatures for address: Method not found```
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/issues/426 any idea of this?
GNU for example
but I'm trying to figure out what can and cannot be used
agreed
Ah, yeah, you can't just pull in the stdlibs in full, they include a lot of incompatible pieces that make system calls, etc... (threads for example)
How would I import those?
<@!453347985628200960> After getting the LLVM compiler do you just want me to include the static library in my cmake command (in the lists of libraries)?  For example, the stubs.h file also has 32 bit, x32bit, and 64 bit counterparts.
do the libraries themselves have to be configured for BPF in any way?? Or can I just use standard C++ libs (for my target system)?
^ is an example
usr/local/include/c++/v1/__config:1114:6: error: "No thread API"
#    error "No thread API"
if that's ok?
I can post them here
plenty of things come up
<@!453347985628200960>
That depends, programs run in a restricted environment.  No system calls, limited heap, limited stack frame, instruction caps, etc...  Besides that most libraries should compile fine to BPF.  You'll have to try compiling the specific library and see if anything comes up.
has anyone been successful in implementing the web3 NFT get metadata? I'm gettin this error after implementing everything from the gist:
Mmm. Interesting. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction 👍
What you can do is slot subscribe https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#slotsubscribe and getBlock to understand what's going on in each block https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getblock
I'm developing a project around DeFi charts and analytics. I started with Ethereum and Smart Chain blockchains. In this cases I'm running my own full node. And with a code like the following I process every new block and its transactions, so I can extract information for charting and notifications.

```
web3.eth
.subscribe('newBlockHeaders')
.on('data', ({ number: blockNumber, ...blockHeader }) => {
    web3.eth.getBlock(blockNumber, true).then(block => {
        block.transactions.forEach(tx => {

            // Analyze transaction: contract creations, DEX router, DEX add/remove liquidity, ...

        });
    
    });
})
```

But when it comes to Solana I'm a bit lost. Is there any way to achieve something like that? Even, does it make sense? At the moment, I would prefer going without running my own validator, due to high cost of hardware (maybe soon). I'm also considering services like QuickNode, but I don't know if it's possible this kind of websocket subscription to *every* block.
Ok thanks
I think you need to read the wiki article I linked you in <#428295358100013069>.  Understanding what a loader is would make you understand that using more than one of them is not even wrong
No.  Your program can only target one loader
np. we were all new once 👶
"Different BPF loaders may require different entrypoint"

Does it mean we can use multiple BPF loader version ? And we can use multiple BPF Loader in one program ? Is it right ?
Ah, I hadn't seen that there's a cli tool! This looks really promising, I'll see if I can do it with this. Thanks for that. And sorry, I'm like brand new to Solana.
Are the CLI tools sufficient for that?
You can see it being used here in web3 https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/web3.js/test/bpf-loader.test.ts
I should probably elaborate what I'm trying to do. I've created a cluster on AWS scripts found in the solana repos ./net directory, ultimately hoping to load test against it. I want to validate that that my cluster is working properly by performing some create, read, update operations against it. Is that possible with the JSON RPC API?
My understanding is that the BpfLoader can be used to load programs on chain.
I was think i sent in wrong place, sorry
Don't crosspost, you've been answered in <#428295358100013069>
What exactly is BPF Loader ?
I read doc but i did not understand
No.  The API would have nothing to do with it.  Keys should never be generated remotely.  BIP39 and BIP32-ed25519 are fairly accessible in most languages. There's no excuse to hand them off to a third-party-controlled server
Hey <@!585868308419444749> I just wanted to thank you for all of the help with the spl-token multisig. We worked out all the kinks, and finished our validation tests earlier this morning. I just moved the first of our Star Atlas NFT assets over a few minutes ago. https://twitter.com/dahifi/status/1438884852783357956

I'd like to build out some more tooling, I've been getting more proficient with bash scripting and I'm hoping to make it a bit easier to manage all the parameters for our two multisigs and various kepair signers. I'll keep you posted, thanks again.
Also, thanks for your reply 🙂
Hmm ok, I'm very new to Solana. So the API would deal with keys, i.e., what outputs belong to which keys, and client would manage those keys in an account. Does that sound correct?
No.  That's a client-side task
Hello, is there a way to create an account using the JSON RPC API? Can't seem to find a method for that.
Much appreciated - thanks for directing me
Both <#763249718339567626> and https://github.com/icarus-initiative/icarus_initiative/blob/main/resources.md have a large amount of resources for new developers
See <#763249718339567626> ?
Hello Solana Gurus! 🤓 
I am collecting a **mega list** of **introductory developer resources**.  With the Ignition hackathon going on, lots of people need help getting started writing programs.
Send me your **links**! If you've seen a cool tutorial, example repo, video -- I want it! These will be made public.
Hello everyone, we need a person who develops a smart contract for Solana NFT. 💵
WFM.  Were you abusing it?
It wouldn't  be too horrible to write myself but curious if you folks know of an SPL client written in Rust that I can use out-of-the-box
Sorry, not sure :/
gotcha
SOL is native, not SPL Token
I've tried even with 0.5 -> same result 😦
Noob question: what is the token mint address of SOL?
thanks, I found a python implementation, but I'll see if I can do anything with this one here: https://github.com/dsprenkels/sss-rs
You can use a standard SSS library over the dalek secret key
Anyone know a keysplit or Shamir’s Secret Sharing setup for solana keypairs?
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/67FjGvZekPbj4cp14k9SeGV52gv9cHEPuoJ89toMdc7Dorhu8Av4FxUMcgn3wKTfs2YbyvZEAkzfcz26TU4EVGEj?cluster=devnet

I can't deploy program to devnet , It seems to be created a buffer
Check out candy machine. Not really sdk but template for metaplex IIUC
Limit is 10 for airdrop
Hi, I am looking the source code of solana about mempool and how the priority architecture works. Where is the file located in the repo? <:tinfoilhat:809110749141663754>
Is there a metaplex rust-sdk?
yep
thanks a lot, i will give it a try!
first of all, that wallet paying for your user transactions should hold just enough to accomodate user requests
security by isolation would be something to consider here
Yea I guess that makes most sense but it is still pretty dangerous. Next AWS data leak and, potentially all of my company's funds are in jeopardy.

Perhaps this. Create a multisig wallet. One signature needed in order to mint the NFTs which sits on the backend and the second one is stored in a cold manner and two signatures are required to access the funds in the wallet. 

Am I making sense?
I mean, you definitely don't want to store your private key in the front end, you could for instance use a back end or an aws lambda / cloud function that executes the transaction that you'd call from the frontend with credentials
https://images.app.goo.gl/9uqQ6BW94R357XieA
looking through the SOL documentation and wondering if there's a way to set the max length of the list returned by the `getProgramAccounts` method?
hey yall
Would like to get some opinions on this. 

I'm building an app and one of its functionalities is minting NFTs for users which I pay for. Meaning the user gets it for free. In order to do that I need to connect my account.

Here's is where I'm still not sure of what I should do:

Whenever a user earns an NFT, I would need to mint it for them and then send it to them. In order to do that I would need to sign those transactions but how can I can automate that process without compromising my secret key? Any opinions of methods to execute this?
The string vector resides in the accounts 'state' data. When you open the account again you'd fetch the program account with the data... similar to:
```
const account = await program.account.baseAccount.fetch(baseAccount.publicKey);
console.log('All data: ', account.dataList);
```
hey guys, I am getting this error while starting the local validator. Any pointers?
maybe you are talking about interaction with a program from a explorer like on eth? Not yet. We still don't have a ABI standard, although some programs made using Anchor can have their client interfaces exposed on chain.
Images are mostly stored on the Arweave chain but can be any uri. Data ( metadata) is stored inside of a linked pda metadata account. Read more about it at http://docs.metaplex.com
ug pull creaccoun
Can I store my client on the blockchain and point an explorer to then load that client?
Hey dev's ! just have a doubt on how NFT's are getting created. In solana NFT is like just another token changing the decimal to 0 while creating token will make it NFT. But how an image is getting associated or linked (whatever it is i dont know the exact term) with that NFT. Basically how an NFT image is getting created

Help, please 🙂
Im trying to request airdrop to devnet. It keeps failing: "Error: airdrop request failed. This can happen when the rate limit is reached."
This the data i want to retrive from the chain, next time i open the app
how can i retrive data from a transaction. I made a program "hello world part 2" https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-solana-development-with-react-anchor-rust-and-phantom-3291, where i add multible strings to a vector, so the program can save it to the memory. Will these strings be saved on the chain, if so, how can i retrive them and convert it to strings again?
if you account still a system program's account, you can use `assign` to change its owner, also before you assign to a new owner, check the `allocate` for enough account space.
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/SystemProgram.html#allocate
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/SystemProgram.html#assign
oh. I think the main idea is to design a mapping relationship between the wallet account and the program account which will be interacted, you can take a look at `findProgramAddress` for some idea.
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/PublicKey.html#findProgramAddress
just like ATA, user don't need to store his token address because the calculation always return the same address if you provide the same mint and the same wallet pubkey
Is there a way to set the owner?
<@!788215642070581289> I am getting the following error - Caught failure Error: Transaction failed: Account does not have correct owner
if I wanted to connect https://github.com/project-serum/sol-wallet-adapter to sollet extension, rather than sollet.io - does anyone know what the `wallet provider url` should be?
Hmm I am already using the wallet adaptor. But the problem is if the program wants to do something to an account’s data, how would I be able to use the same account across browser refreshes? I am using Keypair.generate(); to create the accounts. Would the user need to save the account keys manually?
any suggestions..?
'npx pkg . -d --targets node14-macos-x64 --output bin/macos/metaplex' did not help
Okay thanks for your help, will try with devnet
Hi guys. Working on a NFT project on solana blockchain, we are looking for a dev. Interested in DM
maybe use devnet to continue your development or create a vm to run it (solana-test-validator).
oh. Unfortunately `solana-test-validator` hasn't  support on windows ...
So when I run `solana-test-validator` I get this error
seems you connect to localhost 8899, has there a validator run?
if there is not a validator alive maybe you have to change your connection url
https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com for mainnet
https://api.devnet.solana.com for devnet
<@!788215642070581289>
<@!788215642070581289> you are a great help ... thanks bro
got it
with the help of account i created
and solana does it by itself ?
correct balance? actually when you created a token account, you have transfer some SOL into it for rent.
and you can't use them to transfer SOL because they don't belong to system program
so how to fetch the correct Sol balance of a public key i have
if you have installed solana cli, you can type `solana rent 165`
it will return the rent needed if you created a token account
your token account need a rent to preserve your data on chain
yes ...
oh you mean you expected the SOL balance also equals to 0 ?
what i did ... 1. i created a wallet 2. I tried to fetch some balance it provides me this 2039280 value
Hey Devs, when I run `solana account <address?` in windows cmd, I get this error
has anyone had this issue before and how can I fix it?
but sol balance is not getting correct
i am getting token balance correctly
getBalance is always return SOL balance. if you want to fetch token balance, you will need https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#TokenBalance
this is the problem with serum rpc, not related to rust client lol.
can anyone tell me if i am calling any wrong method
i am not able to understand why this is so .... i am successfully able to get correct token balance but sol balance is something getting wrong from calls of web3
<@!788215642070581289> i tried to fetch balance of the a public address with given method "getBalance" in solana web3.js doc .... but problem is even when i have zero balance or you can say a newly created account it gives value of 2039280
I want them to be included next to each other, that's the problem, I think I'll go with the data way then 😄
i think you can send 1 and check its status until it is been confirming, then you send your second tx. remember to change the commitment when you send the second tx.
Yeah that's the problem. I have 2 txs, each close to the limit, but the second tx depends on the state created by the first tx. If I send them only once, the second one might land first, so I need to send the second tx several times to make sure it lands after the first tx.
TBD you can pack all instruction in to one tx if it don't over the size limit. so idk why you need to send a same tx again. but if you really want to do it, I think you can just refresh its blockhash or change your singer.
a simple `Pubkey` of `spl_token_swap` program, it was working fine 1 or 2 days ago.
what is the body you request in the `get_program_accounts`
Yeah got it thank you
I guess you have deployed before and you do a huge changes in your program.
you can remove the key file which resides in the same folder of your .so. and redeploy again. or you can remain the same program id but use `solana program deploy --program-id your-ori-program-id-here <your-program.so here>`
<@!788215642070581289> and can you help with this too please.
I can do it now by adding an additional `u8` at the end of the data, but I wonder there's any more elegant solution.
you can use wallet. https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter
the wallet will manage key for user, when you need user to sign tx, you just call the api which wallet-adapter provided.
the txhash is the feePayer's signaure, so the concept is to make the transaction a little bit different like you can pack another recent blockhash but I don't think it is a common situation . what is the scenario you want to do?
how can I send 1 transaction twice with different signatures?
pay me enough cash and I can be your dev 😛
I am need developer to develop my project
Hi everyone, I am using https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/, but how do I make sure the account persists across browser refreshes instead of creating a new account everytime? How do I make sure that each wallet only has one account associated with the program?
Ok, that's my bad lol. It returns insufficient funds program error when it doesn't deplete all the lamports and my UI has a rounding error
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4BeQY1mVLE98Eb438aQhdsYXgp2QyaCTEvPhjthBJ4a3dz3nQupbZkW2QhtCTEtGmBobM2iXyN9mv8nGdXbhiEjA this is an example
Stake account balance is 
8.507009227
withdrawal amount
8.507009226
but still, it fails
I looked at the stake program tx and i can see multiple failure that seems to be caused by this
Withdrawal behaviour has changed
There is something very weird going on with the stake program
Hi, what must be causing this? `Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 0: account data too small for instruction
`
I got the answer. basically one would deserialize the Message.from(byteArray) and and use Transaction.populate instead
it thinks the unsigned publickey is the signature because it is null/undefined
I tried using the Transaction.from() but it thinks that the unsigned transaction pubkey is the signature itself
anyone know how to deserialize unsigned transaction in solana-web3.js ?
My rpc call `get_program_accounts` in Rust client suddenly returns this error `Error: RPC response error -32602: Invalid params: invalid type: null, expected a boolean at line 1 column 101`.
Any change I'm not aware of?
I ask because I want to know what kind of C++ libs can be compiled with BPF
Thanks for the reply. Can I do this with any GCC and G++ compilable library
Sweet , thanks
They would need to monitor using an RPC node.  But it doesn't exist yet 🙂
Really "events" in this case are just sugar around the current program logging mechanism
Thank you !  Do current dapps use spin up a service off chain for this ?
There's an active design proposal for this, check out https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/14076 and feel free to comment if you have anything to add
Do Solana programs support events ?
ah well only 43 errors
building, cant wait to look at 99 errors once it gets done haha
will try now
<@!867369388608061470>  thank you I think I was using the wrong JS package.
LOL
🙊
So we just wait on these keys to  get funded then?
```const str = binary_to_base58(secretyKey)``` in base58 should work with this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/base58-js
<@!867369388608061470>  thank you so much
trying to convert secretKey to base58 a text
Can someone direct me to some documentation on setting up events inside programs . I would like a program to watch or be triggered from changes on chain .
does any1 know which version of metaplex is stable for mainnet?
let me find my js code
lol... ```print(base58.b58encode(bytearray(privkey)))``` this is my python code but my base58 code I linked earlier works too
are you trying to convert your secretKey to base58 or a wallet?
fromSecretKey returns :  _keypair: {
    publicKey: Uint8Array(32) [
      107,  69, 227,  54,  21, 173, 229, 147,

      155,  22,   4, 212, 230, 196,  12, 153
    ],
    secretKey: Uint8Array(64) [

  }
Hi <@!756604464411967561>  so this is the wallet I can not use the secretKey to import the wallet. It has to be a private key. What I am trying to do is convert   secretKey: Uint8Array(64) [
      123, 208, 168,  60, 218, 174,   6, 121, 179,   1, 144,
      172,  77, 145, 220,  81, 185, 129,  26,  54, 199, 131,
      222, 113, 183, 198, 175, 234,   0,  12, 228, 200, 107,
       69, 227,  54,  21, 173, 229, 147, 247, 200, 182, 162,
      153,  79, 145, 135,  81,  32, 246, 189,  20, 133,  56,
      202, 155,  22,   4, 212, 230, 196,  12, 153
    ]. to private key
what type does the secretKey accessor return?
I would recommend going through these tutorials https://learn.figment.io/pathways . The firs few modules teach   you allot about how to use the web3 sdk to handle accounts.
NFT and Metadata Resources:
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/886259112105635940/886269376196657172
`fromSecretKey` gives you a `Keypair` object which has a secret key accessor: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Keypair.html#secretKey
<@756604464411967561> so this :   const publicKey = new PublicKey(key.publicKey.toString());  gives me the public key address of the account. But I would like to have also the private key
Not sure what you're asking. But what I posted is not generating a new public key/private key pair if that's what you're suggesting
Hi <@!756604464411967561> that is creating a brand new account. I want to convert the existing secret key to a private key so I can import it from a wallet
What I posted above takes a Uint8Array to a Keypair: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Keypair.html#fromSecretKey
is that not working for you?
how can I convert the secretKey array to private key so I can import to another wallet ?
take a look a metaplex code on the client side, I believe its programmed in typescript/javascript but you could translate that into cli
sorry guys I was not clear with my question.  So I created an account with web3.js SDK. It returns following secretKey: Uint8Array(64) [
      252, 243, 125, 155, 174,  71, 225, 197, 104,  47, 178,

Thanks 🙏
dun think chainlink finished their solana integration yet. Most people are using switchboard or pyth and have heard great things about both
Is chainlink  the go to oracle for Solana programs ?
<@!867369388608061470>  when i do without toString() it throws : error - TypeError: Expected String
const str = binary_to_base58(secretyKey)
why toString() owo
when I try. to decode it says no. base58 text
const decoded = bs58.decode(key.secretKey.toString());
I am using the nodejs library base58
https://www.npmjs.com/package/base58-js
idk, double check the structs you are using in the client and make sure the enums match up again? I am spoiled by anchor and idls so I dont want to think about struct hell again
Try this?
```
function solanaWalletKeypair(filePath) {
    const file = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8'));
    const secretKey = Uint8Array.from(file);
    return anchor.web3.Keypair.fromSecretKey(secretKey);
}
```
None of the libc or the sys c++ library are included in BPF builds by default.  If you want specific libraries linked into your program you will need to add them yourself.  Be aware that programs run in a constrained environment so no os system calls, etc...
But both the contact and frontend pass the same data, don't know why is it failing though!
how can I parse with base58?
that generates a keypair, it doesnt parse the data into a base58 that you can export out
I think you can use https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Keypair.html#fromSecretKey but you'd need to write your own (simple) code for reading the secret key from wherever it's stored in your file system
you are not handling the way you pass in data correctly to your smart contract from your client is what it says
there is no web3 api. You can parse out the private key with base58 and then write your own custom logic to fs.write it somewhere else
thank you <@!867369388608061470>  I was reffering solana web3.js not cli

Oh no, was just saying sorry for spamming your conv with my issue
gotcha thank you!
Has anyone run into infinite loops in react rendering with Next.js and https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter ?
I mean, this is a really odd question. You can create an account that is owned by specific programs by passing in a signer. Every wrapped solana is owned by spl program etc.
<@!443079510053748743> how can i help you. Sorry I dont talk in dms :p
Thank you. That information was helpful to us.
If there is a place more available for this question, please tell me too. I have been finding everywhere.
I edited this a week ago, Solana’s dev still have not approved yet. What should I do please?
any way to do straight from CLI? or does it have to be on JS / Rust via SDK
look up ProgramAccounts in anchor for the easiest way to do this
looks like their automated pipeline is failing. Should be up soon I think
How can I add my project to Solana ecosystem? I had created a PR in ecosystem repo and it also merged but still not able to find my project on solana.com/ecosystem
Hey guys, just wanted to ask, how do we use the Solana CLI to generate an account that is owned by a specified program. Similar to the Escrow tutorial example (linked below), where a state account is created which is owned by the Escrow Program.

I see example implementations from the SDK, but not on the solana CLI directly.

If I use the regular `solana-keygen new` then my understanding is that is a regular account owned by the system program.

You got it! Tucked away in this code comment here. https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/instruction.rs#L197
In `spl_token::instruction::close_account` what does `destination_pubkey` refer to? Is that where tokens are sent if the token account doesn't have a 0 balance? Can't find documentation on this.

```
pub fn close_account(
    token_program_id: &Pubkey, 
    account_pubkey: &Pubkey, 
    destination_pubkey: &Pubkey, 
    owner_pubkey: &Pubkey, 
    signer_pubkeys: &[&Pubkey]
) -> Result<Instruction, ProgramError>

Anyone else getting tons of messages for random NFT projects that launch on Solana?
DMs are a scam
Hi, I want to launch a NFT project on solana and am looking for a developer. If anyone is interested, please PM me. Thanks so much!
What's the `Anchory` way to make a lamports tx, all examples are about tokens. Is there something similar to token::Transfer that I missed from the tutorials/stream/tests and example <:tinfoilhat:809110749141663754>
Please DM
Could you dm?
Thank you a lot. It works well
The account has to be zero-balance to deploy  to it
just only have charged sol and I do nothing
That's not how any of this works, but ok
just I have charged sol coin because gas fee is needed for deploying
Move the SOL balance out. https://explorer.solana.com/address/5H365JREsxWyBZJwAzw24J3bWG9dHLHNfFiLcPDHSxjf?cluster=devnet
Then why is it trying to deploy to the same address?
Or better yet, switch to a local cluster until you get the hang of things
I have already replaced it with new keypair
You need to replace the keypair specified by `--program-id`
Hello, <@!785084693023424542>  Please help me
you can disable extensions in firefox. but if you refresh or lock the wallet. it will at least disconnect the wallet connection.
after executing above command below message is shown
Error: Account 5H365JREsxWyBZJwAzw24J3bWG9dHLHNfFiLcPDHSxjf is not an upgradeable program or already in use
refresh should disconnect
I have execute above command
solana program deploy --program-id dist/program/helloworld-keypair.json  dist/program/helloworld.so  -v
Hello, <@!785084693023424542>
Guess I'll be switching to chrome
That's not a thing on Firefox :,(
just close the extension(s)
Maybe a stupid question and I'm just blind. But I'm working on a minting site and I want to see how it looks if I don't have my wallet (Phantom) connected, but I can't seem to figure out how to disconnect my wallet. Is there a button I'm missing? Or is it just harder then expected?
no, it doesn't work. I have replaced new keypair but still "is not an upgradeable program or already in use" message is shown
did that work? redeploying with new keypair?
I have replaced new keypair
it's name is helloworld-keypair.json
one more please,
I have already changed keypair beside the program .so.
There’s a keypair beside the program .so file that’s used by default.  I forget the deploy argument to override it, —help might help. (On a small screen so can’t do more atm)
wired~ I have generate new  wallet using "solana-keygen new" command
Looks like that program account is already present on devnet so you cant deploy to the same address again
sorry, I have posted it as text
Error: Account 5H365JREsxWyBZJwAzw24J3bWG9dHLHNfFiLcPDHSxjf is not an upgradeable program or already in use
Nobody wants to look at a screenshot.  Try posting text of the error

but below error is displayed
I have built helloworld.so and tried to deploy on dev net
nobody knows above problem?
there are multiple ways potentially, getting objects, clock, and timestamps. storing them. then comparing. I am unsure on the best way. It is something you should be able to start with for testing until you determine the best approach.  the rust examples sysvar should have an example you may be able to use in the solana program library source.
copy the text here instead of screenshot.  surrounding with `    `   did you look that address up in dev and see if it already exists?
does anyone know the answer to this?  I'm trying to get the most recent block hash from inside the program
so I am going to deploy it on dev net
mabe it's reason of apple m1 chip
not able to execute solana-test-validator
`is not an upgradeable program or already in use` tends to mean the program has already been deployed and marked not upgradeable, or the programId it tried to deploy with is already in use.   try deploying with the -v flag to see if verbose output helps with any additional information.  were you able to deploy to a localnet?
how could I deploy it?
and my wallet has one sol for testing on test net
https://explorer.solana.com/address/5H365JREsxWyBZJwAzw24J3bWG9dHLHNfFiLcPDHSxjf?cluster=devnet
just I have compiled helloworld.so
not yet
have you deployed it before? you might be using an existing program Id
Please help me. Please dm me if anyone knows about that. Answering here also okay
Why did it fail?How could I solve this problem?
But not able to deploy it on dev net.
I have compiled helloworld.so successfully.

multisignature authentication where multiple signers have to sign off on it
Quick question about the token program:
```
pub fn set_authority(

    owned_pubkey: &Pubkey, 
    new_authority_pubkey: Option<&Pubkey>, 
    authority_type: AuthorityType,

    signer_pubkeys: &[&Pubkey]
) -> Result<Instruction, ProgramError>
```

What is the purpose of the `signer_pubkeys` here?
i dont see why not?  you should be able to just get the logs and parse them for the program your interested in, or you could get all transactions for the program, and parse the transaction logs that way, among other ways.
has some nIce parsing logic: https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer
Is it possible to get logs only from a specific program on devnet or testnet

FYI testnet websocket port == 443
what's a good source of entropy for an on-chain program? I was thinking of using the most recent block hash because it's only around for 400ms (or so I've read). but i'm not sure which API to use to get it. Am I supposed to be reading the recentblockhashes or slothashes sysvar to get this? and if so , how do their APIs work? I'm not really sure how to use them to get a hash. SlotHashes takes some kind of timecode and I dont know what to put. and I don't understand the recentblockhashes API at all. none of the functions describe seem to return an actual hash
Does somebody know whether there is a C/C++ equivalent of the SPL Token program, please? (In Solana SPL git, there is only a header file.)
good point. will do that.
Btw, don't forget to check the version of testnet and your sdk version. There maybe some missing endpoints at SDK. You can handle such cases by creating your custom rpc requests
Let me know if you have any other problems 🙂
ok thank you. This is very helpful

you don't necessarily write that URL when you create a connection

Do you mean RPC url?
What is the testnet(?) websocket url? I tried the one in the docs but get a timeout error. TIA
Solana is open source but doesn't have a contribution guide. As a suggestion, you should write a contribution guide for such an open source project. i.e. contributors should know that they should start a test validator to test their improvements in local
Does anyone know how to make instructions authorization/owner only?
I understand, I'm looking for the code program of ```FARM1U7g8p6XG18m3P25Rnb1RPVQZt2sC4ax35CyJzyc``` to be able to deserialize the data
Every program can have different ways of decoding the data you are seeing. Freedom of choice in data serialization is a feature. However, this does mean you need to know more information about the code in the program itself to deserialize the data
it's a permissionless blockchain, what is an "official program" 😛
Anyone knows if this is an official program and if there's instructions to decode:
```FARM1U7g8p6XG18m3P25Rnb1RPVQZt2sC4ax35CyJzyc```
first elem in array will always give me the first byte
I guess that I can always do : 
```
data[0] == 3 , given that data = bs58.decode(innerInstructions[0].instructions[0].data);
```
if  instruction_id  == 3 -> decode
<@!445425471027544095> So basically I end up with 3 accounts that need to ultimately sign the transaction. With the instructions as Account A, Account B, Account C.

The first transaction Is a transfer of SOL from A->B which needs to be signed by A. The 2nd-7th instructions (in the second trans), are required to be signed by accounts B and C. However the issue is that the first transaction needs to be signed by the Phantom wallet. I then send that signed 1st transaction to my backend. Build the second transaction and then send both of them from the backend.
I mean, detecting the instruction id
becomes the decoding of the data to get the proper instruction
so I guess that the problem now
I'm basically interested on token transfer for decoding
awesome! glad to help.
<@!383348505491668993> you the man!


it works!
no wait, I was using the wrong instruction
and then
``` let decoded = TRANSFER.decode(data);```
Given that decode outputs buffer I'm just doing:
```let data = bs58.decode(innerInstructions[0].instructions[0].data);```
I guess that I still have something wrong here: 
```
data field: 3H8g6LDDzN3q
bs58 decoded <Buffer 03 15 f7 ac 05 29 00 00 00>
borsh decoded { amount: <BN: 2905acf71503> }
value 45104353449219
```
?
should i wait
trying
hey guys first time

What a dumb
yess silly me
maybe the encoding is wrong 🤔
Ah, I see. You're decoding in base 64. You actually need to construct the buffer by decoding it in base 58. https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs58
which is not present on the tx 🤔
And I get this weird number: 15982364342207152092
And trying to parse as:
I've created this structure:
Yup, that's what I thought but then following this logic on the repo:
Gotcha! So just for example, if I decode that base-58 data to hex, you can easily see that first byte:`3H8g6LDDzN3q` (base58) -> `0315f7ac0529000000` (hex)  ... so we know we're dealing with instruction 3 (Transfer). Using that you can decide which layout to use for decoding.
Is there any good soul that could send me a metaplex nft on devnet ? 🙏
But I'm not sure if I'm using the right instructions
Like these:
Thanks again, I think that you can actually use BORSH because I'm maintaining this code that a coworked did, which basically uses borsh to decode token mint data
No problem! Token program doesn't use Borsh actually, so I would roll with buffer-layout to decode. The buffer-layouts described in the JS client library can be used for decoding purposes (once you determine which kind of instruction you're decoding). Let me know if that helps?
and instruction 220 seems not existant
that makes no sense because that BN translates to a number that is not present on the tx
which outputs: ```DECODED { instruction: 220, amount: <BN: eaddccc3b0e8207f> }```
wow, thanks <@!383348505491668993> I think I'm doing someting wrong because I've tried to decode the data instruction with this:
```
const TRANSFER_OR_APPROVE_INSTRUCTION = borsh.struct([
  borsh.u8('instruction'),
  borsh.u64('amount')
]);
```
Most of the code in that client library is used for creating token instructions. You can manually decode the base-58 data field, and look at the first byte (it's an unsigned 8-bit integer) to determine which instruction is used. You can see the complete list of instructions here: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/instruction.rs#L415
what's the common way to get chain data from the solana chain ? I would like to get information about swaps on the chain
Let me give you a bit more detail
The only limitation should be the overall size of the transaction: 1232 bytes max
I was unsuccessful in the past, kept getting unable to verify signatures errors
is there a way to combine those 7 instructions into one instruction and get the proper signatures?
Makes sense
No, not possible.  Only instructions within a transaction execute atomically
Is there a way to combine these together?
I am building a minter where the first transaction (1 instruction) signed by the user, is accepting payment and the second transaction (6 instructions) signed by me, is minting the token.
Is there a way to ensure that two transactions execute atomically?
```
  ): TransactionInstruction {
    const dataLayout = BufferLayout.struct([
      BufferLayout.u8('instruction'),
      Layout.uint64('amount'),
      BufferLayout.u8('decimals'),
    ]);
```
Seems to be this one to decode token "data" instructions, right?
Thank you!!!!
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getSignaturesForAddress
Hey guys. This might be a stupid question but is there any way to get all the transaction for a specific account/address? TIA
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js
Does anybody has something like this to be able to decode the token program TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA transactions?
<@!828385808260005940> - iirc, a u64 will overflow around 18 billion SOL.  But beyond that, yes you do have a fair point.
if not then why not mint a 100billlion or some extreme number and leave it there?
does it cost anything to mint the devnet sol?
hey i had a question
I guess that for me to be able to decode the "data" on both instructions needs the BORSH for the FARM and Token program respectively, right?
Right. This maps it out visually: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4YndZxuJHnRSW4UXPkx5fU3MXRy9MwUaydTPTXfV5Z48FXLbxLwkGuwK7Dv8TW6UHGsjN3ETos95pRUrUMYMoUXV
which makes sense because accountKeys 8 is FARM and 5 is Token
Basically, the programIndex 8 on data does "something"  with the FARM program and the innerInstruction seems to be sending x amount of tokens using the token program functions
Not a bother! Explorer should prove helpful with this.
Sorry to bother, but I'm trying to create a parser to better represent transactions actions
ah ok so it reads: this innerInstruction with index 0 and data " ..... " it is being executed by the account which has array index 5 on transaction.message.accountKeys
which appears to be the token program in this case
It corresponds to accountKeys
does not say in the doc
that also corresponds to accountKeys or that is for the "accounts" array on instructions 🤔
I understand but what confues me is that it says programIndex 5 and you  have "data" on innerInstructions
correct!
```
                "instructions": [
                    {
                        "accounts": [
                            0,
                            1,
                            2,
                            3,
                            4,
                            5,
                            6,
                            7
                        ],
                        "data": "HraafStZCduqcGpHQrEMQ3",
                        "programIdIndex": 8
                    }
                ],
```
points to the 0 index on instructions array:
so you mean that the index 0 here: 
```
            "innerInstructions": [
                {
                    "index": 0,
                    "instructions": [
                        {
                            "accounts": [
                                4,
                                3,
                                0
                            ],
                            "data": "3H8g6LDDzN3q",
                            "programIdIndex": 5
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ],
```
Maybe this will help: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#transaction-structure. The inner instruction index points to the specific instruction that falls under the message.instructions array. From there you can determine the programIdIndex, which points to the index in message.accountKeys.
Are there instructions somewhere on how to create a bootstrap validator?
Why after running "solana-test-validator -r" i cannot access my localnet using the given adress plz ?
(programatically)
ok I understand thanks, now how do you know what program that instruction comes from?
The unknown instruction comes from this program, maybe you'll find an answer there https://explorer.solana.com/address/FARM1U7g8p6XG18m3P25Rnb1RPVQZt2sC4ax35CyJzyc
that is the tx, but I need to be able to decode it programatically
```https://solscan.io/tx/4YndZxuJHnRSW4UXPkx5fU3MXRy9MwUaydTPTXfV5Z48FXLbxLwkGuwK7Dv8TW6UHGsjN3ETos95pRUrUMYMoUXV```
But programIndex 5 means the instruction in the program, how do I know the program itself that is being executed? 🤔
Also try this tool https://explorer.solana.com/tx/inspector
Could you provide an explorer link to the tx? that should be able to tell you a lot 🙂
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/instruction.rs#L140
The program id index is the specific instruction in the program, this is instruction number 5
because If understand correctly, programAccountIndex correspond with accountKeys array:
```

Ok thanks
I'll check it out in a bit
i am attempting to deploy a project on solana, but the problem is i split it up into 2 separate projects, the second 1 is really tiny but was wondering if there's an easy way to merge 2 projects, or use my main project to call components from my second project
Hmm, okay. Please open an issue on the repo!
Doesnt work
I tried wrapping it like ```<WalletMultiButton> 
Connect 
</WalletMultiButton>```
<WalletMultiButton>Your Text Here</WalletMultiButton> should work
I am using WalletMultiButton

Oooh right, I deploy the debug versión not the release. Do you think it will might be cheaper?
Im also not really optimising the program size at this stage
Not sure how much it costs do deploy on main net
morning guys, I have all the SPL token accounts info of a NFT collection from calling getTokenAccountsByOwner... then I want to get metadata of each token(NFT), how can I do that? I saw it needs PDA, how can I get the PDA info? Thanks!
I thought that contract were way more cheap than that. I mean , that’s a lot of money!
A bit over 1 sol on testnet, why?
I working in a similar example how much SOL did the contract consumed to be deployed in the devnet?
Hi. If I getTransaction from RPC with 3 levels of crossprogram calls may I see 3-rd inner instructions (inner of inner)?
Hello, I am working on a escrow program where two wallets can swap a variable amount of different SLP tokens. I am wondering, do I have to reference all accounts (all pda token accounts, all receiving accounts) in the instruction, or is there a "cleaner" way. Referencing 40+ accounts on an ix doesn't feel right. Ty in advance ❤️
<@!792782891196874792> change bpf-tools to v1.15 works
this one I'm not familiar with. however, now you have more recent toolchain, which you probably can use with the solana 1.7.12. so try setting the active_release symbolic link again to 1.7.12 release `ln -s ~/.local/share/solana/install/releases/1.7.12/solana-release ~/.local/share/solana/install/active_release`  and in `~/.local/share/solana/install/releases/1.7.12/solana-release/bin/sdk/bpf/dependencies/` set the link `bpf-tools` to point to `~/.cache/solana/v1.15/bpf-tools`
root@pokabets001:~/.local/share/solana/install/releases# ls
1.6.6  1.7.11  1.7.12  1.7.3
root@pokabets001:~/.cache/solana# ls
v1.15  v1.5  v1.8  v1.9  v2.3.3
Would help to see a few lines of code where you are declaring the components, but assuming it's a button, whatever you pass as children to the button should be displayed instead of the default text

yeah should be enough
what website were you using when this happened?
But it was a simple example to do token swap. Isn’t that too much? In real world is like $us100 for a single contract?!
Thanks. I'll soon be through with The Rust Programming Language book, I'm wondering if t'will be enough
yess i finally created an entire nft collection on the dev net. solana documetnation is so good it took me only like 5 hours to do it
Thanks so much 🙏 someone can help
its normal, depending on how big is your code.
Hey can you ask the devs how my tokens got transferred out of my wallet and into a token loader program associated account? I never sent them I just got them.  No one has been able to answer this question. 
My wallet address

more is usually better but a basic understanding is enough to get started learning solana
So, I've been learning Rust for quite some time now. How much of Rust do I really need to know, before I learn Solana?
Hi again. I deployed a program in devnet and it consumed 0.79 Sol . Isn’t that too much?
its building from source ... Will let you know if it works
i see that 1.7.12 solana installs v1.9 toolchain. that version doesn't have the math functions such as `powf` in the compiler builtins library, unfortunately. so for now the only option is to build solana from the source. version 1.8.0 will have the updated toolchain libraries.
let me try. Thanks alot for your support <@!792782891196874792>
the script will build and install it. then you can relink `~/.local/share/solana/install/active_release` to point to `~/.local/share/solana/install/releases/1.8.0/solana-release`
I dont have 1.8.0
~/.local/share/solana/install/releases# ls
1.6.6  1.7.11  1.7.12  1.7.3
however if you want to build from source, in your clone of solana repository simply run `./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh ~/.local/share/solana/install/releases/1.8.0/solana-release`
the fix was added in v1.15. let me check what solana 1.7.12 has.
Hello, I'm trying to upload an nft using metaplex to devnet. But I keep facing this error. A few other people have this error as well. Any clue?
~/.cache/solana# ls
v1.5  v1.8  v1.9  v2.3.3
In your ~/.cache/solana/ directory which versions do you have?
and replace solana bin ?

Hi guys, i am going to build a nft game, allow user to mint nft. But user’s wallet has other nfts too, how can i get which nft belong to my game? Thanks.
Im using solana client to install solana in my computer. How to I manually compile with your latest update?
no you didn't do anything wrong, sorry. We were missing the math functions in our compiler_builtins library and  I see that I fixed that only 19 days ago https://github.com/dmakarov/compiler-builtins/commit/19e37467152bc2cdf8531b672b059a34a2caab58 . so it's probably not included in the toolchain that is shipped with solana 1.7.12 version. If you can build solana off the snapshot of solana master branch on github, that would bring the most recent version of the toolchain that contains the fix.
what should I do? did I miss any settings?
i see that powf is undefined in your .so file.
<@!792782891196874792> check my transaction info here:

hey guys, i have 2 projects that I want to merge, how would I go about merging them (react) without redoing the whole button / functionality etc again
hi people. how can I mint NFT directly from SOL blockchain , bypassing the website for mint? On ETH you can mint from contract. Is something similar possible on SOL?
it needs setup before you can run the funtion

f32. same code as you posted in your original message about the error
did you try f32 or f64?
can you maybe attach your compiled .so file that you deploy?
Great!
you mean the js version?
solana cluster-version
1.7.12
perfect it worked well! I was using 1.7.8 before btw. 1.7.12 definitely solves the issue, thanks!
what version of solana do you have installed?
Awesome. Thanks a lot!!
Im using Devnet. solana --version
solana-cli 1.7.11 (src:bdb77b0c; feat:1140394761)
just check
devnet is back
yup devnet rpc nodes are back up, thanks for your patience
It working again guys <@!511018485342666752> <@456226577798135808> <@!455356864767590411>
only rpc nodes are affected
it's still producing blocks
Keep checking solscan transaction page till it starts producing blocks
What issues are you seeing on testnet?
How can I get all the token information owned by an account from TypeScript?

like this//
$ spl-token accounts

AQoKYV7tYpTrFZN6P5oUufbQKAUr9mNYGe1TTJC9wajM  1    (Aux-2*)
So both devnet and testnet are not working right?
Okay thank you!
devnet not up yet
Hey guys may I check whether testnet is up?
Should be about an hour or so for the rpc nodes to catch up
How long can we expect to back up again
The cluster is fine, just the rpc nodes are having issues
yeah sadly :(
damn devnet still down?
btw why is <@!235148962103951360> apart of core contributors haha 😆
kk thanks for the help
asap, you can use a local validator or use testnet for now
okay thanks  and there were no ETA when it will get back to normal?
see above, the devnet api nodes are unhealthy and are being updated
Why can't i airdrop my self i am on devnet? "Error: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds"
if you're still seeing issues on that version, please let us know
Okay 👌
try updating to v1.7.12, we just fixed something there
1.7.0
which version of the solana cli are you using?
Is it normal for mainnet program deployments to take a long time and just fail?

does that override the current install ?
yes, there is also a github issue for tools on M1. It's an issue that has been discussed
please use https://api.devnet.solana.com but thanks for letting us know
this ?
https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools#build-from-source
really, can you link me how
I had to build the tools from source for M1
```Illegal instruction: 4

I really wish solana-test-validator works on mac m1
okay now it seems to work lol!
oh really?
even testnet not working
okay thanks

thanks
<:pepeOK:789856610678865941>
ahh got it
yeah that was a different issue
but i'll just wait then
.
oh because i saw someone before had my same problem on airdrop
should be fixed soon
it hasn't been a few days, it's been a few hours
yeah, i saw it's a few days that it's not working, any eta for the fix?
perfect
on devnet? see my other messages
spl token accounts need to be rent exempt, so they won't be rent collected. Other types of accounts which aren't rent exempt would eventually go to zero and be deleted
how can I change nft name and image???
keep getting "Error: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds" on airdrop command <:vsad:813200097093091328>
Okay. thanks clear, thanks. But what will happen after account is no longer funded? I mean, what will happened with SPL tokens?
no
Do solana admins ever DM you before you contact them?
you can use testnet or a local validator (solana-test-validator) for now
the rpc nodes for devnet need to be updated
How do you solve `node is behind by _ slots` on devnet whenever I try to send a transaction
we're on it, the devnet rpc nodes need to be updated. For now you can use testnet
how much does it cost in fees to create 5000 nft on solana?
Same issue here
yeah this is fine, and it works
I got a quick question - if I need an account only for the runtime of a transaction, is it fine to fund it with 0 lamports so it gets cleaned up right afterwards? 
Would this work or do accounts need some lamports to be able to do anything
an account will be created with the pubkey you specify. Rent exempt means rent exempt even after two years ( for as long as the account is funded ).
how can I name my token?
Thank you! Was wondering why it stops working 😓

thank you
devnet down just go to testnet
Same issue
Getting this on devnet: `Translating error SendTransactionError: failed to send transaction: Node is behind by 15756 slots` --> is there a way to fix?
What program are you calling from typescript and what order does the program you are calling expect?
So the order that the accounts are identified is the order of the `&[AccountInfo]` within the program. If the program expects the `from_wallet` to be first it will be at index 0
guys i am trying to create an nft collection and allow people to mint on my website, can anyone give me a brief of what should I do, and what tools/programs I would need, thanks in advance 🌹
Yes, I am using typescript
Do you mean inside of a program (Rust)?
I have two question regarding spl tokens:
 - what will happen if I send spl token to an unfunded account (spl-token --allow-unfunded-recipient)
 - what will happen with spl token after two year, when rent exempt is over?
yes works perfectly thanks
ahhh ok thank you!
You should fund the account first. "account" only displays funded (existing) pubkeys.
AccountNotFound
hey when i run the command solana account 'pubkey' it returns this error, can someone shed somelight on this please?

i am looking on how to add metadata to nft like images etc...
no its missing many things
how long is solana devnet usually down for? haha was finally picking up momentum and was gonna be finished soon. Solana documentation is top notch.
ty for the info I also had issues with airdrop 🙂
Hi everyone! I’m a fellow developer, I started a smart contract / program exemplar. I deployed to the dev net and it consumed 0.79 sol . Isn’t that too much for a single program?
oh devnet is down??!! maybe thats why!
I made a file system wallet using cmd line

now I am trying to airdrop some tokens, its saying "Dynamic program error: No default signer found, run "solana-keygen new -o solwallet/my-keypair.json" to create a new one"

It seems like its not detecting my wallet
Yep
wait devnet down for a while?
i ran metaplex upload and it says this - Translating error SendTransactionError: failed to send transaction: Node is behind by 6138 slots. followed by a bunch more errors how do i fix?
thanks! 👍
kinda
is the devnet down?
I tried VPN to few different locations (so as to pick up different devnet rpc I guess) and getting the same issue. On my private devnet RPC also same issue. Thinking it's affecting entire devnet rpc network.
more or less. lets see if this comes out right. the token account when initialized, get a token owner, which is the public key of the 'owner' address. in this case the wallet address your referring to. this also allows calling `getTokenAccountsByOwner` and it can lookup all the tokens associated with that 'owner' address. this allows the association of 1 public/wallet address to multiple tokens. All 'accounts' are owned by a program. The token account has the additional concept of owner for the address/public key/wallet address of the token account 'holder'. The underlying token account that is created, is owned by the SPL-Token program.

add info:
the 'keypair' is the public & private keypair. nobody gets the private key accept for the owner and owner chooses to use or share this as sees fit. the public key is associated with the private key. signing is done with a signature which may use a keypair public/private key to sign things like transactions or message. Wallets help do this for you, with your authorization, and try to add protection layers (seeds, phrases, passwords) to protect your keys, based on the type of wallet.

'Associated token accounts are a way to help make it easier to link token accounts of similar mints with different or same programs, to make it easier to refer and find token accounts, aggregate and hopefully prevent unnecessary duplication.
Do you know how to generate private key from mnemonic and make the private same as Phantom using Python? My generated private key is different
```
def bip39(mnemonic_words):
    seed = Bip39SeedGenerator(mnemonic_words).Generate()
    bip32 = BIP32.from_seed(seed)
    secret_key = bip32.get_xpriv_from_path(f"m/501'/0'/0/0")
    p = public.PrivateKey.from_seed(secret_key)
    a = Account(p._private_key)
```
Anyone else figure out the devnet issue?
How do you update a solana program that has already been deployed. I get this error `Error: Buffer account is already executable`
having same issue.
above is for devnet, I believe.

Thanks! 🙂
generally, the NFT would be 0 decimal places.  but you can getAccountInfo of an address, and use this to get the data your looking for.
Yes. I realized I made a mistake. Thanks!

Is there a way to get the decimals of nft tokens from JavaScript?
so if I understand correctly, a token account has a special kind of ownership (and this ownership is NOT by a program, but actually a keypair (e.g. a wallet) ... and the whole purpose of this is so a single owner (e.g. with one wallet) can contain multiple token accounts and easily transfer the tokens with the use of a single private key .... hence the purpose of the token account ownership being tied to a wallet is for convenience ... is this correct?

i am using this in devenet

how do i do that
can you paste the log messages?
ok, so i guess loaders represent the 'heavy lifting' on the runtime so to speak, and additional loaders in the future will obviously mean extended functionality / capabilities that the blockchain is able to do ... ok interesting 👍
anyone here to help me
Yeah, there’s also a distinction between programs and loaders in the runtime.  Loaders being programs that can load other programs.  Currently the bpf loader is the only one, in the past we had a move loader when we were hacking around with facebooks’s blockchain r&d project.  Maybe we’ll have a wasm loader in the future
thanks a lot, so differing entrypoints can go to numerous destinations (e.g. native programs) within the runtime then ... ok cheers
This is managed by the runtime,which is built into the validator. There’s a small set of native, non-BPF programs, that serve as the initial entrypoints: system, vote, stake, bpfloader programs notably
ahh right. Is there an example of how to do this?
so I understand the BPF loader executes the program (e.g. smart contract) during the processing of a transaction, however I was wondering what is the first program (on the blockchain) that actually receives the transaction request (e.g. asynchronously via web3.js) and actually reads the initial entrypoint with the program_id, accounts, _instruction_data parameters (like what is the program that passes the call to the BPF loader)) ??
i am getting this error anyone please help

Transfer: from must not carry data

It seems to make sense to have a PDA to carry both data and act as a wallet
Hello guys! 
I am looking for some DeFi primitives in Sol. Are there any you recommend and/or know to have the most TVL within it's group?
- Lending & Borrowing (aave/compound)
- Staking (Lido)
- Vaults (Yearn)
- AMMs (sushi/uni)
Hi! Any developer here is interested in working on a NFT project? Thanks
you just call Transfer() with from/to, and sign with the sender
If I wanted to transfer SOL from a PDA program account carrying state to another account, how would I do this?

The logs I'm seeing with the error is:

```
    'Program 11111111111111111111111111111111 invoke [2]',

has anyone tried using web3 with a ledger wallet?
😄
Or make PR on https://github.com/rooware-io/solstake to add such feature
but i never connected a ledger to it
i used it before for writing my own solana program
ok ill give it a go
might as well try the cli like <@!831450660146642974> is suggesting
hmm I think you can change the withdraw authority on delegated stake too
so i can move to new wallet
so waiting for epoch to end
cause i am currently waiting to unstake in phantom
but i think only the cli tool exposes that
you can
you can split off some stake and set the authority to someone else
like transfer the ownership of staking to another address
i wish there was a way to transfer my staked SOL (dont say marinade or socean)
yeah it's the ole check if you have viruses thing
"Now you are for sure"
"click here to see if you got scammed"

well not 100% safu, but definitely you arent exploited in this instance
yes
so im 100% SAFU?
yeah they are working on improving the safety apparently
its too easy to send funds on it
hopefully they get good soon for everyones sake
i dont think phantom is creating a really safe experience atm
yeah it's a big responsibility to create a good wallet
😛
phantom has a lot of work to do i think
i feel so ashamed
yea can we report this guy, i have been in crypto 6 years, i work as a dev in crypto, how the hell did i fall for this today...
but it might be worth pinging ftx/binance about this person too
idk if there is a way to report scam wallets to binance or w/e
i moved my savings to another wallet
yea
So starting from the Mer LP tokens transfer, that is all you?
he couldve stolen everything so u should thank the lucky gods he didnt lol
luckily it's a pretty naive scammer
yeah you can see the "to address" has a history of random people sending sol to it
but you dont have that here so its fine
i think im fine?
one instruction
its just this

yea but in my case
you will see a bunch of unknown instructions and one of those could be cleaning out your wallet

transfer
yea theres only 1 instruction
SAFU
yep, nothing else than a transfer
i did it through the website though
i think your fine
this is just a manual transfer
i sent 1.51 SOL
raydium.me
the scam website was
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/51D7KvRQp2pXzvhyvaAaFuZsGfrPuzAEwiNWQnqQgginKXCp6GjSvqpguXLukYwxhLcDqTcoDY2jesGsdQcNiph8
please do, a scam study is good
i have it open on solana explorer
feel free
can i link the tx?
ah ok, well if you are burning this wallet it should be fine
yes, but what we mean is that it could have additional side effects for the future
i moved all my other tokens to a new wallet
but didnt take anything else, and my staked sol still remains
the transaction took all my sol
i did approve a transaction
connecting your phantom wallet isnt enough, you need to approve a transaction
They could be approving delegation for future token balance to be sucked out
and connected my phantom wallet
to ensure it didn't have any other side effects
i went on a scam website
but <@!831450660146642974> does raise a good point, you should take a look at what tx that actually did
no
it didnt wipe the rest of my tokens in my wallet, just took the 1 sol i sent by signing a transaction
So you went to phantom and sent 1 SOL manually to some address?
the rest of my sol is staked
but it was only 1 sol
interesting
yea
so you self rugged
yeah, my response was specific to their situation
i sent it myself
but did you send it yourself or approved it?
not sure why they would say it, but if you do sign an unsafe transaction with your wallet everything could be wiped out.
yea transaction
What do you mean by sent 1 SOL by mistake, transaction?
Not really, what if the transaction signs sending all tokens out
candy machine is good if you just want to get everything working out of the box, but I personally find it not very easy to understand what's actually going on
awesome 😄
here's a tutorial you can play with if you're interested: https://hackmd.io/@levicook/HJcDneEWF
well if you put it that way
you dont want any of my sweet smelly durian flesh?
it's all good, happy to help, don't need anything in return 🙂
hmm I think there was some simple webapp to do it that someone made, but can't find it
ill send you one soon
how do i make an NFT on solana?
haha yes 😄
haha can it be durian themed?
for saving my sanity
<@!466984915376799748> i will send you a lovely NFT thanking you one day
ha idk why they would say that
yup, that's right
the raydium mod was saying its still possible...
yea i was using ledger through phantom, i was fairly sure the private key couldnt have been compromised unless i literally typed it out
good on you for using a hardware wallet!
not yet 😉
ok so i dont need to cry that my life is ruined then
but yeah if you're using a ledger, you should be good
yea i didnt do that, i just went on a fake version of raydium by mistake and sent them 1 sol by mistake
yeah well the common attack is when an attacker convinces you to type your seed phrase in a place where you shouldn't
thats my understanding at least
cause the key remains on my ledger (hardware wallet) otherwise right
the only way to give the private key is literally send it to someone
so there is no single possible application that i can sign a solana transaction on or approve that can take my key right?
but still probably a good idea to rotate keys
best way to know if they have your private key is if all your funds are gone
yeah based on what you said, I see no reason to believe they have your private key
I always thought the private key remains on my wallet and they just now know my public key / got some free money but dont have my private key
question for any other dev here, i sent some sol to a scam wallet by mistake, i approved my connection and sent the transaction the scam website, but i never typed out my private key to them, the people on the raydium discord are claiming its possible they took my private key, i dont see how this is possible, can any other developer clarify this?
you can also mint directly into the users account of course
that's what I do. I mint into a PDA, then add metadata, disable minting, and then send from the PDA into the users account
I’m taking out 3.00019 not 3.0019. It should work to me. Also where did u see that there is only 2.9995 delegated?
okay, that makes sense
it depends. I would review how metaplex does its implementation. But more or less, thats the idea in the simple sense. if your creating multiple NFTs, that are all 1 time creations. you can create a mint. create a token account. mint a token to that token account. done.
since a mint can only mint one type of token
and if I want to mint multiple NFTs. I assume that I just create a new mint account for each one?
I think so too!  keep at it
my code is largely doing what you're describing. so this explains a lot and I think I can straighten it out from here
I accidentally just minted the NFT into a PDA ... lol
okay that makes sense. so for an account to be a token account for the user, what you're saying is like an address derived from both the program ID and the user's key
for spl-token, there is the mint account -> it can mint, has an authority, decimal, mint info, it has No Balance, it cannot hold tokens.  The 'token account', this is what can hold a balance of tokens. You specify the mint when creating the token account. Both want a create account instruction followed by the relevant initialize instruction initialize a mint, or initialize account.    when you close an account here, you would only close a token account, and transfer its lamports out, because it has the balance. If your somehow or for some reason minting to a temp token account, you could close that, but otherwise, you could just mint and or create a token account for the user and mint the token (NFT) right to their account. and you dont need to close anything in that case.
right, we went over that
that makes sense
so you just freeze it or otherwise set up the contract to not mint any more of the token?
I see
Unlike a token account, there is no way to close a mint account.
i'll try setting the close authority to something else
is it trying to write to the token program?
but it just keeps saying it escalates the writable pirveledge
I set the authority to the token program
but then, how do you close the mint account when you're done?
is this the ongoing same issue ?  with using a PDA to close an account?  you/your program needs to have the authority on whatever account your trying to close. whenever you create an account, you need to make sure you/program have the authority if thats the intention.  only the authority can mint, in the mint account case.
Thanks
nope, can't be modified
What does your client code look like? Are you not passing readFileSync the path to your IDL?
Can a transaction be modified in any way after being signed? In example can a instruction be added to the transaction or the data of one of the instructions be modified? I am guessing not but wanted to double check
do I have to call set_authority to give myself the authority to close the account? or is there some way to establish this earlier?
in this case the owner of the account is the token program itself, and I want it to deposit its SOL into the taker account
i'm not totally sure how to construct a valid close_account instruction, I keep getting a priveledge escalation in the token program
can anyone provide any insight to this? I have never used js or ts
```rs
    msg!("deleting account");
    
    invoke_signed(
        &spl_token::instruction::close_account(
            &spl_token::id(),
            mint_account.key,
            taker_account.key,
            &spl_token::id(),
            &[&spl_token::id()]
        ).unwrap(),
        &[ mint_account.clone(), taker_account.clone(),  token_program_info.clone(), token_program_info.clone() ],
        &[&[mint_seed as &[u8]]]
    );
```
It seems like it has something to do with my node installation
and I keep getting this error:
Hi I am currently working on this anchor tutorial: https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/tutorials/tutorial-0.html
hi guys, I am a blockchain security researcher and new to Solana. I was wondering whether solana provides the archive node and the client for reexecuting the transactions. Meanwhile, does Solana provides the open access to explore the internal actions for any transactions? Many thanks
okay trying out this one!
i believe you can send multiple signers in the send transaction options..
it looks like the base adapter allows it, with sendTransaction -> SendTransactionOptions and partialSign
nice, does that one support multiple signers?
do you mean with https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter ? the newer one?   sol-wallet-adapter is the older project serum one.
when you send transactions with the new adapter, after you do something like:
const { publicKey, sendTransaction } = useWallet() and you have the key, and when you send the transaction the wallet adapter implementation should take care of a signer.
Hmm right, I'm not sure because I haven't used the wallet adapter
and then I can regenerate the second PDA and check it
in a way that they're both off the curve
so I guess I need a way of deriving the second PDA from the first one
since, if I mint the NFT into another PDA
the only issue is figuring out if the PDA was used before to mint an NFT
so I could just handle that from there
oh but the same program has to do this
but wont initalize_mint allow me to set a new authority?
but not sure how to do it with `sol-wallet-adapter`
without going through sol-wallet-adapter, I'd just do `connection.sendTransaction(tx, [newAccount, remaining sig accounts])`
if the mint authority is gone/frozen and or closed, and or 0'd out. no one could do anything, really, with that mint authority, or not much.
oh , but what would happen if I tried to open a new account with the same PDA? wouldn't this allow me to mint new tokens?
got it. I'm actually trying to do sol wrapping by: 1) create new & properly sized account using SystemProgram and 2) initialize it to a token account for the native mint. However step 1 requires the new account's own signature, and I'm not sure how to use sol-wallet-adapter to do that. any pointer here?
okay thanks, that's really helpful
yes if its just a 1 time ever mint i think you can close the account and do a regular system transfer ; debit / credit lamports to the appropriate accounts, assuming you have authority, and that should be that. its an interesting question what happens if you can close a mint account and what happens to the data/refs, as well the refs for token accounts created from that mint acct. if possible.
+ also, metaplex should have a related example of this I would think
Yes exactly, with some extra handling around the rent exempt balance
That sounds much nicer than hand writing JSON!
anchor-go has this to some extent. I think we can probably do this generally with pluggable serialization interface.
How does sol wrapping work? Does an account's lamports become its balance when it is initialized using `Token.createInitAccountInstruction` to a token account for the native mint?
As in, why go through 11 instructions when you could just do 2?
This is kind of a weird question but… I’m sort of having to deal with the escrow programs of DE/Solanart and now Magic Eden.

The first two move a token by creating a new token account with the new owner and moving it to that from another token account they created for the seller (which they close).

ME seems to “just” call SetAuthority on the “shared” token account to assign a new owner.

Is there an actual difference in the “endpoint” state between the two?
hey guys, still with the hello world program. In the final step now and I am getting this error. I am new to rust too and it doesn't help. Any help?
or should I just transfer the sol using the system program
I also want to call `close_account` after to claim the SOL that would be transferred as payment for the NFT. does closing the mint account mess anything up?
thanks a lot for the info
that also works
you might just be able to do something with `FreezeAccount` and `AuthorityType` in spl-token, 
and use an `invoke_signed` and `set_authority` with `AuthorityType::FreezeAccount`as a type param.

can check the spl and metaplex source, should have refs.
that makes more sense now
right
if no one is authorized, no more minting
it just removes the mint authority. I see
hm oh wait
so i'm wondering if  "mint --disable" just freezes the account or if it freezes and then closes the account
I've read that but im trying to map that process to IPCs that I call from within my program
yes check this out: as an example. 
https://spl.solana.com/token#example-create-a-non-fungible-token
is disabling mints a property of the mint account? or just something you enforce inside your program  (assuming the mint is a PDA) ? do I have to call something like "freeze_account" in spl_token to properly disable it?
its really just depends on what you want to do. The basic idea of the NFT is a supply of 1 and mint disabled. Anyone can create a token account for that mint, but if only 1 was minted, there is only 1. Meta data can be used along with different approaches to have the concept of a master edition where you mint limited or other editions, of your NFT. I would read some through the following resources to get a hold on what you want to do and possible approaches you want to take.  Editions, licenses, rights, royalties, etc.

NFT and Metadata resources: (the metaplex dev guide is a good resource to learn about these things and different approaches)
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/886259112105635940/886269376196657172
assuming this is all in spl_token
and then to disable minting do you just freeze the mint and delete it?
rather than the payers account directly holding the NFT
https://github.com/hashblock/solana-cli-program-template
I just realized that you can only transfer tokens between accounts with the same mint. so I'm guessing that's how it works
when minting an NFT for some account, do you mint the token into an account that buys the NFT? or do you mint it into a separate account that the account that bought the NFT then owns?
what are you trying to do?  most of the tests in the core and SPL are in rust, and lots of instances using banks client.
try this: https://discord.gg/metaplex
hi this link I cant get access to. what role do I need?
Could you point to a good example of a Rust client for solana?
1. does this compile? is it a run time or compile time error you see.
2. how/where are you calling this getBalance function? 
3. what is _connect? the error you show does not correlate to the code your showing specifically? 
    ..how are you calling this broken async function in the first place?
4. call it correctly: let balance = await connection.getBalance(account.publicKey);
5. for what its worth. missing semicolon  };
6. does a browser come up and you can look at what your objects are, to see missing pieces or object.
7. its pretty clear something with _connect object is not correct. why?
I am stuck on this for a long
yeah starry, I tried your suggestion, didn't work
if I were you I would try
Thanks starry, 
but I don't believe that's the problem here.
I think I might be missing something
you have to wrap in a try catch
if you use `await` you can't use `.catch`
Hi guys, 
I am stuck at something niche.
I am trying to call the Connection class and then some of its methods from solanaWeb3.js in a reactNative project.
I am unsuccessful in calling the class with errors, like:
TypeError: (0, _connect.getBalance) is not a function. 

my file: connect.js
```import {Connection, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL, PublicKey} from '@solana/web3.js';

const createConnection = () => {
  return new Connection('https://api.testnet.solana.com', 'confirmed');
};

export default async function getBalance(publicKey) {
  const connection = createConnection();
  const _publicKey = publicKeyFromString(publicKey);

  const lamports = await connection.getBalance(_publicKey).catch(err => {
    console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
  });

  const sol = lamports / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL;
  return sol;
}

const publicKeyFromString = publicKeyString => {
  const pubkey = new PublicKey(publicKeyString);
  console.log('pubkey:', pubkey);
  return pubkey;
};```
All check it out -- thank you!
Recommend using this form of solana-go. A lot more complete and maintained https://github.com/gagliardetto/solana-go
thank you
tried to get rid of them all, so no
`solana-keygen recover -h`
https://github.com/gagliardetto/anchor-go/blob/main/idl/solana/spl/token.json#L1011 -- this is it, yeah. awesome. thanks!
hello, how can i recover my keypair from my seedphase  via command line or code ?
actually it looks like the token program already has a handwritten idl here: https://github.com/gagliardetto/anchor-go/blob/main/idl/solana/spl/token.json
once we have anchor idl's for everything, you could use something like this: https://github.com/gagliardetto/anchor-go
account-decoder
that'll do it
cool
yeah that exists in the solana monorepo
presumably for the parsedJson repr from the rpc endpoints, someone has written the code to parsed most of these representations? do you know where that stuff is off the top of your head? 🙂
that gif is a little annoying... removed.
thanks
will use the library then
i was using solana-go-sdk, which while more complete than solana-go, didn't have the token account data structure stuff in there, so i had to go to solana-go and find it there (https://github.com/streamingfast/solana-go/blob/master/programs/token/types.go#L21), but then it used a custom binary packer/unpacker, etc etc
not possible
with cli
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/804968834497904640.png?v=1
guys how to derive passphrase from keypair
<@!501570363566587905> is that something that already exists?
yeah I think what we should do is hand write the anchor idl files for spl programs and then you can use anchor client libraries to interact with them
I see
i'm working in golang ... the api's are incomplete at best
just making sure i'm not missing anything, lol.
yup, makes sense
everything would break if it changed
yea
right, and that's guaranteed to remain stable for stuff like token?
you can determine it by counting which index in the enum the ix you care about is at
rust enums use integer discriminators
Also when parsing instructions, CloseAccount is encoded as a single byte 'A', but it's literally just the rust enum?
Thanks for clearing that up. So any other way that you know of that allow me to create a new pubkey on-chain? Or is it best practice that these are always created client side? Even when they are only needed one time and can be thrown away after that?
Like, I'm trying to find the owner of a token account, which is stored in arbitrary structure in the account's data field. I managed to find the structure and padding by searching around github, but the issue with the the "official" sources is that sometimes its just a rust enum or something encoded as whatever the native binary representation is
yeah so that one is in github here: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library
Okay, so for spl-token, for example?
no, most likely what will happen is that programs publish an idl with something like anchor
Is there a library or index or something of the structure of `data` fields for each on chain program?
programs can't be modified
yeah it uses statics which aren't allowed
cool, thanks for confirming
what does this mean on stake?
<@!466984915376799748> I found my issue: I had started from this template https://github.com/mvines/solana-bpf-program-template and had not realize there was a 'integration.rs' there
Thanks so much for sharing how I can find which instruction is referenced! That is super helpful to know. But is my assumption correct that I should not use `Pubkey::new_unique()` in an on-chain program? Is that the problem here? But then how to I get a new keypair or pubkey?
nice
yup
> self-transfer
so I write a tx to transfer lamports to myself, and that'll be a no-op?
that way each tx will be treated as unique
yeah if you want to do the same thing multiple times, you just need a new blockhash or you can append a self-transfer of a random amount
the context here is wanting to do a `settle` tx on Serum, and in some cases the data you send won't change (except the blockhash)
Attempting to create an NFT but when running `spl-token accounts` the token accounts are marked as `AUX` and need to be garbage collected. Can't seem to find much info on this through search; anywhere to learn whats up?
so you typically shouldn't have a reason for resubmitting the same tx yourself
ah, well it's not a big deal on the cluster but just so you know the rpc servers take care of retrying tx's for you
```
00000000000085a8 <solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey::new_unique>
    4277        bf 16 00 00 00 00 00 00 r6 = r1
    4278        18 01 00 00 88 f8 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 r1 = 0x1f888 ll
    4280        79 12 00 00 00 00 00 00 r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 + 0x0)
```
So I guess I shouldn't use `Pubkey::new_unique`?
that it can make me run into the error above I guess
depends what you mean by hazardous
even if you're genuinely trying to repeat the transaction
am I correct in saying that reusing a non-expired blockhash in client code is hazardous? Because if the data in the transaction you're sending is the same as what you sent before, you'll get `"This transaction has already been processed"`
Thanks
That worked, haha only 27 more bugs to fix!
i think you can also just derive Clone for it?
Thanks 🙂
`cargo build-bpf --dump`
Can someone please point me to where the structure of the `data` field of a token account is documented? I need to find the owner address.
Thought I tried that but I guess in my sleep deprived state last night I forgot to import borsh lol. Now all I am getting is "the trait `Clone` is not implemented for `GameState`"
I have no clue... I will see if I can make a dump...
Know what your program is doing at instruction#4280?  If you `--dump` your program you can look up the instruction number
you can probably reference the SPL- Governance and Metaplex prjects as well. as I recall they heavily use enums.
`Access violation in program section at address 0x10001f888 of size 8 by instruction #4280`
what happens if you put `#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, PartialEq, Debug)]` above the `GameState` declaration?
I would check the program test and pay attention to the comments, which are usually really good throughout the code base.  From what I remember the program test and banks client is meant for a 'client' like experience and may include only 1 primary payer or keypair, simulating more of a wallet like experience, may be wrong off hand.  Im sure you could always experiment and or modify it for your testing needs, especially for multi-payer simulation, where necessary.  usually testing like this is a stage 2 or greater implementation after a basic foundation is built. im not sure off hand if using multiple banks clients would work if they need to utilize the same blocks or chain tho.
What is the full violation message?
the trait `BorshSerialize` is not implemented for `GameState`
```rust
pub enum GameState {
    Initalized,
    InProgress,
    Finished,
    NotFound,
}

#[account]
pub struct Game {
    pub state: GameState,
    pub players: Players,
    pub startTime: u64,
    pub length: u64,

}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = user, space = 8 + 664)]
    pub GameData: Account<'info, Game>,
    pub user: AccountInfo<'info>,
    pub system_program: AccountInfo<'info>,
}
```
like this
<@!453347985628200960> ^
I'm trying to debug an `Access violation in program section...` by running a test locally with `RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo test-bpf` but the stack trace show the crucial part as `mycrate::mycrate::{{closure}}` Anything I can do to find out more details? I feel a bit stuck now...
do you have an example? They work fine for me, though I haven't used them in Solana
Just an unsigned int I assume?
Looks like rust enumes wont play nice with BorshSerialize, what type should I use inplace of an enum?
Yes but I believe it requires a lot of overhead. Also, it really depends on printing fees of children editions. If the minting fees are priced the same as the master edition minting fees, then it won't scale well.
maybe something to that effect would serve your needs
arent there master tokens that can print children?
Basically I'm looking into creating an NFT based badge system. I thought of initially minting an NFT per user who earns a badge, but this doesn't scale really well. So now I'm thinking more towards a multi-owner NFT where I can continue on adding owner post mint. What do you think?
I'm trying to make a minimal version
you can invite me `@jstarry`
can you push a temp github repo that I can look at?
yeah, I think that's right
if I understood correctly
so not create_account() on a pda
yup
yes but I need bpf because the other one does not support accounts that change size
makes sense, cargo test doesn't use the bpf vm
it's an issue I have with `cargo test-bpf` but not `cargo test`
so do you see a file named "xxxx.so" in your `target/deploy` dir?
my bad it was not that (I though it was the name of the test functino but actually not): https://sebsauvage.net/paste/?9a79b90ceea0cd07#c6UlQkkjiSJ057NJG+g9OpftL9WfNnRser/YUd+WhY0=
Oh there are syscalls in that file?
Just the sys calls I think, but I've extracted all the code from it and just added it locally.
Please see the stack dump linked here
<@!453347985628200960> https://github.com/solana-labs/llvm-project/issues/16

Hi, I'm new to Solana and just getting started. Has anyone tried running a local solana cluster on the Mac M1? I keep getting this error when I try to start a local cluster `dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/libssl.1.1.dylib` I tried uninstalling openssl and reinstalling it but I get the same error. Would appreciate any help.
hmm well hard to know what's going on without looking at the code at this point
so now it's sth different
when I was using a wrong name
and `Program file data not available for xxxx`
what was?
it was `solana_program_test] Possible bogus program name. Ensure the program name (xxxx) matches one of the following recognizable program names:`
hmmm
and the string "bpf_program_template" is nowhere in my code base
well that's what the panic means :/
ah ok
they do, I had a different error message just before due to this
need to make sure the name of your *.so and the string in the ProgramTest setup match
Trying to run cargo test-bpf, I get "thread 'test_validator_transaction' panicked at 'Unable to locate program bpf_program_template'", what did I miss?
its some great looking code, and appears fairly flexible, you might be able too, would just have to look and see if it can be utilized toward something you want to do. You could customize and do with it what you want, if desired, or use as intended. if your just looking for multi-sign capability, there are already multi-signer capabilities, and anchor also has a multi-sig implementation,  if all your looking for is multi-signers on transactions.
Doing so now
ok
<@!411440709812486144> Can you file an issue, lets continue the conversation there
any way to avoid this? I asked my coworker to do this, but it's probably easier if you're just talking to one person
<@!453347985628200960> clang++ with no -target bpf works well, but clang++ -target bpf gets us a stack dump

Haven't seen that before, have you looked at the source file, anything suspect there?
That doesn't look like a stdlib issue, but a front-end issue compilng the palisade cpp file.

Hello! Is there a doc/tuto for solana-program-test, besides the autogenerated one on docs.rs?
https://docs.rs/solana-program/1.7.12/solana_program/sysvar/recent_blockhashes/index.html
if a version your using, or the current one, does not have a 'get' supported for that sysvar, you may still have to pass it in.

Hi all. Are there any form of get last block hash of solana blockchain inside a smart contract?
😄
Thanks so much for the help y'all
definitely want pubsub to be a reliable service in the near future so if there are any complaints we can prioritize them
for sure. will try to do that more.
thx joshua
btw <@!785084693023424542> when devs report things that seem broken, can you encourage them to write issues or check if there already is one?
not to mention logs being used as kind of event emitters, instead of actual composed events?
yeah this is another thing that needs fixing. Maybe <@!383348505491668993> can take a look? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/19072
yeah, in fact sometimes happens that when i invoke the onLogs() method, it rejects the connection since it says that the program has too many nodes listening. The struggle is that you can't handle these errors in the callback since the error messages are simply printed via a console.log() and not returned
having more details in a github issue would be really awesome. If we can repro this issue, it makes it much easier to fix quckly
im not sure the websockets are %100 reliable for all events with the massive amount of subscribes. i think people have better results polling, and thats probably better anyway.
Hi all. Are there any form of get last block hash inside a smart contract?
it's just me or the `onLogs` method doesn't seem to work properly sometimes? Sometimes (like now) the websocket gives up in getting new transactions even if they have been processed/finalized.
Thanks so much , let me go thru it.
tysm. I got `onSlotUpdate` to work, but expected it's behavior to change if the WS endpoint was taken out, but that wasn't the case. I'll try the other one you mentioned.
Start building for x86-64
hmm you could probably do something like:
`await connection._rpcWebSocket.notify('ping');`
otherwise they will need to try and open a socket subscription like normal for websockets and test it out. a good one to try might be: 
onLogs, or onAccountChange.  With the endpoints properly configured it follows a web socket design. Where the 'on' methods listens/subscribe. and when done you can remove the listener/unsubscribe.
If they are not sure about that they should probably read up on web sockets!  All they should have to do though is called the 'onMethod' with the right parameters, and when the event is triggered on the other end it should send a response to the listener that was set up with 'on'.

the socket calls are here, to subscribe.  onMethod : https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html
psuedo code: subscribe:
`let logs_listener = connection.onLogs(filter (maybe a public key), callback (() => {})) `

Can someone comment on the compatibilty.
thanks for the info
all arithmetic operations are performed on integers. when you use f32 or f64 there type conversion routines invoked behind the scenes. same for all std math library functions. i think i fixed pow for f64 in the past but i’ll check again and for f32 too
what is the computation cost of u64 to compare with f32/f64?
Anyone have experience building with Unity on Solana? I've never built on the blockchain before and wondered if any developers might be available.
I bought the mindset of NO FLOAT allowed from Solidity to Solana 😦 big mistake, I should use f32 instead of u64 in some variables? is this right?
thanks. i’ll check f32 pow when i’m back at the keyboard
will let you know
ok thanks
you can try f64. i’m afk at the moment and can’t check
Could you point me in the right direction here? I'm not able to find anything, I'm sorry 😅

Would you mind sharing your package.json? Maybe there’s a version mismatch on some package…
there should be a ping function, to run on the connection.socketendpoint ..
Try calling https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getaccountinfo with encoding set to `jsonParsed` on the token account.
Im trying to use this power function:
`let power_factor :f32 = f32::powf((10000.0 + bond_yield) / 10000.0,30.0/365.0);`

but got this error:

Is power and float not available in Solana Rust?
hi lads,
Hey, I'm new to solana. Suppose I want to setup an "auction program", where users can bid on some token. Is there a way to avoid transaction fees on failed transactions? Consider the following scenario: curent bid is 1 SOL, and both users A and B want to bid 2 SOL, but A is a little faster. Then B's transaction will fail, but he still has to pay transaction fees (as far as I understand). Is there a way to avoid this?

<@!411440709812486144> btw, I'm able to recreate the issue you are seeing with `sol_log_params`, looking into it now, thanks for finding it
anyone?
Briefly looking at the dependencies, I don't see any obvious blockers.  But you'll have to tinker with gnu to get it to work.  BPF is a 64-bit architecture so it should compile like x86-64 as long as there isn't any assembly
I guess my last question would be, what's a good way to test that this is configured properly?
Hi I'm trying to get the token mint address of a token account through the client API. Can anyone guide me on this ?

Can you share what you are trying to accomplish, maybe that will help focus the discussion
To pull in the 64-bit stuff: https://code.woboq.org/gcc/include/gnu/stubs.h.html
I would assume I have them, since it compiles with no issue and TS doesn’t complaint either… i did just copy the file though, as im not using the rest of metaplex…
Awesome, thanks for the help y'all
I'm using your flavor, but I'm not sure what you mean by defining __x86_64__
To use the metadata.ts from metaples
Nope just need the valid dependencies
Did you have to do anything special? Looks like me and <@411537626546438144> are getting an error there
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/web3.js/src/util/url.ts#L1
Usually just setting the endpoint is enough, since the wss endpoint is inferred.
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#ConnectionConfig.__type.wsEndpoint
the issue above is usually with configuration and not knowing how to setup and configure http and socket connection end points:
they should be able to do something like this: changing the url to the intended destination. 
`let connection = new Connection('http://localhost', {
        wsEndpoint: ws://localhost:8900/,
      });`
if I were doing that, should I just be dropping in a regular http endpoint for the `endpoint` param? and then setting the wss in the connection object?
using the `onAccountChange` js method
I work at QuickNode. Trying to reproduce a customer issue
how are you trying to use it?
I did. I use the metaplex 'decodeMetadata' function
You can drop a websocket URL into the configuration object of `Connection` by setting `wsEndpoint`.

hi folks!
is this the only outage? or are there other issues atm
its currently working for me, i may have cached it. but if not I would checkout the github for Solana Explorer in the mean time!

also, much of the documentation is in the source: 
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/docs
i cannot speak as to why. but spl-token is an evolution like other features and mechanisms, that may be changing. in the spirit of decentralization we can promote growth. everything has a beginning. 

ethereum and erc20 were not the first forms of what they present and offer. these are still the early growth days. things will continue to change.  most will compare to what there is and what they are used to. thanks for voicing feedback.
yes
is explorer.solana.com down?
You want libudev
libgudev is a different library.
I have manjaro, i try to install libgudev  but not working
<@!585868308419444749> sorry, I just realized I can get around it by modifying the lamports directly because it's owned by the program id.
Here's the transaction: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4KndSEMibNi762oRZfSsF8oeXRjMnG9jCr3hh2pPETQrG6hfS4tN8gZHYy3S7wetZZWffx6ypbGnRUHneE141n8t?cluster=devnet
hi! I'm trying to pull signatures for a given program address. I've found `getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2` is able to pull signatures for a given program address, but `getSignaturesForAddress` is not. Is there a diffferent rpc call I should be using as `getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2` will be deprecated?
since solana's website is currently down. is there another place to read some documentation on how to use this by chance?
and <@!585868308419444749>  just ignoring that is the 3rd time solana devs are refusing to answer this.
It's a PDA owned by the executing program id
Thought I was in metaplex, apologies
Haha
Oh my bad wrong server
I am talking about storing token name and symbol for fungible arweave tokens
Account owned by which program?
I got an error when transferring lamports from an account that has Account data associated with it. I'm just confirming that this is a restriction and there's no way around it?
Last night I was trying to get wallet info into other react elements and I have a functional wallet connecting button that displays some of the account info at https://github.com/collin2469/solana-react-website/blob/main/HomeOnlyWallet.tsx derived from some of exiled apes candymachine minting site. I am trying to call information from this <Wallet /> to other pages etc (currently this wallet i have on a navbar) so I want to be able to say in a page file have it get that connection/public key (so I could use it to do other things like fetch all token accounts etc) but I haven't been able to get the information from the <wallet /> element in the navbar into any other element, in short, how would I call something like the current value of wallet.publicKey from this wallet file to an element in say a page file?

*theres also a wallet.tsx Ive uploaded to https://github.com/collin2469/solana-react-website/blob/main/wallet.tsx that the first goes through
I could atleast store token name, token symbol and token image uri as short simple strings on the program.
Hey Im using the onProgramAccountChange function on the web3 solana package and im trying to decipherthe data in the ```accountInfo.accountInfo.data``` and the buffer seems to be 0 padded at the end and consist of 73? bytes i'm pretty new to this and im not quite sure how to proceed or what to be expecting in that field
I mean EIP 20 was smart enough to do it and it has been around for years. Considering that in the initial SPL token was a no brainer
Unless there are technical challenges involved?

Are you seriously suggesting that peopl who build SPL didnt think of it?
I thought it was due to the cost of storing that much data on chain?
Because no one has built an on chain token mint info metadata spec yet.  Are you volunteering?
Hey, if you know, is that issue fixed on mainnet or it is fixed only on devnet and testnet?
Why are SPL tokens on solana without metadata?? Why do we have to put token image, token name on a GitHub repository ? This is completely opposite to decentralization

Is there a good reason for this?

transaction history
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getSignaturesForAddress

alternatively, you could get log info, or use another method, and provide filters to get the info.

you need to use WSL, or recommended linux, mac.  
WSL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
and then follow the windows, and related install directions for WSL, and building/running from source as needed.

If you have a compatible machine you could dual boot and run a linux distro
You could run off a linux compatible VM
or get your hands on a linux or mac machine

post your updates here. and someone will def try to help
can you help me to solve ?
yeah i m using windows
are you using wsl or windows?  the tool sets for solana in general are not directly windows compatible, but success with WSL.  Are you still trying to get this to work on windows?

just for background, I am creating an NFT earlier in this code, using the spl_token program . just not really sure what im getting wrong here
Use `solana rent 1000000` or whatever data length you need
my basic theory right now is that either the seeds are wrong (do I use something like ```rust
let metadata_seeds = &[
        b"metadata" as &[u8],
        &(&spl_token_metadata::id()).to_bytes() as &[u8],
        &mint_account.key.to_bytes() as &[u8] 
    ];``` or do I do something with the bump seed I get from find_program_address (do I have to combine that somehow with this?) like so: ```rust
    let metadata_seeds2 = &[
        b"metadata" as &[u8],
        &(&spl_token_metadata::id()).to_bytes() as &[u8],
        &mint_account.key.to_bytes() as &[u8],
        &[ meta_bump_seed ]
    ];```

I have a question regarding liquidity providing on Solana apps.

 If let's say my Solana app ABC mints user some $ABC tokens. Now, if the user provides liquidity on Raydium for my $ABC-USDC pool, the user receives LP tokens in return which are eligible for special rewards. Now the question is: 

1. Is it the app ABC that has to mint LP tokens to the user for providing liquidity?
2. Can the liquidity providing and eligibility for receiving rewards be done without minting the LP tokens to the user? For eg. if the user provides liquidity, they don't receive any other tokens in return. I just keep a record of the user and how much liquidity they provided which I can use to keep track while sending out rewards.
Hi! I'm trying to build from source the Solana Tool Suite, but when running the command `./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh .` I get the following error: `error: no such subcommand: '+1.51.0'` How can I solve this?
Note: You should have an 'initialize' instruction bundle with the create account instruction. The former is directed at your program which should handle any initial data state setup. for example: https://github.com/hashblock/solana-cli-program-template/blob/main/src/utils/txn_utils.rs#L93

Only actually useful tutorial on how to create and allocate an account with rust. After a long long search
echo above.
here is a solana py example: get balance, and spl token ref:
https://github.com/michaelhly/solana-py/blob/master/spl/token/client.py#L82
also 'solana balance' will give u balance of wallet in SOL, however if you want actual token balances associated with ur accounts, i think it's best to look at the spl-token program  and it's associated subcommands (e.g. account-info, accounts, balance, etc)
currently working on it outside the hackathon!
I guess I would start by producing a wallet / keygen pair (https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/file-system-wallet), then creating a token via the token program (https://spl.solana.com/token), and then looking at transferring tokens between accounts after that ... I guess that's what I did anyway to introduce myself to the feel of things ... my order is 1. create wallet 2. create token / token account 3. look at accounts (and this also then leads into executable accounts that are programs/ smart contracts) ... however i'm also a newbie too 😆
Public key is your address. `self` argument would be the object calling the method, it's passed implicitly
I'm just trying to get account balance
Sorry guys I'm new to this whole thing, How do i get my public key, is it the same as my account address? and I'm using python client, what is the `self` argument?
https://github.com/hashblock/solana-cli-program-template/blob/main/program/src/account_state.rs
Just a simple adapter of `invoke_signed`, the three params  are `instruction`, `account_infos`, and `signers_seeds`
what is the function, invoke_dex look like?
"Upload the program's shared object to the program account's data buffer"  ... so an account's data buffer is data that is required for the deployment process to be successful?
The main point is how you serialize your data in program.
not sure borsh support btreemap or not, if it didn't support
I think you can custom your serialization. take a pubkey => u16 map as a example
you can use a 4 byte for u32 as a len put in front of data then just serialize data
(32 byte for pubeky + 2 byte for u16)
final you will get  4 + ((32 + 2) * len of map) of data
because you already know how to serialize it, when you want to deserialize it, you just follow the serialize rule!
the dex_program account does not include in the `account_infos`

not exactly
you pass the serum_program_id into instruction and your program pass the whole account_infos into invoke_signed right?
For example, I want to call the interface of serum _dex in my program, i just send the serum program id in client side, but do not add the serum program id account in account_infos while call invoke_signed in my program, it indeed works well.
hmm you're right
the CPU-only then
not dig into it but when you create a new keypair, you can use it in all network.
I don't think you can, maybe you pass it into account_infos but you didn't notice?
<@!788215642070581289>THANK YOU
Does anyone has any examples of creating, storing and retrieving data using a btreemap in the program code? Not using javascript api. Thanks
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getprogramaccounts
can fetch all token accounts and you can also use their mint to check is it a NFT
the NFT metadata account details: https://docs.metaplex.com/
thanks for this info ... it really helps ... much appreciated 👍
I think it is possible but why? I think you can combine the seed which you want to use in create_with_seed into the previous step (FindProgramAddress), the FindProgramAddress will try 255 times for you to find a valid PDA.
hey
does solana-keygen new use network to get the key or it's generating using CPU only?
if you want to decode it, you will need to know how it encode it.
there are two ways to do it,
first is a old version, like token program account,
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js#L211
you can declare a layout and decode
second is to use borsh deserialize like
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/js/packages/cli/src/commands/signAll.ts#L26
no matter what you use, you have to know how program serialize it.
Hi, i saw the invoke_signed function over program said `
/// Invoke a cross-program instruction with program signatures
///
/// Note that the program id of the instruction being issued must also be included in
/// `account_infos`.
pub fn invoke_signed(
    instruction: &Instruction,
    account_infos: &[AccountInfo],
    signers_seeds: &[&[&[u8]]],
)`

the note says the `program id` must also be included in `account_infos`, but it seems that i do not add `program id` in `account_infos`, the invoke also works well.
Does that mean there is no necessary to send the `program id account ` in client to reduce the data length of sending tx?
Hello guys, I'm looking to build something similar to collabland on solana (basically you verify that you own a certain NFT) do you have any tips? is there an api where i can confirm that a certain NFT is owned by a certain address?

Thank you!
Can you please tell me if I create a derived address using find_program_address and then use it as a base in create_with_seed, is there a chance that the new address will be on a curve?
a server can handlle 1000s of requests
its a limit per ip not per computer
and thats not how it works
Don't worry about it
They have servers
Yes so i need to have 500 ip addresses (20k / 40) so 500 servers to handle the demand
Hi Team!

Since many protocols(Ethereum 2.0, Algorand and more) are putting BLS12 to use for digital signatures.
I want to verify BLS 12 based signature on SOLANA!!

Is there any way to achieve this?
don't know if I should be decoding this, or if I can hahaha

are there any issues on mainnet atm?
Solana will have things in place to handle huge demand on its rpc nodes
I think 40 requests per 10 sec is per IP
But the default rpc only accepts 40 requests par 10 sec so if I have actually 10k people on my website that try to mint the system won't handle it correctly
dont have a separate backend to route traffic
lol, just use solana's default rpc
Wtf..
So I need to have 500 servers to handle all the requests ?
anyone got any tips for handling data returned as Uint8Array?
yes ser
Hello, I am working on a nft project and I saw the RPC limitations (of 40 call/ip/10sec) but I plan my website to have much more concurential traffic (around 20k), so I need to have a big bunch of servers (with differents ip adresses) and a load balancer in front to balance the requests to my servers
Is it correct ?
Ok so probably I will download the newer version of cli and retry
It worked after upgrade to v1.7.12
I am trying to do an upload to the devnet and my metadata worked fine before. But now it’s throwing errors while uploading assets using metaplex. Anyone encountered this issue or know how to resolve this?
It'll be fine, we aim to be fully backwards compatible.  If you find issues please let us know, but there currently aren't any that I'm aware of
want to know if the cli version is `1.7.x` while the cluster version is `1.6.x`, will there be any problems?
Don't know why😂
ok great, but please note that 1.6.26 has no program deployment improvements over 1.6.25.
Yeah, i update to `1.6.26`, everything is ok,
The 1.7.12 release has significant improvements to program deployment.  Hopefully that'll improve the situation for you as well
I often encounter the same problem when i deploy a program. Does anyone know how to solve it?
People, hello! Do I understand correctly that when creating an associated account, the sender will sponsor its creation?
The version is `solana-cli 1.6.25 (src:7de8a55b; feat:3623616870)`, must i upgrade the solana version?
Hi, when i deploy program,got `Transactions sent` Cyclic execution, does anyone know why?
Cool, that solves the issue. I should read the readme first. 
Thanks!
Try
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang make

Is there missing libraries from system? I suppose cargo is self-contained.
also what are the guidelines for logo size?
adding some tokens to the token-list. do new entries MUST have logoURI defined? or can we add those later
There's probably some fundamentals im just missing, Ill read through the example more carefully, sending context/state/connection seems to just go over my head tonight... Thank you!
im not sure what your code setup is, but if your referring to other components, its about how your handling context or connection in your framework setup. i think the example might demo multiple components: https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/example/ and source is in the repo. you should be able to carry over context, state, connection, etc, for your app and components, but you may have to code this based on your app setup in some way. dropping components on a page doesnt necessarily, automatically, enable functionality for everything else. its based on app design, and there are many ways to do it in many frameworks. check the source for reference and see if it helps, otherwise if you post some links to code you are having issues with someone may be able to see whats going on.
having two of the elements on the page, when one is connected the other becomes unresponsive
so added the wallet autoconnect onto the page and it autoconnected when hitting connect but none of the other wallet items on the page seem to react to getting the connection
FYI, here is some example for web3js https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/README_EN.md
Hi guys, I am wondering since 3 days. Finally decided to ask. Why are SPL tokens on solana without metadata?? Why do we have to put token image, token name on a GitHub repository ? This is completely opposite to decentralization

Is there a good reason for this?
thanks a lot!
there are more all over, but that is a start
ah ok. here is an example: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/web3.js/examples/send_sol.js
I want to transfer the native sol with a web3/client call. Thanks, I will search in the examples.
should be in the react core package, and example starter, among other things.  search on `autoconnect` from the github source, or the package. should be there, may be part of the connection
so your wanting to transfer the native sol, lamports?  inside a program or a web3/client call.  its a SystemProgram.transfer. There are some samples. The web3 examples in github may have one as well.
Is that something with the https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/blob/master/packages/core/react/src/WalletProvider.tsx ? Little confused how to detect connection/autoconnect if another element connected, is there any sort of guide for this?
great. I will try go with the first option. Do you have any example link? I only found examples of transfers of spl tokens, none of sol balance of other account different than the main account.
thanks for the response. we'll look over the parent function first. really appreciate the help
its total data size I believe, so it depends, but a good range .. depends on your instructions  your passing
Instructions can be arbitrarily sized (within the total transaction limit).  Can't really give any fast and loose rules like that.  You'll have to inspect the instructions and see what's up
gotcha, so we're going over the limit of `PACKET_DATA_SIZE = 1280 - 40 - 8`, but we're not sure which is causing this. is it most likely that we're adding too many instructions for that specific transaction? and if so, is there like a recommended range of instructions to avoid errors like this?
yes if you own an account you can transfer the balance. if you want you can issue a close instruction and transfer the remaining balance to an address as well.
there should be an auto connect like feature in there, and you can use context, state, effect to carry over the state and actions, by just referencing the connection/provider/wallet context you want to keep reusing, detecting if its connected, auto connect/stay connected if necessary/allowed.
the error is trying to say you his the size limit.
I got it to work ty
Can be transfered the sol balance of the owned created account?
hi, we're getting an `Unhandled Rejection (AssertionError): Transaction too large: 2689 > 1232` error when trying to serialize a signed transaction via `transaction.serialize()`. tracing it goes back to line 614 on this file: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/b2413f0/src/transaction.ts#L572

any ideas what could be causing it? the signed transaction has an array of 31 instructions in it along with 10 signatures.
This might be a stupid question, but when using react wallet adapter to connect to a wallet, exporting the const wallet that can be called to create a button to connect wallet which works and shows the shortened pubkey but how can I export that to other react components such that you dont have to hit connect wallet again? Surely theres a way to separate the connection and components that use the wallet to sign transactions etc?

Hi All, anyone knows if there is a way to get USD value of the wallet balance by using sol/web3.js ?
`TokenAccountsFilter: { mint: PublicKey } | { programId: PublicKey }`
the way I understand it, i have to put the token contract address here?
thanks for reply! that function asks for a `TokenAccountsFilter` object
I can make PRs, just need direction how how to solve the issue
...
also the new wallet-adapter does not support localnet
Should web3js `Cluster` type have localnet? It is quite a pain to had workarounds everywhere just to be able to run on localnet
you can use https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getTokenAccountsByOwner
to fetch token account by owner and it will return token account's info. you can parse these data to get token balance
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html
which function in Connection is used to get SPL tokens of a wallet? I'm able to run connection.getBalance() successfully and get account data, but it only shows SOL balance not balance of other tokens...

hi folks
hi <@!823289158247776318>  is this for the ignition hackathon? Let us know if you get this working! Yes unfortunately VRF isn't live yet on Solana, the team's currently focusing on delivering Price Feeds for mainnet
Cool. So to be clear, it would be expected for user experience in the future that when an NFT is sent away that the SOL should be reclaimed automatically by the wallet? Actually, all these zero-balance token accounts are clogging up the system in the same way that the Rent feature was designed to prevent
Don't think so.  Should be a little over 0.002 SOL each, unless someone messed up and put in more
Ok interesting, thank you. Is there a way to see on the Explorer how much SOL is reclaimable for a particular zero-balance token account?
Should be able to close them all with sollet.  There are some browser hacks to  enable that feature though.  Folks in #sollet on the project serum discord can help you
Looks like the answer is YES. Here's an example: https://explorer.solana.com/address/G1UJrBd35WwsTcvkj1ovWew7u9tzKwD4XsnGmYGNWH7C/tokens
Might have to check the explorer
Do you have a bunch of zero-balance token accounts on your wallet?
Ok interesting, so all the NFTs that I've held but sent away probably have some SOL waiting to be claimed?
Phantom does not do this. Neither does Sollet
Question for them
Doubt it
Do you know if Phantom handles that automatically when I send an NFT away?
It's not reclaimed automatically, it's _reclaimable_.  You'd still need to issue a close instruction on the account
So my balance in my wallet will show as 0 SOL, but there will be SOL in the 0-token-balance accounts that my wallet keypair controls
You have to still close the account
So let's say I only have enough SOL in my account to cover a transaction fee. I send the NFT using the SOL I had for the transaction fee. Now that the NFT is gone, the SOL is reclaimed, and I should now have a very small balance from the reclaimed SOL, not 0 SOL. Is that right?
After you send it, the remaining zero-token-balance account can be closed.  At which point the SOL is reclaimed
Ok cool, and to clarify this, do I get SOL back when I send the NFT, or do I need to destroy the NFT to get its SOL?
Lower.  NFTs are just an SPL Token mint with special parameters
So would that be Metaplex, the minting company, or something lower level than that?
That's not up to your wallet.  The token program ensures that its accounts are always rent-exempt
Cool, and just to clarify, is my wallet attaching a sufficient amount to SOL to the NFT so that it will never be charged rent when I receive the NFT? I'm asking because you said that I would regain the SOL if I send the NFT somewhere else
I am looking at using Token Program to create and keep tokens in Account. Besides Account rent, is there any other fee for maintaining token in Account or transfering token between Accounts?
Well... you can reclaim the SOL if you transfer the NFT to another account
Hmm, so the NFTs have SOL attached to them that cannot be separated from them?
That is, each of those NFTs has their own non-zero SOL  balance to keep them extant
There's no requirement for the controlling keypair to also be a funded system account
The NFTs are their own native account, your main wallet's keypair just controls them
That's not how it works.
Thanks trent, that makes sense.

Do you know what would happen if you had a 0 SOL balance, but your account has 3 NFT collectibles stored. Would rent be taken out when you add new SOL back to the account?
Yep.  Zero or greater than the rent-exempt-reserve for the data size
Ok cool so there will be no rent charged as long as I make it a 0 balance
If you come back to the same address later, it'll be reallocated upon deposit
No. Zero SOL balance accounts are reclaimed by runtime
Question on Rent: What happens when a person transfers all their SOL out of an account and makes the balance 0? Then what happens if they come back a week later and reload the same wallet again to make the balance 10 SOL? Will they be charged rent for the time the account had a 0 balance?
You can if you write a VRF oracle first
I was thinking about developing a simple luck game 😭

I am building multiple programs such that one program must be able to call an instruction that exists within another. What is the best way to do this in rust? I am confused on how to leverage: https://docs.rs/solana-program/1.6.4/solana_program/instruction/struct.Instruction.html#structfield.data
you might be able to discuss or help or partner with the wormhole 
https://wormholebridge.com/#/  they have discord, githubs, and nework, as well.
when you get information it generally has to be parse and or decoded. calling other programs directly generally requires information about them, more so if they have not published any materials to help interact with their protocol. Its based on what you need. You can usually call getAccountInfo getProgramAccounts and getTokenAccountsByOwner, along with filters, in addition to their parsed versions 'getParsedAccountInfo' that tend to follow the same structure to decode, where you can at least retrieve general account and program info. 
The raydium github is here and they have instructions posted on their github. 
https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-contract-instructions
Other apps may have other published materials. 
I would search for the githubs, and or discords, and try to ask for help or where they might have integration guides.

Hi, is it possible to send multiple tokens in one transaction ? I would like to find a way to combine multiple NFT in one NFT
Hi there, my name is Tari and I work for a project called Strudel Finance. We created a trustless bridge linking bitcoin to ethereum blockchain. I was wondering if I would be able to speak with a dev about a potential partnership?
I've been having to dig into the node module itself to figure things out. Some obvious things don't exist, others just are very poorly documented. I would try looking through the module to figure things out it's helped me somewhat.
metaplex won't let me verify when I join seems like other people are having the same issue
How can I use RCP or JS API to query a given AMM program (e.g. Orca V2 or Raydium) such that I retrieve (1) all the LP token accounts available and (2) for each pool account, all the associated accounts so I can construct a swap transaction using the SPL Token Swap program template, which is what they all seem to use (i.e. empty pool state account, pool authority account, etc. etc.)

I tried using getProgramAccounts(), but that returns the accounts with no particular structure.
I'm finding it difficult to navigate this, because the APIs for some of these AMMs are either nonexistent or not that well-developed yet. Any help appreciated.
So, an Account can be owned by a program, but not by a user address? What I want is to fetch the data associated with some user address by passing the user address to some RPC (getProgramAccounts, getTokenAccountsByOwner, or other). So to achieve this, tell me if this makes sense: I am going to create a program that creates Accounts, where each of these Accounts has two things: a user address and some data. Then to get the data associated with some user address X, I call the RPC getProgramAccounts(withTheIdOfTheProgramIMade, withAFilterThatTestsIfTheAccountUserAddressEqualsX).
```{
   "jsonrpc":"2.0",
   "id":1,
   "method":"getProgramAccounts",
   "params":[
      "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"
   ],

      }
   }
}```  Having a hard-time with the filters.  How am I supposed to check if Account FEYoQzR8gRc2ZgGKs36pD3w5hzBbWKtGCvQJ1JdQY4vz  owns any SPL with UPDATE authority = 4drW3cpobroupcN5188QP1dTTkaXxJrge6v9kZDpiLJQ ?
ty
it kept giving the above error
all i did was modify the hello world script, by adding a check variable in the struct and added an if condition which checked if the input variable is a odd or even number, i logged the messages and i was getting the correct answer but when i tried to store it by serializing it 
" greeting_account.serialize(&mut &mut account.data.borrow_mut()[..])?;"
i keep getting this error "'Program Hy5Z6FPk4xrVdR5k9TD6teTneN6eXGXfeZzqw5i5SPiN failed: Failed to serialize or deserialize account data: Unkown'
"
really struggling with the serialization and deserialization concept
Yes. You can use `getProgramAccounts` along with filters.
you can use PublicKey.IsOnCurve
You can use `getProgramAccounts` with the program being the spl program. You can see an example of doing this here in Serum https://github.com/project-serum/serum-dex-ui/blob/master/src/utils/tokens.tsx#L78
I need SPL API for determining all address holders of a specific contract token.
Then, how would I fetch that data later knowing only the user address? Through the RPC getProgramAccounts? https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getprogramaccounts
Account is a Solana basic data entity. Even programs are accounts. Tokens are a data abstraction produced by a Token program. Using the Token program you create a mint account which you use to mint tokens in a token account. Each token you or somebody else creates creating a mint needs its own account ( user has separete accounts for a separate token/mint ).
How to check if an address is a valid SOL address?
Tokens != Accounts. If you want to associate some data to an address, you can create an account with the data. Read into the account structure here https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts
What I'm basically trying to achieve is check if a certain Account owns at least one SPL token which has mint authority address equal to some specific address. I reckon this would be possible with two calls and not only one, correct?
Hello. Sorry for my ignorance. What is the difference between a Token (from the SPL) and an Account? Is a Token an Account? If I want to associate some data to some user address (in a way that it can be fetched later only by knowing the user address) should I use a Token or an Account?
It is more a question for Metaplex discord, but I heard that it is Metaplex that is paying for now. I seen in their PRs that they will have a Arweave upload price inside the UI, so things are going to change. As for paying with Sol, the idea is that the bundlers, Arweave upload nodes will accept payments in any currency and handle the ar payments.
<@!401880349166141441> quick question on arweave. When metaplex uploads an image we don't need to have ar on our account as we directly pay with SOLs.

In the code I see the sols are send to an hardcoded solana wallet, I don't really understand what's going on.

Do you have some explanations or a link to some docs how to pay an arweave upload with sols?
You can look at the algorithm here
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#hash-based-generated-program-addresses
Its a simple iteration. The bump will be the same for the same seed.
You will get the same pda address and a same bump.
I have a question regarding PDAs. Calling `find_program_address(my_seed)` with a set seed will give me a pda and the bump. If I want to deterministically get this PDA somewhere else down the line, would calling `find_program_address(my_seed)` give me that same PDA, or is there a chance that a different bump gets used?
It’s more of a feature request, there is no way to determine if connection to a wallet failed due to dapp being not connected to phantom(not trusted) or if wallet is locked(pw is required in phantom)
Thanks. I'm trying to keep as much as I can on-chain, so that the program can be more tamper proof. The more I push functionality outside of the program, the more susceptible to corruption it is
1. No, maybe try with a offchain agent ( using slotSubscribe )
2. No
3. I don't think it is possible inside of a program. Programs don't know about past transactions, only about passed account states. Again its a job for a offline agent/client.
Are you using a token mint address? Usually that error comes up if you are inputting the incorrect address
Are you using intel or m1 mac?
What questions do you have? We usually recommend using https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold
Hello! Any idea how to check if an address owns at least one token minted by a specific address? I tried getTokenAccountsbyOwner  but I'm getting "Token mint could not be unpacked".
Or where I should ask questions regarding connecting my dapp to phantom?

They both show how to read/write data from an account within a program
The latter doesn't seem possible. The program would need to store the address of the created account somewhere.
You can create the account before you deploy it and hard code the address into your program, or you can have the program create the account
Hmm... But how would the program know the address of the account?
My understanding is that it would have to be stored in a separate account and your program will have to read the data from the account at runtime
1) Can a smart contract, run on an event(start/end of epoch)?
2) Can a smart contract, make RPC API calls?
3) What's the best approach for querying transactions to a specific address that occurred during a specified epoch? Within a smart contract...
anyone else get `Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status` using https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com ? everything works fine w/ main-net on local and it only seems to happen in production

I'm still struggling with `Error: Account allocation failed: RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Transaction loads a writable account that cannot be written ` on a mainnet deployment. I've changed CLI versions and tried different buffer accounts, nothing is working. Any insight would be super helpful
I want to use Next JS because I think it is more performant, and I love the speed, but it looks like unless the @solana/wallet-adapter-material-ui node module is fixed, I can't do what I want
There are css import issues when I try to use solana's wallet-adapter-react-ui and es6 compiling issues when I try to use the material-ui version and other issues when I try to use the antd version in Next JS. How can I raise this as an issue with the Solana devs
but that isnt the actual wallet and you cant do much with it
You can do a <NavLink to={{pathname:'/holdings', state:{WpublicKey:wallet.publicKey?.toBase58()}}} >Holdings</NavLink> and then on the other page do a const { state: { WpublicKey }} = useLocation<{WpublicKey?: web3.PublicKey }>();
so you end up with the string of the public key on the other page
well in that case I can tell you that passing the wallet through props/useLocation() is a no go, you get errors that you cant clone the config or something
seems we look for the same thing, more or less
so I am stuck trying to pass the wallet to different pages of my site... but on the element that has all the wallet code + buttons you can do 

const wallet = useWallet()
blahblah code wallet.publicKey
Hi,
I am connecting wallet adapter to my react UI.
But I can't find a way to retrieve the Public key from the logged account...
I'm getting to search everywhere but cant get it.
Can someone redirect me where I can learn more on how to pass info from wallets  to variable I can use?

Next step will be to use the datas to create token / mint and do bunch of stuff... sure I would love to get explanation.

I feel I'm throwing some stuff in a lost thread, but this is where I arrived from clocking the "get help"

(funny thing is I can code react, can code rust programs but have no idea how to make them interact XD)
I feel like thats not the solution if I want to do anything that involves sending transactions etc to the network from those pages?
would it be better to have everything I need involving the wallet to be done in the navbar component and then only pass the results as props(?) to the other pages?
will do.
See the links above for instruction 😉
how do you go on about making wrappers for a non-anchor program, i have almost very basic rust experience hence my desire to use anchor
There's probably some missing APIs. Feel free to open a PR to add anything missing. The APIs are added on an as needed basis currently.
hey <@!501570363566587905>  ty for responding, also is the anchor wrapper for the spl cover the full functionality of spl
Here's an example of making anchor wrappers for the SPL token program https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/blob/master/spl/src/token.rs.

And an example using it https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/blob/master/tests/spl/token-proxy/programs/token-proxy/src/lib.rs

You can do something similar with the metaplex contracts https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex
is there any tutorial or resource out there to write smart contracts using anchor  wrapper of spl token to make nfts or anything similar ?
Anyone here who has attempted to make nft smart contracts like we did in erc 721 obv using the spl token but customised them using anchor, metaplex did it but using vanilla solana
yup, looks fine
<ConnectionProvider endpoint="https://solana-api.projectserum.com">
        <WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect>
            <WalletModalProvider>
                <NavbarSansProvider />
            </WalletModalProvider>
        </WalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
is my outermost component, then NavbarSansProvider has the multi button etc, and contains a router with the other pages, so it should be?
check that `WalletProvider` is upper than your component
emm, `useWallet` just gets value from the context, so I guess it's not related
the wallet multi button shows the address correctly, and I have a thing that prints the public key on the navbar for testing that works properly
when i do log in to the wallet on the navbar it does give:
Unhandled Rejection (QuotaExceededError): Failed to execute 'setItem' on 'Storage': Setting the value of 'walletName' exceeded the quota.
I've just ignored it since it seemed to work fine... but is that related? Perhaps that issue is why my useWallet doesnt work?
is it connected?
<@!847130012879814668>  dmed
tried:
const wallet = useWallet()
console.log(wallet.publicKey)
and that just returns undefined
Did you try to use `useWallet()` wherever you need it? 🙂
(react) how can I properly pass down the wallet instance to other components?
<@!445019022338031618> Try understanding the candy machine... That has helped me
Hey
are there any resources that help understanding the metaplex smart contracts as the source code is quite extensive and in vanilla solana, does their exist a anchor wrap of it or any tutorial that builds on top of metaplex say modify there smart contracts for additional functionality etc.
Anyone that had success with integrating a wallet with the game engine unity?
is it only me or is solana website down from time to time? I have a suspicion that if you use too much the airdrop on devnet/testnet, your ip gets blacklisted from both the faucet, the rpc node and the actual website. When I use a different ip the website works
Where can I find a list of popular token addresses on devnet? e.g. the USDC spl token?
<@!796385050572488724> https://spl.solana.com/token#wrapping-sol

and I have 7 sol in test

Hey there - hitting same problem you mentioned 4 days ago. Did you manage to convert the base64 data returned from calling getProgramAccounts() to something meaning full / useful instead of a array of digits? If so, how did you do this?  Thx very much for any hint of a solution...
hey folks, have a couple of questions about the sysvar clock:

1. Is the unix_timestamp I will get from the clock nondecreasing in real time? (i.e. is clock.unix_timestamp in a transaction at t1 <= clock.unix_timestamp in a transaction at t2 where t1 <= t2 in real, global time)
2. what's the typical drift of the timestamp? how large is it in magnitude?

we are pegging to some real-time events, so using the ts to allow/disallow actions (e.g. can't do action x after a timestamp passes) would be convenient

trying to get the instance of the const wallet = useWallet() from a navbar component into one of the pages, tried passing wallet as a prop and then in the other component:

I'm realizing that mainnet is on version `1.6.25` and my CLI and program uses `1.7.11`

Can anyone explain the error message?
Hello all, I am working on a Metaplex candy machine clone. When I try and call program.rpc.mintNFT, I get the following error: Translating error TypeError: this.wallet.signTransaction is not a function
I need some help 😦 I keep getting the following error when trying to deploy a program to mainnet `Error: Account allocation failed: RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Transaction loads a writable account that cannot be written `

I've already created the buffer account, uploaded there, verified it (with anchor's verifiable build), and now I'm trying to put it on the final address I want. I can send explorer links to addresses if needed
oh! awesome! Thanks you!
So do as I said, `solana config set -ul`.  Presumably you can withstand errors on a localcluster should one be running
okay, will try
I'm now in the habit of always `-um`, `-ud`, `-ut` every command
not it's not required even if I delete default config 😦
or force me ot provide `--url`
Mmm, you can just use -u
`-C, --config <FILEPATH>                Configuration file to use`
I just set my default RPC URL to localhost to prevent yoloing the wrong cluster
I dunno what -C is
hmm, okay
is there an option to FORCE me to use `-C` every time so not to screw up messing devnet and mainnet?
There are some known working public DNS services in <#749059399875690557>

Maybe, will try again later. Thanks
Guys please help, if i need to create huge staking pool where should i storage all stakers and how should i extract them and loop thru them for reward counting?

Maybe still some lingering DNS issues?
Fine here, faucet has 2M SOL.
No airdrop 🙂 I've seen a few exceptions today
By what measure of "down"?   It's fine here, just airdropped myself
got it, thank you
Someone know what this error means:
```
Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0xa6 
```
Sent to devnet. I don't have a testnet account, sorry <@!718188215974101052>
and if you can do that on testnet as well to the same account it would be great
yes please, to `2V28D3jzn7XEuKSqVVzDyXB3YMg8mfWE9QVvvkNvxEWw` 10 should be fine
Looks like devnet is down again. I can send you some tokens if you need.
I thought that devnet has 10 and testnet has 1
something is wrong with airdrops on devnet? isn't the cap set to 10 SOL? I'm getting:
```
Instruction 0

hi I have a terminology q: what's the relationship between a shred, entry, and batch? the docs at various points lean on each, but they all seem to mean: the atomic set of transactions signed by the leader and sent to a single peer. maybe there's nuance?
ooops
*homer-bushes.gif*
You don't need either if all you want is the default
ah, I should use ASK rather than prompt:
kinda unobvious 🙂
I copypasted provide seed from `new`

why recover using seed phrase recovers different address?
the result is coming from a getProgramAccounts call
the "data" field is contained in program_data var, the other parameters says base64
Recommend using solana/web3.js to get the data jsonParsed. Also, depending how the data is encoded changes how to you decode it
need some help reading "data" parameter from result. Anyone has an idea what am I doing wrong?
Maybe these tests will be a good starting point: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/web3.js/test/secp256k1-program.test.ts

Hi! I'm suffering the DNS problems, can anyone please share ip addresses for public devnet and mainnet api nodes?
ahhh just DNS is down, okie thanks
ive been using devnet continuously this entire time the DNS issues have been a problem for others, it isn't down, so you might be able to find out its IP address and use that if you can't resolve the DNS errors
devnet and testnet still down?
not sure is it help, but you can take a look at https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/js
is there any other way to create the metadata account? does metaplex have a JS library ?
you can take a look at https://spl.solana.com/token#example-wrapping-sol-in-a-token
the wrapped sol can be transfer by SOL
From where can I get wrapped sol tokens in my account on devnet?
```
Program log: is_signer: true, is_writable: true
    Program log: create metaplex metadata
    Program metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s invoke [2]
    Program log: Instruction: Create Metadata Accounts
    Program log: Transfer 5616720 lamports to the new account
   <payers address>'s writable privilege escalated
```
and then:
that's correct, `Program log: is_signer: true, is_writable: true`
can i have any example for same?
it should be . i'll verify that for you hang on
so the log like
```rust
msg!(format!(
        "is_signer: {}, is_writable: {}",
        customer.is_signer, customer.is_writable
    ));
```
is true true right?
also i'm fairly sure that the payer shouldn't also be the mint authority. but I've been having trouble refactoring the code ; no other account will actually let the tokens mint
i'm not sure if something bad happens when two accounts that are supposed to sign it are the same?
it might make more sense, if you can see my code:  ```rust
invoke_signed(
        &spl_token_metadata::instruction::create_metadata_accounts(
            spl_token_metadata::id(),
            *meta_account.key, //meta account
            *mint_account.key, //mint account
            *customer.key, //mint auth
            *customer.key, //payyer
            *customer.key, //update authority
            "Name".to_string(), //name
            "SYMBOL".to_string(), //symbol
            "URI".to_string(), //URI
            None, //creators
            0, //seller fee (???)
            false,
            false
        ),
        &[ 
            metaplex_account.clone() , 
            meta_account.clone(), //0 `[writable]`  Metadata key (pda of ['metadata', program id, mint id])
            mint_account.clone(),  //1. `[]` Mint of token asset
            customer.clone(),  // 2. `[signer]` Mint authority
            customer.clone(),  //3. `[signer]` payer
            customer.clone(),  //4. `[]` update authority info
            system_program_info.clone(),  //5. `[]` System program
            rent_sysvar.clone(),  //6. `[]` Rent info (sysvar, confirmed in the code)
        ],
          &[metadata_seeds2]
    );
```
if the data belongs to token metadata account, the 33~65 will be the mint pubkey bytes
or you can take a look at https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/js/packages/cli/src/commands/signAll.ts#L25
so after getting a really long string of random characters, from bs58 encode used on the base64 decode, I'm supposed to find the token address at char 33 to 65? Or did I misunderstood. Sorry for being so clueless. I'm using Node by the way.
ok thanks 👍
the main point is that your schema between program and client need to be the same. so you can deserialize it correctly, but I know there are some types not support in borst-ts, you will need to check it
ok thanks, excuse my ignorance however should I be using something such as BTreeMap on the int8array in order to get the right schema?
you use base64 decode it then you will need to use bs58 encode. the data is just a u8 array, so you will need to know how program encode it first, then you can separate them into meaningful data segment
rather odd
I base64 decoded  whole data field and I'm getting
I believe after the call above you will get a bunch of accounts, all of them most likely the token metadata account, then you can parse these data, the mint is written in the data. (data[33:65])
in my keys its like ... `{pubkey: payer.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true},` and then`{pubkey: token_meta, isSigner: false, isWritable: true},` later
so yes, I have checked the status and it seems correct
using `invoke_signed` where it's signed by the PDA that is the metadata account (which is receiving this transfer, which is an IPC inside this`spl_token_metadata` program that calls `invoke` on the system program's transfer intrstruction)
Would I have to do a RPC call for each program and get the token addresses from its transactions?
and then inside the on-chain program I call `spl_token_metadata::instruction::create_metadata_accounts` as an IPC
in the invocation of the on-chain program, in JS, I make sure that the payer is writable and a signer and sign the txn with it
you call token meta program in your program via invoked_signed right? I think if it has a  writable privilege escalation error, you check the status (writable and is_signer) for your feePayer before you pass it into invoke_signed first. I not sure how you pass your account info but when I got error like signer or writable privilege escalation I will check it first then check the instruction I called.
this returns pubkeys of programs, how can I get the actual SPL token addresses though? thank you!!
Sure.
the writable priveldge escalation is in the payers address. and the payer is passed as a signer and writable, the account that its trying to transfer into is writable, so I just have no idea what's going on or how to continue
MVP!! thank you!!
it needs to be signed by both the mint authority and the payer somehow . but those are the same account , and i'm wondering if that is conflicting with what i'm trying to do . (although , the transaction is signed with this account, so I don't think there should be a problem)
and I get a writable priveledge escalation
it breaks down when it tries to transfer the lamports into the PDA for the metadata account that it's trying to create (so it can get a rent exemption)
does anyone know how exactly we're to invoke the token metadata contract? it has this big function for creating a new metadata account automatically but I can't seem to get it to work at all
Perfect, thx!
yes. PDA is like a normal account but need to use program to sign it. and the situation you described is very suitable to use PDA.
check your borsh schema, seems you don't use all data
Hi, just learning how to write Solana programs and have a dubt: have PDAs lamport and data fields just as normal addresses? In other words, can I use them directly as escrow accounts to collect funds (and some state) until some condition is met and then have the program to redistribute their fund? Thank you!
if you are searching for updated authority, I don't think you pass offset 326, the updated is the second member in Metadata struct, in front of it is the key which is u8, so I think you just pass 1 as offset
I see, thanks! You're very helpful! 🙂
not sure anyone can help?
yes. but you can't use transfer instruction because your account don't belongs to system program, you will need to use the way like token program close account.
where the recpient is a PDA
yeah, its my program. So transfering out the entire balance out will delete the account?
I call invoke_signed to call the token metadata program as a CPI
Will a VPN fix this?
the `program_id` will be the account owner. if you don't overwrite it, the most possible is your program.
Just leave it, I guess It will get fixed automatically
i'm still totally unable to get this to work. I don't really understand it because the payer is the signer and writeable, the recpient is writable. I just dont get the meaning of it
```
 // allocate oracle account
  invoke_signed(
    &system_instruction::create_account(
      payer.key,
      oracle.key,
      initial_balance,
      size_of::<Feed>() as u64,
      program_id,
    ),
    &[payer.clone(), oracle.clone()],
    &[&[&feed.name.as_bytes(), &[seed_bump]]],
  )?;
```
In this code snippet, who end up being the owner?
when you use `create_account`, you has already passed the owner into it, so it depends which program you pass as parameters
Thank you, that makes sense. Just to make sure that I understand correctly, accounts created using `invoke_signed(&system_instruction::create_account(...` are owned by the system program? or by my program?
I'm still getting errors.
did you mean https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter ?
Yea
if your account's owner is still system program, you can just transfer all SOL out, then the account will be collected (removed)
if your account has already transfer to another program (owner is not system program), you can take a look at https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L645
to retrieve all SOL from the account, then the account also will be removed.
Fixed?
`system_instructions.rs` doesn't seem to have a remove instruction
Another question: Is there a way to remove an account created by a program? So that I can create the same account (using the same seeds) again for a given program_id?
Fixed now, Thank you
Thank you!

You have to calculate the `offset`and `bytes` to match within the struct.  So for a mint, the `supply`field is 36 bytes in [1] , and then  supply of 1 is a little-endian u64, so bytes in base58 would be `Ahg1opVcGX`. I put in a hex string of `0100000000000000` to [2] to get that answer

although earlier i have added this getrandom = { version = "0.2.2", features = ["custom"] } when i have faced rand error on compilation
https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust#depending-on-rand
is there a way to prevent just anyone form calling your smart contract on solana ?or how do I verify the identity of a call to a smart contract as coming from our backend-system
What is curious is whether you get an error about `rand` when doing a `cargo build-bpf` on your program....
I have 2.03 SOL whereas the deploy requires 1.36
thank you <@!814228493302497301> , can i check if any alternate solution to this?
I am getting my command working for checking SOL address & balance tho, but when I run metaplex command everything gets crashed even the address n balance command.
<@!693486673606082580> If you are willing to rebuild the source, you can change the budget to > 200 K as a temporary to see how much units you actually consume.
My metaplex command is crashing everytime.
Maybe: check out https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust#restrictions
Looks like it's working now, airdrop just worked
Check out `solana-keygen grind`to create a vanity program id: https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-start#vanity-keypair
we've been wanting to plumb that in, and i don't think we have yet. see https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/15559 to track the progress.  you can currently do this with `solana-program-test` though.
yes correct, does that cause any issue ? 🤔 <@!814228493302497301>
check your SOL balance is enough
not sure how you pass your fee payer.
if your concern is right, I will say although your feePayer sign the tx, you still need to pass it into instruction and specifiy isSigner and isWritable,
So, the crate has `rand` as dependency yes? https://github.com/paritytech/libsecp256k1/blob/master/Cargo.toml#L15
yes 100%
Are you sure it's a reasonable signature you are passing in?
it's from libsecp256k1 crate, which is used to verify signature

```use libsecp256k1::{Message, Signature, PublicKey,verify};```
What are you doing in the `verify` routine and where is the `msg!` in relationship to that?
same dns is still fucked
any hint on this? how can i resolve this?

as you can see from last logs i have left with 156539 out of 200000
```
let is_verify: bool = verify(&message_payload, &signature, &pub_key);
```
but once code reaches this syntax, i'm getting above error, seems this single line consuming all remaining units?

any resolution for same?

how do you then set up the memcmp filter for supply and decimals?
hi, can I set solana-test-validator with a custom amount of compute units?
I’ve forked metaplex, and I’m getting this error. Any idea what this means?
When I try to deploy my program to the mainnet, I get the following error:
```
Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x1
```
But what does this mean?
dns is still fucked in google chrome
when the metaplex program tries to invoke the transfer, it gets a writable priveldge escalation on the payer . the payer is signing the transaction when its called in web3. and both the payer and the new account are writable. so i'm not really sure what's going on with it
I think my problem is unrelated to the signing. and that I'm probably doing it OK. my actual issue is this: https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/b57a335552bd00b3e2e6c41ca7aa6a3ec0c689bf/rust/auction/program/src/utils.rs#L98
devnet is down???
Please mention me
Hello, I saw in the RPC documentation that there is a limitation of 40 requests per 10 seconds and per ip adress. I plan to have 20k people who try to mint at the same time. To handle the charge, do I need to have 500 servers (20k / 40) to have 500 different ip addresses ?
im doing something like this
```rust
    let (meta_key, meta_bump_seed) = Pubkey::find_program_address(metadata_seeds,&spl_token_metadata::id());
    
    let metadata_seeds2 = &[
        b"metadata" as &[u8],
        &(&spl_token_metadata::id()).to_bytes() as &[u8],
        &mint_account.key.to_bytes() as &[u8],
        &[ meta_bump_seed ]
    ];
```
oh sorry, I mean [ [ 1, 2, 3, 4] ] as the invoke_signed seeds
if you want [1,2,3]  + 4 is that...  [  [1 , 2, 3], 4 ] or [ [ 1, 2, 3, 4] ]. it looks like you're saying I should do the former
its like. since this is a pointer to a pointer. the "+" is an ambiguous notation
not sure I understand but find_program_address will add one byte in the end of your seed to bump a PDA, it will try 255 ~ 0
so the real seed of find_program_address will be [your seeds + bump_seed_byte]
is that correct?
its two arrays , one of 3 elements, one of one element
rather than constructing an array of 4 elements that are the 3 arguments + the bump seed
its two seeds, one is an array of tthe 3 arguments into find_program_address and the other is the bump seed
wait I think I get it
ooh
you can use something like
```rust
       let seeds: &[&[_]] = &[
            your_find_program_address_seed,
            &[Pubkey::find_program_address(&[your_find_program_address_seed], &program_id).1],
        ];
```
as a seed pass into invoke_signed
Anyone getting BorshIoError when signing a transaction?
anyone know the answer to this?
Thanks
as the error message says, your balance is not enough
you can use `sol_log_compute_units`

Hey guys,
is it possible to verify bls-12 based signature in rust based smart contract?
<@!585868308419444749> although i'm getting this error due to this one line of code

```let is_verify: bool = verify(&message_payload, &signature, &pub_key);```

also can you guide me on how can i split my code/function across multiple instructions as solana works with only single entry point?
What error?
please
Could u help me
I have some problem about RPC on mainnet. When i call request, i got all the time. Even i enter the site docs.solana.com, i couldnt connect the site. Was my ip blocked by solana ?
You can't increase it.  You have to optimize and/or split your operation across multiple instructions
i'm getting this error while calling a smart contract function, any idea why i'm getting this? am i lacking with computation unit or so? if so how can i increase that?
I’m actually using the js library. I’m looking at the rust code and not sure to what to look for. I’m minting an NFT with metadata. It seems like it’s failing to serialize the metadata, but I’m not clear what part of the metadata exactly.
The delays are scammer detection
any Developer in group who can help me resolve my queries ?
Even now the solana cluster is working fine but no one is replying to our questions
i added first time .. but they merged the request wrongly and now its been 11 days till now no reply from any of the solana team member ... We are right now dependent on solana chain because we thought its good option to go on ... But we are getting zero response from Solana team and help to make sure our token is visible to our users
<@!466984915376799748> can you help me to know when will be the token name will be merged into the main branch ?
Great, yeah it's great to build a solid lower level understanding before adding layers of abstraaction
Right, his blog was awesome! I watched Twitch live about Anchor and how it generates boilerplates looked pretty cool! I might take a look later once I'm a little more comfortable writing rust code.
nice, paulx's tutorial is a great project to learn from. You could also look into migrating that program to use anchor, since that's the new way of writing solana contracts now
I'm working on a project for IGNITE hackathon!  I'm very new to Solana and blockchain technologies so I've been spending a lot of time understanding these behavior! Last night I finally managed to do Token Escrow so my next plan is actually sending SOL using SPL token. Experimenting mostly on this repo https://github.com/tomoima525/solana-sandbox
yup! are you working on a project btw or just learning how things work?
I see!
but when used, wrapped sol tokens return the balance with the rent subtracted
yup it includes the rent balance
FWIW,  I was playing around with SPL cli today to see how wrapping/unwrapping SOL works. I found that a token receiver receives more SOL than what was transferred (In my experiment Sender transferred 0.9976 SOL but Receiver got 0.9998 SOL), but this was probably because of a rent fee https://www.notion.so/Unwrap-wrap-native-token-SOL-0b5e9a84373e4424bb2a8fd2ed065cc9
yup, could be the same wallet too
oooh I see. That makes sense! so the default fee payer will be another wallet that is tied to your cli. Thanks!
whoever wants to be the funding account. The CLI uses the default fee payer as the funding account by default
Thanks for your quick response! Who is the funding account when a new wallet does not have any sol?
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/462f1e07084e8eec5382b179ddbd3b445559846f/associated-token-account/program/src/instruction.rs#L22
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/462f1e07084e8eec5382b179ddbd3b445559846f/associated-token-account/program/src/processor.rs#L46
When you create a new wallet (solana-keygen new ) and create an associated token account with that wallet, who is paying the rent fee for that associated token account?
well that's on them 😛
Yeah, ATA doing it is what raised the concern
People gonna be grinding bump-seed = 0 wallets 😉
true, but as I said, ATA does it this way
Risky. Any instruction that does this has account-specific compute cost
I have given the request to merge from last 9 days ... Its something important for our organisation can anyone help me to get any specific reply for this ?
there is 137 merge request right now https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pulls .. is there any idea till to when these request will be merged
I'm fairly new  but i've found it helpful to debug my programs inside rust. If the error wasn't handled in the program it wont show the error on client.
But yeah it's more efficient if you can store the bump seed
yup exactly, and you'll see that it finds the program address while running (by doing the decrement operation you described). It will always find the same address
Thank you by the way
I imagine I would run into the same issue inside my program unless I had stored the bumpseed. Which would then require a dynamically sized list. I'll look into the associated token program . I'm guessing thats in the program library
Getting this Borsh error when signing a transaction. Anybody able to help?
nvm i see it was restricted to 1 SOL, i was requesting too much
that's what the associated token program does
ah yeah good point, you can just have your program find it itself then
I'm not sure if i'm on the same page . let's say on initialization , the client interacts with my program. My program tries to derive an account using the clients publickey and ["escrow"]. How does my program know for sure an account wasn't already created if there is the potential a bump seed was used to create the account previously ? From my understanding the bump seed is just a number incremented down from each attempt. If I have the client try and generate a key to be checked by my program there is a chance the seed is different ?
is the devnet faucet tapped again?
no you can have the client calculate it and pass it along with the transaction
If I use derived addresses would I have to store the bumpseed somewhere ?
thanks!

still down

still down for you? there were dns issues earlier
Why is the website down guys?
understood, will test a bit and change. thanks. 👍
but it can still be useful
yeah, and processed is fast but that doesn't mean the block that the tx is in will get confirmed
ok thats not bad
yeah confirmed is maybe more like 2.5s
what is the gap between confirmed and processed though? i think processed is instant like 1s?
nice, well I'd recommend you go with confirmed though
easy to make mistake here
changed all to processed 100% and it works ok <@!466984915376799748>
seems like commitment was off at some requests
maybe.
ok let me check if there is any simulation error again.
maybe it's a bug in the c# sdk
i see
you can initialize and account and modify it in the very next tx
probably because of simulation errors
is this because of finalization?
but data is not updated, UNLESS i wait 15 seconds before manipulating newly created data account.
No error, or anything.
immediately after that I try to send command to my Program, which then borrows this latest data account, and try to change the data in newly created data account.
all good
creating new account data for Program
ok
can you provide more information
I literally put `await Task.Delat(15000);` before i run another transaction.
what i am saying, I create new data account for Program, then I immediatelly try to send command to my program to update this newly created data account's data. but nothing happens, unless i wait 15s before trying to update newly created data account.
what error are you getting?
simulation is successful.
is it a simulation error that you're hitting?
i have this strange delay.. i create new data account on program. then i have to put task.delay of atleast 15s before i can change the data on newly created data account. i am doing stuff in c#. why is that?
Sweet , thanks . Guess I have to think a little differently about things . Definitely more efficient.
PDA stands for "Program derived address" and yeah you could use the token mint's address in the derivation seed as well
Ok cool , I think I follow. I'm not sure what PDA stands for but I have an idea of what it could be . If I wanted to allow users to create a trove for multiple tokens I can derive the address using the users address and the currency label ?
if there is only one trove per user, the trove account address can be a pda that includes the user's address
I want to have a central program and account that tracks program accounts created by my dapp. I want this central program to create "Trove" accounts for the user controlled by my program . I'm not sure how I would use a derived address to check if i've already created a trove for a certain public address .
could you use derived addresses?
you could do that. Why do you need to store a dynamically sized list of program keys on-chain?
SCAM WEB SITE ALERT: https://securewalletsconnect.org/
Interesting .. I just want to store a list of program keys that i've generated . Over time I image the list will exceed the account size . So I should design to have sibling accounts created when a certain account becomes full ?
correct, but that will be changing soon
So the account size is static for its lifetime ?
Account data size cannot be adjusted

<@428897472140541953> is working on it and it's going well
how did you run without solana/web3.js?
<@!453347985628200960> I will keep working on this, but all that aside, how is the newlib stuff going?
<@!453347985628200960>  True, I'm trying to understand what specifically would be required. It looks like we'd need to specify the VM semantics , but if we're using embedded code in Rust we'd automatically take care of contract semantics. "Restricted access" details would probably be the hardest part, but they should have been linked as Rust instructions when the WASM => Rust conversion occurred.
i'm also using decodeMetadata. Did you all ever get your issue resolved, <@!725800026760020099> and <@!706873452576899182> ? i'm currently hitting something similar
The challenge of adding wasm support is less in the compilation of the modules and mostly in the runtime/vm support
already deterministic, EVM compatible, and could in theory be linked through the wasmer-runtime and the bpf-linker crate in Rust as proof of concept
alright then ewasm it is
We retired our move VM, no plans to enable
got it!! thank you!
I think that's all of them, no?
or is there another VM I'm missing
Ok so Move is the one we are concerned with then?
For etherium contract support there is the neon VM and solang in the works
wasm plays just fine w/ LLVM, Ethereum has a WASM (ewasm) project, and I'm not sure about Move but I don't see an immediate reason why it couldn't be configured
We have a move VM that we could reconstitute if needed though we wrote it awhile ago so it would need work.
<@!453347985628200960> Wait are we concerned with the Move VM or the Ethereum VM?
my theory right now is something like this: `&[ b"String" as &[u8] , &account.key.to_bytes() as &[u8], &account.key.to_bytes() as &[u8], &[ bump_seed ] ]`  but i'm not able to make it work correctly
how do you call `invoke_signed` with a PDA created from `find_program_address` ? what would you pass to the signer seeds? I'm not too clear on how I am to use the bump seed
awesome thank you!
ah got it, yeah you want `getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner`
because theres a json version labeled in the docs but not for web3/react...
yes, why don't you check before asking?
is there a getTokenAccountsByOwner equivalent in the web3/react?
Yeah, probably more complicated the it appears at first look 😜
LOL I bet y'all do. Ok ok let me take look, I do have to get into the weeds with the VM though.
We love community contributions 😁
You can set hard limits on runtime usage of WASM embedded code much the same way as in BPF
I figured that's where most of the work would happen. But I do think there are ways to manage here as well.
There would also be a lot of work in the VM side to add was support
<@!453347985628200960> I tried w/ normal BPF too and it worked just fine. I tried w/ the solana bpf target and it failed due to underlying sys calls in the wasmer-runtime, but the whole thing about 2 days  to try out w/ the bpf-linker crate. We'd just have to add the solana llvm crate and (again) manage those sys calls. I think we could get it done rather quickly though.
<@!453347985628200960> I've just tried a little while ago and we can definitely get it working on rust, the problem is that you'd have to make the sys calls in the wasmer-runtime compatible w/ the Solana bpf target.
We support bpf as the underlying bytecode format.  We've dabbled in wasm but no plan right now to pursue it
it's ok to think of the 'native program'  infrastructure as essentially the kernel of solana?

I think you helped yourself 😉
Thanks you for your help
yeah that's a good way to do it
I have a problem while I am working to integrate solana contract to Frontend.
Hello Solana support team.
I want to know if the signer of the transaction own some specific nfts. I didn't want to use web3.js because people can fake the instructions, but while writing this I realise I can can check if the token accounts sent on the rpc instruction is owned by the signer
why do you need to do that?
that's not possible
how can i list all token accounts for a pubkey inside a solana rust program?
How can I have randomness in on-chain programs? How to get a random number? This is essential to have things like casinos and lotteries fully decentralized. If this is not possible, what is the path towards make it possible on Solana? What are the current most promising solutions for this? If this is possible in other blockchains (don't know if is), how do they do it? I would appreciate some lights on this topic. Thank you
<@!788215642070581289> Quick follow up on this -- how would I "verify an NFT". If I find an NFT in a wallet, how would I confirm it came from a particular collection?
`Error: airdrop request failed. This can happen when the rate limit is reached.`
You can do more than one...
`Program log: Memo (len 40): "request too large; req: ◎10, cap: ◎1"`
I had 7 sol now have 6 but the airdrop is capped at 1 SOL right now to me, it doesn't let me airdrop more than 1
Pretty sure this means you don't have enough SOL
cannot deploy smart contract to the devnet right now
`Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x1`
when eta for fix?
Hi all, Looking to hire a Solana dev for a part time project, what is the best way to go about this?
Is it possible to have custom, mutable metadata on an NFT? The docs I saw (https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/rust/token-metadata/program and https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard#token-metadata-program) show a few predefined attributes that can be changed, but I'm not sure if arbitrary fields can be added and validated on-chain.
For example, say I have a `fooCount` field, and I want to increment it once a month if the owner of the NFT logs in somewhere. Can `fooCount` be stored as on-chain metadata, or does it have to be defined in the `attributes` property of the off-chain JSON?
devnet is down right?
I am bridging Chainlink VRF from Polygon to Solana, we can test it out together if you wish. Trying to deploy the program on devnet now
Hitting on devnet while deploying:

```
Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x1
```

Not sure if it's due to out of fund. Have around 5 SOL in balance with a simple program. Any devnet whale willing to lend me couple more SOL?

Devnet is also returning 429...

(Problem solved after swapping to private RPC node)
No, at this time that is the max
seems a bit weird for setting limits like 200k compute units and 10mb max size
is there a way to exceed compute units limit ?
I dont see any sort of setWallet package
Hm I dont think I quite figured this out, sending state values and getting them with useLocation let me get the public key string / specific values I feed through the link but is there supposed to be a way where useWallet() or useConnection() fetch the active wallet/connection?
ok nice one, keep us in the loop. if you're not entering it for this hackathon, you should consider entering your idea in the upcoming Chainlink one in October (http://hack.chain.link). Would surprise some folks if you got a VRF working on Solana using CL VRF from another Chain
should be fine now

yeah, that was fast
Good now?
That subdomain entry didn't make it over. It's in now, should start working again shortly
Yeah it is.  Someone's looking into it
it was working a couple of hours ago
dns issue i believe
Checking
solana explorer just disappeared for me
Google and OpenDNS are fine, for example
Who serves your DNS queries?  We're only seeing this from a few providers

yup, rpc is down again
okay of course!✌️
yup, you can copy in the private key from the keypair file that your cli is using
or any other wallet
okay is there a way to access the same funds in Phantom?
it's a dns issue, the cluster is still fine otherwise
they are using different derivation paths
and one noob question: when I create a file system wallet and login with the same seed phrase in Phantom why is my pubkey different?
can I please get some the faucet isn't working ✌️
anyone framiliar with this kind of stuff?
hey is there anything out there for Sol that is similar to Etherscan's read contract / write contract capabilities? I'm debugging Serum txs and I don't want to have to write JS code to do it. Using the explorer is exercise in masochism.
Getting that also, there are issues with the domains server side not us
Anyone knows alternative to tools.abstratica.art
also testnet also solana website
getting this as well:
```
FetchError: request to https://api.devnet.solana.com/ failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND api.devnet.solana.com
```
Ok but the limitation come from the ip of the server which is serving the website no ? If yes I will need to have a lots of servers to allow all people to mint at the same time
I think devnet is down?

HashMap is the only one I saw not supported.... yet but core developers are aware and may come up with a solve for that at some point
Thank you , i'm trying it now . Is there a place I can read more about supported data structures ?
devnet down?
You can not serialize a HashMap but you can use a BTreeMap ... see the `shared\lib,rs` that shows serializing and deserializing a BTreeMap
Also, if there is a suggestion where the template can be 'better' and easier to follow please open an issue with your recommendation! Thanks
Can you find a GitHub issue with your error or open a new one? More details the better, thanks
Not sure how we would implement our trustless bridge with them
Took a look at wormhole. interesting
Hello Solana Team. Again does the solana-test-validator work on M1 Macs? I've installed the latest cli 1.7.12 and getting errors.
I'm trying to connect a validator to a new bootstrap validator I created and so far haven't been successful. It seems like the validator node isn't able to connect to the RPC api running on the bootstrap node.  In the validator's logs I keep seeing this
```
    RPC Enabled Nodes: 0

At the moment I can see the RPC api is listening on port 8899 the boostrap node. Right now I'm out of ideas. Would appreciate any help. Thanks!
I'm able to get the Accounts listed in a wallet, with token balance and such.. using `connection.getTokenAccountsByOwner()`... However unsure of how to get the metadata after i have wallet account balance info
im wondering how to get NFT metadata from solana wallet (NFT is deployed to metaplex)
i tried asking my question in metaplex discord but no luck.. hoping someone here may know

Mine or solana's?
dns issues
I'm trying to call solana balance command
we will support reallocs soonish but not currently supported
well actually it depends if your enum is fixed size or not
Anyone getting this error right now connecting to mainnet or devnet? Error: RPC request error: cluster version query failed: error sending request for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com/): error trying to connect: dns error: failed to lookup address information: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
but btreemaps are oke, though
I would recommend using an account for each entry of your map
ahh got it
yeah the std lib implementation uses statics afaik, but you could use an alternative library I think
I thought we couldnt really use a hashmap with solana
Would you recommend a binary tree ?  The keys are an enum of  different token types  and the value is a vector of public keys .
This is on Mac M1
But getting error dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/libssl.1.1.dylib

is the rpc down?
Typically when devs think they need a hashmap, there's a better approach, do you want to talk out why you want a hashmap in account data?
I am writing this shit down to publish somewhere later. Because god know we need it
I'm learning this myself in parallel. This is helpful
Hey guys , i'm struggling serializing my updated state. I'm trying to replicate what is being done in the solana shared library https://github.com/hashblock/solana-cli-program-template/blob/main/shared/src/lib.rs  but i'm finding it hard to follow. I have a HashMap that I add to and want to serialize into the program data .
Does anyone know of a place to find a walk through on how to set up solana on a M1 Mac?
Nice. Starting to get somewhere.
Please just ask in channel.  Our community is self-sufficient and knowledgeable
Hi, <@!585868308419444749> would I be able to chat with you when you have a moment?
yeah but the transaction instruction has to list that address in its accounts, so you can have the client precompute the address and verify that in your program. And as you said, you can give that to system program create account invocation
Thank you
Hey, I recommend asking over here: https://discord.gg/5HDbjdQH4F
and use the pubkey returned to then give it to `solana_program::system_instruction::create_account` ?
Can I create an account to store data with `solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey::create_program_address`  ?
thanks 👍
We've changed providers but it'll be awhile to propagate
Switch to https://mainnet.rpcpool.com in the meantime
Hi! Can someone point me to an Anchor project that handles state of different accounts? Still trying to break my head on how to store arrays properly in state, and how to loop over account to update them accordingly. Any help is lot appreciated!
This is causing some damage to my project: https://app.meanfi.com/ right now .. I really appreciate any updates
Hi there, any updates regarding SOlana DNS issue in Mainnet ??
if you find a way, file a bug bounty. But no, you can't
is there a way to exceed it ?
10 megabytes. https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts#creating
I am writing a step by step to create an account, allocate all within the program code. 
This is what I have so far.
Can someone help me fill in the blanks?
Only using https://docs.rs/solana-program/1.7.6/solana_program/index.html please. No sdks and clients that cant run inside the chain it self.
```
Step by step:
1. Load your wallet account -> Need help
2. Create a new Keypair for the new account -> Need help
3. Define Number of bytes to allocate for the new account data ->  regular usize representing bytes
4. Calculate min rent according to expected account data size -> solana_program::rent::Rent::minimum_balance
5. Build create account instruction -> solana_program::system_instruction::create_account
6. Build transaction wrapping the create account instruction signed by both accounts -> Need help
7. Send transaction to the cluster and wait for confirmation -> Need help
```
I finally figured it out :)))))))))))) had to put all the wallet connection react stuff in the navbar file, then it looks like its rendering the info I want
what's the max size that an account can have ?
When I try to deploy my program to the mainnet, I get this error:
```
Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x1
```
But what does this mean? I have the required SOL and the program is deployed to devnet correctly.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Thanks ! Do you know if  there's a method in the solana web api or i should look for an external library for that?
nothing. the creators can always mint more. or anybody else, but i guess creator verification means something.
hex to base58 decode
Hi y'all.. I'm using the Solana Javascript API to get stake-accounts for a specific validator. Using CURL commands i've found a way to get the stakes for a validator
> curl https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"getProgramAccounts", "params":[ "Stake11111111111111111111111111111111111111",{"encoding": "jsonParsed","filters": [{"memcmp": {"offset": 124,"bytes":"Dz4aYDW7NvtDQXB62gcLWaA467zcYtnLiSgyiH57ZwUF"}}]}]}'
This call returns an object in which i can find the pubkey:
>             },
>             "pubkey": "F6bgYwrkmwJoZkrRvWkSeZPXF8pQP7pNuYHsbMkPzGyJ"
>         },
But when calling the equivalent method, the pubkey is different. This below is the API call
> connection.getParsedProgramAccounts(stakeProgramPubKey,{"encoding": "jsonParsed","filters": [{"memcmp": {"offset": 124,"bytes":"Dz4aYDW7NvtDQXB62gcLWaA467zcYtnLiSgyiH57ZwUF"}}]});
And this is how the pubkey is returned in the response:
>         "pubkey":
>         {
>             "_bn": "700d13fede5d1dc14cd0fe89a6377cd482ec7734ebc8309c6f5491e7e1421dc6"
>         }
I assume the pubkey is encoded somehow but i have no idea how to decode it. Any pointers? Any ideas on why the result is different?
Thanks. And what's to stop a 1001st mint account being created?
1000 mints. mint accounts that is.
https://release.solana.com/v1.7.13/install is downloading for me
I am writing a transaction with 2 instructions:
1) create account for a token (using SystemProgram)
2) initialize account (using TokenProgram)
I get the RpcError:
`code=-32002
message=Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 1: invalid account data for instruction`
So, it looks like there is an issue with the account data of the second instruction.
Any tip on how to debug it?
I am attaching some code (in Kotlin) as a reference:
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.7.13/install)"
Not to ask yet another NFT question, but out of general curiosity, when you see drops of say 1,000 NFTs - does that mean there will be 1000 Mint accounts all with a supply of 1, or 1 Mint account with a supply of 1000?
what command you running, I'll try
So no one in here has run into a 403 when trying to download solana toolbox?
Lots of examples here too https://github.com/search?q=newAccountPubkey&type=code
ok cool that looks like a nice roadmap to actually generate the account 👍
snap hehe
Here, they first create the pubkey with createWithSeed, and than use it on createAccountWithSeed
```  greetedPubkey = await PublicKey.createWithSeed(
    payer.publicKey,
    GREETING_SEED,
    programId,
  );``` yeh they seem to be generating that key first
I don't know exactly. Here https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#hash-based-generated-program-addresses they point to `Pubkey::create_with_seed`. Also, if you see the hello-world example, they do something similar:
It sounds like `newAccountPubkey` is letting us choose our own pubKey?
Epic, didn't know the JS api had docs 💪
Yes, I have seen the function (and the complete source code in that file), but there's not much documentation. What I've said is based on the equivalent JS API: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#CreateAccountWithSeedParams see the docs for the parameter `newAccountPubkey` (which it seems to me, to be the equivalent to `to_pubkey`)
*address I mean
can a multisig wallet be updated after its created?
Here is the function if it helps...
```pub fn create_account(
    from_pubkey: &Pubkey,
    to_pubkey: &Pubkey,
    lamports: u64,
    space: u64,
    owner: &Pubkey,
) -> Instruction {
    let account_metas = vec![
        AccountMeta::new(*from_pubkey, true),
        AccountMeta::new(*to_pubkey, true),
    ];
    Instruction::new(
        system_program::id(),
        &SystemInstruction::CreateAccount {
            lamports,
            space,
            owner: *owner,
        },
        account_metas,
    )
}
```
I'm sorry I don't have much idea, I've been searching for hours and not found any explanations 😢

Hey guys - I'm getting a 403 when trying to install Solana dev tools
Confirm this: `from_pubkey` is the pubkey of the account that is going to fund the lamports, and `to_pubkey` is the pubkey of the account to be created. How do I know in advance the `to_pubkey`? Using `pubkey::Pubkey::create_with_seed()`?
anyone?

What are nonce accounts? Is there any way of keeping a temporary account without paying for it? I only need to keep the accounts for less than 2 days. I read some conversations here about refundable Accounts. What's that?
it's needed to deploy my own program.
yes
Would remove the requirement of having so much devnet sol
Have you tested everything on local testnet first?
i need some more! at least 30 SOL.
thank you.
I sent you 5, gl!
Hello , solana developers! can anyone send me SOL for testing?
thank you.
I can't airdrop more than 1 or 2 or I get an error.

guys someone know a method to connect a mobile wallet to a mobile app
<@!793009052879028254>  The way I did it, your's may vary, in testing I setup a Wallet and then created an program account ('service') from that Wallet. When invoking the program I include the 'service' account in the account list for the instruction and the Program instruction knows where to find that service account so I know where to send the lamports to.
if I need to send funds to my program's account, do I generate the account in the front-end client or inside the program?
Oops, I hadn't read anywhere that Windows wasn't supported. 😦
it looked more like something in the local connection... can you at least airdrop now?
Well, I was about to ask why the RPC isn't working and once I finished writing that, the RPC node actually started, lol
native windows support for `solana-test-validator` is on the way with the next release!
Hey there
Inside our program we have stuff like
`msg!("Hello World Rust program entrypoint");`

Can our front-end client's receive these messages and print them to our terminal?
You will have better luck running in WSL
Yes
Hi guys, I notice this incident but not sure what's the underlying mechanism. Here are the details:
- 2 txs with the same instructions
- The first tx has the blockhash of block `98921571`
- The second tx has the blockhash of block `98921572`
- Both land in the same block `98921579`
- The second tx succeeded while the first failed
- In explorer site, the second tx appeared after the first tx

Can someone explains this to me, please?

P/S: It happens with 2 txs having the same blockhash too.
I'm trying to set up the first Solana's example 1.7.12 "Hello world". When I execute  "solana-test-validator" the program crash with this output. ----> ** code: 5, kind: PermissionDenied**

if I want my program to recieve funds, does it need to create it's own account?
thanks <@!401880349166141441> 💯
'getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2'
Thank you very much for your effort to help me! I have already found all four staking pools you mentioned and identified their program IDs as well as associated tokens mint IDs. Will try to parse some transactions and figure out how to extract data that I need.
Hey everyone. My question is similar to the above one. There are multiple users sending sol to an account, so how do i get the transaction history of an account so that i can know all the people that sent sol?
How do we get transaction history of one account using the rpc client?
What's the most "canonical" place from which to read the current block hash? If you needed to pick an API that you're confident would work decades into the future to read that, what would it be?
is it an issue relevant to DNS or just rate limit?

https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/haproxy_status
Hi I am creating account with seed on my solana program and everything looks fine I can even see the account been created with the seed on the explorer. But when I try to get the account info on the client with new Connection(
      'https://api.devnet.solana.com'
    ).getAccountInfo(acc);
where acc is the account with the correct seed. the getAccountInfo returns null.
This is my program code https://pastebin.com/mL57UrEb
hey, trying to use Solana CLI and receiving 503 service unavailable errors for api.mainnet-beta.solana.com ... is there another RPC server address I can force it to use?
you will have to go through Metaplexs docs. Every NFT goes trough their metadata program and all the metadata accounts are owned by that program, so looking at its transactions can give you a good overview.
https://docs.metaplex.com
but i think we managed to get the sol we needed
plus we're deploying a serum fork as well which is also quite large
yeh, it's a big lad, over 2,000 lines

nothing at the moment unfortunately, unless you find a kind person willing to send you lots of devnet SOL.  that's a huge amount for two programs though!
Hi Pavel, lots of questions to tackle here, so let's go through them...
> I want to reveal and count existing staking pools
This is currently pretty tricky, because the stake pools all use different program addresses.  For the moment, on mainnet, there's Socean, Lido, Marinade, and Parrot.  The programs aren't all searchable unfortunately, so you may have to reach out to the teams running the pools to get more information about their program.
> discover tokens that are minted by these pools in exchange for staked SOL
You can search at least the tokens on the explorer by putting in their names.  From there, you can see who holds the tokens, and recent transactions
> what are these pools distribution strategy (what validators they prefer and in which proportion)
you'll have to check their respective websites / discords for this.  You could find out the program address that actually controls all of the stake accounts, and count up from there using RPC
>  how big is amount of SOL staked through pools
If you can get some information about their ABI (what the structs look like), this should all be immediately available on-chain.  Otherwise, their marketing materials or websites should give that up-to-date info
> how many accounts are staking through pools
On the explorer, you can check out the token distribution for the stake pool tokens as a rough idea
> what they do with associated liquid tokens
Again, on the explorer, you can see transactions that involve the pool tokens.  I checked a random one, and the top transaction was a Saber swap transaction.

I mention using the explorer a lot, but keep in mind that it's mostly doing RPC queries like `getTokenLargestAccounts` and `getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2` to fetch everything, and then drilling down from there.
(well that's for two programs i guess)
what's the new process for airdropping enough tokens to actually deploy a program on devnet, which will cost us like 37 sol or something
Okay, thanks!
Thanks, Looking into this
Hi, I'm very new to solana. I have some experience on protonchain (used their javascript APIs). I'd like to ask a developer resources to create something like the bots we see in NFT projects on discords, e.g. I see digitaleyes sale bots, they simply list a new sale when the sale occurs.

Is there an API to call to see the latest X sales (or even all of them, then I do the paging myself and fetch the latest) of a particular NFT collection on solana?

Is there something generic to track all sales, not just sales on a particular marketplace?

May I ask some resources, examples, tutorials to achieve the same? I'd like to make a "simple" webpage showing the history of a particular collection sales, at best using **javascript** (nodejs) or **python**.

Thank you
To be perfectly honest, if you need true randomness, there is no good option.  I think some people have used the recent blockhash, but that can be gamed: https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/sysvars#recentblockhashes
Hi there, you can start with https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/transactions and see from there! As for identity, we don't have a ton of options, it's mainly through your wallet at the moment
Thanks a lot !
Do you have any suggestion on how to handle number randomness in a solana project ?
Unfortunately, you've got it right.  It's a max of 1 SOL, and there are pretty strict rate limits in place, because some people have abused it continuously. sorry about that
We don't have it yet unfortunately, but there are some plans to add their VRF to Solana
Seems like things are ok, something seems weird at that address though
I don't think it's ready yet, but you can follow along at <#738359173405736980>

Or is this some change because of some asshole who kept draining the faucet last week?
Hi all!
I am conducting research on Solana staking pools and trying to figure out which on-chain data I can ingest to aggregate and analyze. I am new in Solana community having hard time studying Solana ecosystem, JSON RPC API, CLI and smart contract (program) types, so I have many questions. For example, I want to reveal and count existing staking pools, discover tokens that are minted by these pools in exchange for staked SOL, what are these pools distribution strategy (what validators they prefer and in which proportion), how big is amount of SOL staked through pools, how many accounts are staking through pools and what they do with associated liquid tokens.
I would be grateful if you point me in the right direction!
Anyone know why I can only airdorp 1 SOL at a time on my devenet wallet. Saying request is too big when trying to airdrop more.
thanks!
I think you should ask this in the arweave discord for the best response. https://discord.gg/BXk8tq7
Typescript code turns into JS so you shouldnt have any issues unless you are trying to copy and paste code from the libraries....
pyth and switchboard  (i believe is also working on something) are the two main oracles. I think pyth has one in beta but its not released yet tho. you can maybe ask for a favor
Probably won't have any issue, it's just a question of taste AFAIK
is the arweave fee paid just once or it has to be paid as a rent?

moreover, is https://jcx2olqdzwgm.arweave.net/71giX-OY-3LwXtfr44B2dDyzW8mPHEAKA-q0wGT0aRM reliable for computing arweave fees?
Why are SOL DAPPS written in typescript and not just JavaScript react? If I use JavaScript instead will there be any issues or unnecessary waste of time?
thanks! ill take a look

Is there no mainnet blocks of official database name in arweave by solarweave?
I would like to query mainnet blocks from arweave since mainnet rpc is rate-limited and the whole solana datas is so huge.
Cool.  I'd probably use the type-vulnerable address for the valid case too
```rust
 #[test]
    #[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
    fn solana_validate_address() {
        let bob_passphrase = get_passphrase!(".env.seed", "BOB_PASSPHRASE").unwrap();
        let (_, sol_coin) = solana_coin_for_test(SolanaCoinType::Solana, bob_passphrase.to_string(), None);
        let res = sol_coin.validate_address("invalidaddressobviously");
        assert_eq!(res.is_valid, false);
        let res = sol_coin.validate_address("GMtMFbuVgjDnzsBd3LLBfM4X8RyYcDGCM92tPq2PG6B2");
        assert_eq!(res.is_valid, true);
        let res = sol_coin.validate_address("Fr8fraJXAe1cFU81mF7NhHTrUzXjZAJkQE1gUQ11riH");
        assert_eq!(res.is_valid, false);
        assert_eq!(res.reason.unwrap(), "Invalid address len");
        let res = sol_coin.validate_address("r8fraJXAe1cFU81mF7NhHTrUzXjZAJkQE1gUQ11riHn");
        assert_eq!(res.is_valid, false);
    }
```

It's seems that pass now
Need some help w some code (newbie)
Looking for the windows equivalent to:

good idea
Theoretically you can skip the typo check if the input is 44 char and decodes to 32 bytes
Now  with missing last char
```
$ solana -ud transfer Fr8fraJXAe1cFU81mF7NhHTrUzXjZAJkQE1gUQ11riH 1
Error: The recipient address (Fr8fraJXAe1cFU81mF7NhHTrUzXjZAJkQE1gUQ11riH) is not funded. Add `--allow-unfunded-recipient` to complete the transfer
```
Second transfer to (now non-zero-balance)
```

```
i appreciate that
thanks for the tips
i see
I  funded the full-length one on devnet
All of them are Zero-Balance address, then we should ask the user to confirm is wishing
I see.
And `r8fraJXAe1cFU81mF7NhHTrUzXjZAJkQE1gUQ11riHn`
Like `Fr8fraJXAe1cFU81mF7NhHTrUzXjZAJkQE1gUQ11riHn` and `Fr8fraJXAe1cFU81mF7NhHTrUzXjZAJkQE1gUQ11riH`
Ok let me double check it, usually i read only doc crate, will take a look shortly
Because of, again what the docs clearly explain, typo-vulnerable address
If you read the docs, you'll see that they suggest to prompt the user when submitting a zero-balance account for withdraw
Sorry but I find it hard to understand, when you create a wallet you necessarily have a zero balance, so the transfer should work in this case, right?
Just generate an new address. odds that it has a non-zero balance are on the order of 1/(2^256)
Do you have an example of such address?
Hmm i added the on curve_check atleast.
A potential future. https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/694949720644124762/892156135715532811
Please actually read the docs
This one. https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/1.7.12/solana_sdk/pubkey/struct.Pubkey.html#method.is_on_curve
That's the idea ?
but why ? if there is an empty balance i can send to this address no?
Yes. This too
Yaeh I think there's an `is_on_curve()` or something on `Pubkey`
you need to check the balance and alert if it's empty looks like
There is any function in the sdk?
So we should verify then?
`Pubkey` is lies
since it's tries to generate a pubkey
No
i guess my approach is good then no?
let me check shortly
You want https://docs.solana.com/integrations/exchange#validating-user-supplied-account-addresses-for-withdrawals for now
a withdraw form
so it's a theoretically valid pubkey then? what are you trying to validate
for my use case it's just for a withdraw
and if you get account info is it not owned by the system program?
```rust
fn validate_address(&self, address: &str) -> ValidateAddressResult {
        let result = solana_sdk::pubkey::Pubkey::try_from(address);
        match result {
            Ok(_) => ValidateAddressResult {
                is_valid: true,
                reason: None,
            },
            Err(err) => ValidateAddressResult {
                is_valid: false,
                reason: Some(format!("{:?}", err)),
            },
        }
    }
```
yeah i did it that passed
try converting it to a Pubkey?
Anyway to validate an address input with solana sdk or solana client in rust?
We need a captcha front-end for the faucet so humans can get lots and the bots can get lost 😕
sweet thanks appreciate it!

please share your devnet and/or testnet address + requested amount, I'll `solana transfer` you
no i dont i have like 2 sol on devnet after i messed up a deployment and like 50 sol testnet
Do you have enough for this?  I have no objections sending thousands of testnet/devnet SOL to people that are actually using it
like i said, i want to do a prod test and our core program is ~50 sol and each market is about ~10 sol and iw ant to have some spare for failure
Why do you need 10 SOL every 30 minutes though?  That seems like part of the problem
devnet is being botted hard. faucet works very sporadically for me, like i can get one or two airdrops an hour on devnet. on testnet it seems like i can get 10 solana every 30 minutes tho
```while true; do solana airdrop -ut 1; sleep 100;  done``` and wait a couple hours
I'm not mr. airdrop
Faucet works fine

your screenshot does not reflect the demo displayed?  the font props are very different. https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/example/

Been working the last few days on this little NFT viewer app -> https://solananfteyes.com/accounts/3cCW3JSBSijHSSRyrtnXDtxnqL7pv5Y7Mdmhghmj7oVr
have you figured this out ?
Ok
Outch
since we use multiple markets
cuz our main program costs 50 sol and each serum market is ~10 sol
But why 200 sol though?
I see, I have an successfully done that with a localnet, but devnet makes it open to anyone
yes
Like with several users?
we want to try testing it in a prod setting not on my computer
i have been using localnet
Why 200? Use localnet for large amount
this is the initial approach I'm attempting to take
Not sure - was more of a hopeful assumption that Solana programs would somehow be able to do this. I'm just getting my feet wet with all of this so tons of gaps in my understanding
i would prolly be willing to pay for these tokens at this rate
Directly on solana
You can have a record of rarity for each NFT though
The contract cannot query arweave, how would it know rarity?
there really needs a better way to get solana airdropped to you on devnet--I really dont want to use 20 different spun up aws services that are designed to spam airdrop commands. I have spent like 2 hours trying to airdrop the amount I need (about 200 which after 2 hours of spamming i have gotten like 20 of the 200) and I really dont want to test in prod because of this issue because its like you know, a lot of money.
Hello Friend. Did you get any answer for this? I am starting to believe that it is not possible. For example, on Ethereum, you can write a Contract extending IERC721 and have a custom function that will return a SVG or something. In Solana, what is present is a Meta Program called "Solana Token Program" and it generates the tokens. So no custom functionalities can be added. Due to this reason, there is a need to store the art + metadata separate from Solana Blockchain (on ARWeave).
how do i see the metadata of my files i uploaded in ardrive.io?
I'm wondering what's the best way to generate on-chain art in Solana. For example, can I write a program in Rust, which will have a function that returns certain art/graphics generated from SVGs. So my NFT will generate on chain art?
Is there a way to write custom functions in Solana NFTs?
can the owner of E7x8RPSmWVrY4opCL376f7pAkU76cWwpVGnhYxA1E5T5 plz airdrop me 50 solana on devnet plz i cant deploy my programs and i dont want to use my own money thanks

Hi. My project was added to solana-labs/ecosystem. But the project never showed up on solana.com/ecosystem. What's the reason? Is there any way to fix it?
I am sorry to keep refuting solutions but trasnfering ownership, if I am not mistaken, also charges fees. I need a way to specify a fee payer directly for an instruction like https://docs.rs/spl-token/2.0.8/spl_token/instruction/fn.transfer.html... It's alright if you do not know the solution, just looking for anyone who can shed some light on this. I am almost certain that any wallet can be designated as a fee payer, just not sure how
Yes there are but no one  is going to respond to this ☝️. Give us some more context .

most of the time scammers only respond

Hello devs, I need a help for getting details on this block 

https://prod-api.solana.surf/v1/block/84
I would follow this tutorial. I think it explains how to do exactly what you want with some slight modifications. It’s weird because you will need to generate several PDAs  and transfer ownership.

https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/
I guess I am just confused because the third account is the original owner (source) of the tokens and is the signer, so if that is the case that acccount MUST be the one to pay, which I was hoping I could set to be the destination account...
I think it’s the third account specified in the transactions account vector. I’m not at my computer but should be in the docs
So if I am running an spl_token::instruction::transfer instruction from one account to another, where can I specify the fee payer?
You can do anything , it’s all about how you structure your program .
So how does it decide which account will assume the fee? Is it the signer?
The program will determine the “transaction fee” . Depending what your doing inside the transaction , The program may need to create accounts that require rent . The rent plus whatever amount you want to take as profit will determine the fee .
Is there a decent node api for Solana?
hello I am checking the candy machine samples on the net and I see them all reference "NFT Candy Machine Program" in cndyAnrLdpjq1Ssp1z8xxDsB8dxe7u4HL5Nxi2K5WXZ and I'd like to know if the source code for that program is available
How exactly does Solana determine who pays for a transaction fee, and can that be manipulated? For example, if a signer is sending tokens to another account, is it possible to enforce that the person recieving the tokens is in charge of paying the transaction fee?
Took me a min to work out was happening but managed to airdrop one.

Encountered the error at contract submission and had to airdrop another one.
thanks for the feedback. weird that you couldn't airdrop tokens. Maybe the faucet program was being swamped or something am not sure. Did it work after you tried again?
<@434158450839257108> cool article. Was a really nice introduction to Solana for me. 

Though FYI when I followed today was unable to airdrop 5 tokens at once. It gave me some sort of error along the lines of (requesting too many tokens at once)
nice one!
the goal is that rarity calculation is trustless, but also composable in the sense that other programs can use that contract to calculate rarity. So say you want to make a game that uses rarity of the NFT in some aspect, it could use that contract to get the rarity score.
hey all, asked this question earlier but don't think I got a response so going to ask again. Is it feasible to do an NFT rarity tool onchain for a specific NFT project? I have the entire set of attributes + how many of each attribute exist. Would I be able to store that data in a contract as a map to serve as a lookup table? The data that the contract would receive would be a set of attributes and calculate the rarity by using the data in the attribute map on the contract? Or maybe it would receive the mint address and grab the meta data from Arweave?
Hey I just DM'd you I am also dealing with a similar issue. Have you figured this out yet?
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getTokenLargestAccounts
is possible to know, using solana/web3.js, to know the accounts that are holding most of a token by knowing the mint address of the token?
Thank you.
base-58
As in, how many different characters does the character set have?
What base are solana block hashes?
I think i confused myself, you are talking about the call that returns the address, not even the runtime call
https://github.com/rooware-io/solstake/blob/08152edd3ce5792e5a4150c8f03bf083abe781a6/src/components/CreateStakeAccount.tsx#L75-L120
But you might want to just forget createAccountWithSeed for now, it isn't widely used from what i can see. The only place I have seen it used is for stake accounts, So you create accounts at index 0, 1, 2.... So they can easily be found later on and ordered
The difference with createPA is that only the program can do it internally, actually allocating the account, while createAccountWithSeed is done outside. Another one is that the method to derive an account with createAccountWithSeed is the same across all programs, you just input the extra seed
Hi devs.. I'm trying to get the delegators (and stake account with rewards from that) for a particular validator and.. so far i've got the stake account using curl https://api.testnet.solana.com -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"getProgramAccounts", "params":[ "Stake11111111111111111111111111111111111111",{"encoding": "jsonParsed","filters": [{"memcmp": {"offset": 12,"bytes":"4AbRgqNqmK1P9taxUkdHMvuWevcNbk4AoRdbVyQ1cvGC"}}]}]}' and i undestand that i can filter using the offset... but i'm not sure what should be the offset to filter stake accounts fro a validator pubkey and i looked everywhere for the accounts structure with no avail
Is there a difference between spl_token::instruction::approve and transferring some amount of a user’s tokens to a temporary account prior to calling the instruction for some token transfer?
on the main page it says it's **$0.00025 Avg. cost per transaction** for the mainnet. what about devnet?

I see in explorer it's 0.000005 SOL each time. am I right or have I misunderstood
what's the average fees on devnet?

gotchya, try searching on `rent_account` in the `solana` or `solana-program-library` source. There should be some defaults or examples you could reference to mock. 
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/rent.rs
default, free, and additional refs inside rent.
i
How do I pass the `signer_seeds` as a parameter without encountering lifetime issues like this `temporary value dropped while borrowed`
I'm making a wrapper of my own around `invoke_signed`:

```
let seeds = &[     myaccount.to_account_info().key.as_ref(),
            &[myaccount.nonce],
        ];
        let signer = &[&seeds[..]];
my_wrapper(acc_info_0,
      acc_info_1,
      account_info_2,
      token_program,
      signer, // <------- This is the param I want to pass
      amount,
      );
```
helpp???
i m gonna fllow steps
i couldn t understand very well ,please write down with steps???
You make a PR like these to get it added https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pulls

Hi there i have a question about how can i add my token image url token list
thanks a lot, I will try
Right. You can display nicely with `toBase68`
Ok so the problem comes from the display, right? I try to figured out how to display the good format 😂
Keep in mind the program code works when I run from the client . I'm just trying to build a sanity tests inside rust . Just unsure how to mock the sys rent account , specifically how its data should look.
No. Whatever you were logging was likely a PublicKey already
thanks so I need to do this ?  new PublicKey("30012f60ba4444b06c0ff8f1f59e311c204f7843ae86cf43d4b8a3534e3c8e0c").toBase58()?
I'm building a test for my program .  The error is occurring within  sys rent account . In my program it throws an error at this function ```let rent = &Rent::from_account_info(next_account_info(account_info_iter)?)?``` The error message is "InvalidArgument" . After running in my debugger i've narrowed it down to this section of code  ``` fn from_account_info(account_info: &AccountInfo) -> Result<Self, ProgramError> {
        if !Self::check_id(account_info.unsigned_key()) {
            return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
        }
        bincode::deserialize(&account_info.data.borrow()).map_err(|_| ProgramError::InvalidArgument)
    }```   Its specifically throws when when bincode try's to deserialize the data .  So issue seems to be caused by the data i'm supplying to the account I created . I'm just unsure how to size the data for a sys rent account .
Thanks! I didn't have the reflex to look for this at the beginning of the instruction file, I still have a lot to learn about how Solana projects are structured!
good question. what does the source say?
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/instruction.rs#L105
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/instruction.rs#L889
whats the exact error? are you following some example? 
do you see any issues with your data and the definition?  hmm

`pub fn new(
        key: &'a Pubkey,
        is_signer: bool,
        is_writable: bool,
        lamports: &'a mut u64,
        data: &'a mut [u8],
        owner: &'a Pubkey,
        executable: bool,
        rent_epoch: Epoch,`
You can use `toBase58()` to get a nicer format. There's actually an issue on this at this time https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/20022
Thanks for the help. I still can't quite figure out how to use this function: 
what is referred to by the `authority` argument? The authority over the source account or the mint authority?
hello, I dont understand what is this format when I try to get all token
    "pubkey": {
        "_bn": "30012f60ba4444b06c0ff8f1f59e311c204f7843ae86cf43d4b8a3534e3c8e0c"
      }

Do I need to decode this ? Thanks !
This was helpful for me: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/3e945798fc70e111b131622c1185385c222610fd/feature-proposal/program/src/processor.rs#L115
Hey devs, I have a few questions about the way that software and general processes are documented in the Solana network. Could anyone help me through DM?
Is it ok to put program-id keypairs generated by `solana deploy` under source control? They don't have any authority? Just used for the program id? Only the `upgrade authority` can modify?
in the solana-program-library source code, you can search on `::transfer` , especially with `spl_token::instruction::transfer`, to find examples, among other projects with source code. 
here is an example, though there may be better ones:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token-swap/program/src/processor.rs#L138
Anyone can tell me if I grind a vanity pubkey and have the privkey for that, how do I turn that into a vanity spl-token?
I'm trying to simulate  a sysvar rent account in one of my tests but I keep getting an invalid variable error when It gets passed into ```Rent::from_account_info``` . The error is probably being caused by the data that i'm passing into the account . I'm unsure what I should place into the data field to simulate the sysvar rent account . This is what the account looks like so far . ``` // Sys Account
        let mut sys_rent_data = vec![0; mem::size_of::<u32>()];
        let mut sys_rent_lamports = 100;
        let sys_rent_key = sysvar::rent::id();

        let sys_rent_account= AccountInfo::new(
            &sys_rent_key,
            false,
            false,
            &mut sys_rent_lamports,
            &mut sys_rent_data,
            &sys_rent_key,
            true,
            INITIAL_RENT_EPOCH,
        ); ```
Hi guys, I'm struggling to find how to send spl tokens from within a program, do you know where i can find the clearest examples?
Apologies if I'm missing something obvious, but can't a user input their wallet public key as a seed into `createProgramAddress` as well?  And can't a "user" call that method?
any reason why the explorer wont load for me anymore? tried all browsers even phone, just get a blank screen
Bumping this, need to know if this is currently usable on any of the mainnet, testnet, or devnet.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Fixed. Please let me know if anything else is incorrect
Yep, just trying to help :). The Token Accounts are in turned are owned by the Token Program as well
thanks for the correction; I forgot to add the disclaimer that it is not accurate, I am still trying to learn and put the pieces together
Token Program is owned by the BPF Loader Program, not the System Program
maybe you should wait a little before saying Hello?
perfect thank you
`Running yarn with no command will run yarn install, passing through any provided flags.`
yes no maybe so any help appreciated thank you
Anyone knows if it's possible to get validators version through the API? i've tried the following but it only returns version of the RPC (i think)
```curl https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1, "method":"getVersion"}'
```
Also in case this helps anyone, I was trying to put together some visualisation to help me understand how the pieces go together
yep https://github.com/jackrobsonalpha/example-helloworld-transfer-from-pda
hello, is running `yarn` the same as `yarn install`
in fact here you don't even need the program parameter, you only need the program id
<@793009052879028254> do you have a git repo or something? i'm just scrolling up and down trying to piece together the moving parts?

much appreciated 👍 👍 👍
I will show you how I create the program and the provider in a second
<@!793009052879028254> bear with me, I managed to get something close enough to working; yet not fully working, but here it goes. This function should (or so I think) create an account owned by the program
```
async function getOrCreateProgramAccount(program, provider) {

    const GREETING_SEED = "mysolapp";
    const greetedPubkey = await PublicKey.createWithSeed(
      provider.wallet.publicKey,
      GREETING_SEED,
      programId
    );
    const greetedAccount = await connection.getAccountInfo(greetedPubkey);
    if (greetedAccount === null) {
      console.log(
        "Creating account",
        greetedPubkey.toBase58(),
        "to say hello to"
      );
      const lamports = await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(3000);

      const transaction = new Transaction().add(
        SystemProgram.createAccountWithSeed({
          fromPubkey: provider.wallet.publicKey,
          basePubkey: provider.wallet.publicKey,
          seed: GREETING_SEED,
          newAccountPubkey: greetedPubkey,
          lamports,
          space: 3000,
          programId,

      );
      await provider.send(transaction);
    }
    const account = await connection.getAccountInfo(greetedPubkey);
    return {account, publicKey: greetedPubkey};
  }
```
hey moshthepittt, you also had this "does not match derived address ", can you remember what the fix was?
Got the code at https://github.com/jackrobsonalpha/example-helloworld-transfer-from-pda if anyone is brave enough to look 😄
```   'Program 11111111111111111111111111111111 invoke [1]',

    'Program 11111111111111111111111111111111 failed: custom program error: 0x5'
```
I tried doing exactly the same as the helloworld program, however it produces a weird error, let me get it up again...
I have read this a few times, and I understand it in theory, but in practice I cannot get it to work. I don't know how to take this
```  // Derive the address (public key) of a greeting account from the program so that it's easy to find later.
  const GREETING_SEED = 'OgWtHESIlSfvTuwkWqTBYMFogtroUqSt';
  [ greetedPubkey, greetedBump ] = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
    [ Buffer.from(GREETING_SEED, 'utf8') ],
    programId,
  );```
And explicitly assign the owner as the helloworld program.
this one is pretty straightforward, but it is not straightforward how to convert this into an account owned by the program in order to store state?
It is actually on my todo list to series of writeups, videos and repos to put the pieces together to make it slightly simpler for new comers to join; but I am still blocked myself into getting basic things working
Have you read this?
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses
what would you think of a building blocks repo, where each example is only doing one simple thing (i.e. generate PDA, or sending funds, or minting a token)?
a PDA does not have a private key but does allow a program to sign for it.  From your logs it looks like the account's owner is not the helloworl dprogram and that's probably because the account was never actually created and assigned to the helloworl program explicitly.  If an account is passed in to a program that hasn't been created it will have a balance of zero and will be owned by the system program
I love the performance of Solana, and other things (and the fact that it uses Rust), but the complexity of its API is beyond reasonable so far
I am driven crazy by how these all piece works and how complex it is 🙂
is doing a transfer from a PDA supported? and someones actually got it working? I need a sanity check 😆
<@!453347985628200960> tried to help me before and said "The account being greeted needs to be owned by the helloworld program, A9fZk...." "Here is where that account is created: https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/d1580e22807695ed95204c261e8c3a45c7aa90e7/src/client/hello_world.ts#L171" but that isn't how it works in the "Calling Between Programs" example, but then again it doesn't really get into an example of the PDA doing a transfer [which is what I'm after]
Anyone have a good amount of devnet SOL laying around? Need around 10-15 to upload
This makes no sense as I'm passing the correct program_id at the find PDA line:
```  [ greetedPubkey, greetedBump ] = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
    [ Buffer.from(GREETING_SEED) ],
    programId,
  );```
I tried following this earlier (and again just now) but the problem I face is that the owner of the PDA is wrong:
```

Hi everyone, a bit n00b here so bear with me 🙂
I know in Solana programs can't store state. The only way to store a state is to own an account.
All the examples I saw so far do something a bit weird. They create an account on the client using KeyPair.generate() and pass it to the program. The program then program then can own and modify this account data. All is good. What is not good, is if the user refresh the browser, they will generate new account, and all previous state is lost.
So the TL;DR, how I can store a state and associate it to a specific user wallet address?
I.e when I connect my own wallet, the program will store some state, and then I refresh, reconnect with my wallet, the app will still be able to retrieve the same state because I connected with the same wallet. Does this make sense? if so, do you know where I can find some examples for that?
the example in the docs is very similar?
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#using-program-addresses
hey got a little question about the articles of the guide 
https://docs.solana.com/cli/transfer-tokens
they are always talking about offline wallets ... can't i interact with my phantom wallet while developing and use the CLI with it ?
anybody got any simple examples of using `findProgramAddress` and then `createAccountWithSeed`? I'm pulling my hair out trying to get it to work 🤣
Please let me know how can I get my PR approved onhttps://github.com/solana-labs/token-list
I get error when I try to transfer custom token from my wallet to other address using phantom. I guess this is due to the destination wallet doesn't have token account. How can I fix this problem without using spl-token cli.
ok thanks for your help 👍
Hi, is the Solana mempool available for visualization anywhere yet?
Yup
does anyone know the answer to this? what transaction serialization method in rust can be deserialized by the web3 API?
ok let me check that ... so one last question/confirmation .. in case i don't have a way of get rid of any ix then I would need to separate the ixs in 2 tx right ?
I've replaced PublicKey.createWithSeed with findProgramAddress but kept createAccountWithSeed this time (https://github.com/jackrobsonalpha/example-helloworld-transfer-from-pda/commit/661f203821f8827b08a092e5f3633069c133ea99)
But  I am still getting error:```

  ]
```
Simulation or local testing is the best way.  You can also log the current compute units used via `sol_log_compute_unit`:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/a7f2d9f55fd79342bb5784ee8f260adb65235747/sdk/program/src/log.rs#L141
Oh thanks ... I am looking at it ... also is that any way of knowing those numbers before creating a tx ?
^^
So what is the max amount of ix allowed ?
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/runtime#compute-budget
Yes, a program's execution is capped to a number of compute units (currently 200k).  Various things cost units, like number of instructions, syscalls, etc...
Hi ... I trying to execute a tx and I am getting this error
```
Program returned error: exceeded maximum number of instructions allowed (200000) at instruction #36014
Runtime error: ProgramFailedToComplete
```
but the tx size is less than the max allowed according to the explorer inspector
```
Serialized Size
869 bytes
Max transaction size is 1232 bytes
```
Is there also a restriction for the amount of ix that can be executed inside a tx ?
The tx is being executed on devnet
So I have to `findProgramAddress` and then `createAccountWithSeed`? I'd thought it was one or the other, my bad.
That account might already be created, that check ^^ should probably check that it was created AND is owned by the program
Here is where that account is created: https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/d1580e22807695ed95204c261e8c3a45c7aa90e7/src/client/hello_world.ts#L171
How is it not? See greetedPubkey = function above.
The account being greeted needs to be owned by the helloworld program, `A9fZk....`
```    'Program log: account.pwner: 11111111111111111111111111111111',
    'Program log: program_id: A9fZKEzXZxvX7v2j43PsbgAbhZ6MAhJEUCXqbM4Q2A8',```
I've swapped  createAccountWIthSeed with findProgramAddress in the helloworld repo.
```
  const GREETING_SEED = 'OgWtHESIlSfvTuwkWqTBYMFogtroUqSt';
  [ greetedPubkey, greetedBump ] = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
    [ Buffer.from(GREETING_SEED, 'utf8') ],
    programId,
  );```
But when I run `npm run start` the result is:
``` Program log: Greeted account does not have the correct program id
```
Can anyone tell me what I'm missing?
do we have solana validator command to setup up config ? cant find it again under /bin ... 😦 
is windows development possible anyways?
Hi, all! Is there a simple way to get all active delegators of a given vote account (using API)?
cool, what a wonderful news ... is there any vague estimation at least ? because i would postpone the start of my development until i can run my own test validator then, if its not quite far in the futures
are any rust serializers capable of doing it? will bincode work ehre?
Hello, im new here anyone also having a hard time setting up tools? it's around 1hr for me to download the solana tools is this normal?

sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.7.14/install)"
I need it to be able to be deserialized by this
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#from
it is not available for Windows. if you are using Windows, you need to use a vm or just use devnet or testnet to continue your development
oh I think you can try `bincode::serialize(&tx);`
ups i referenced wrong statement, but i've meant your answer regarding the validator under https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator
solana-test-validator is not part of the binaries under /bin
where do i get it finally?
or should I just be extracting that `serialize_and_encode` thing that doesnt seem to be a public API ?
like, what's this thing about it sending to a node? I'm just trying to serialize it . not send it to the blockchain yet
Question. what is the best way to listen to incoming spl tokens to an especific account?  im trying to detect payments coming, always from same mint
thanks man, i was lost in the "Validating" section of the guides haha 🙂
this says it submits a "signed transaction", and does some kind of check to make sure it works? but I suppose I can disable that
at least, I think. so i'm trying to serialize a partially signed transaction to a buffer , and then I want a webpage to request this partially signed txn. then it will use phantom to let the user sign off on the txn and then submits that to the blockchain.
now I get it, i'll be able to proceed from here
oh okay, I didn't know about this API. thanks a lot
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/PublicKey.html#createProgramAddress
I don't see that function or any relating to creating program addresses: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html
your account in client should use createProgramAddress
are you finding for this https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/client/src/rpc_client.rs#L846
basically, my question is, does this seralizer exist yet? or do I have to program it if I want to do this

yeah i'm wondering- the `seralize()` function wants some kind of seralizer object in rust and i'm not sure what to put there
I think serialize tx follow the rule in https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/transactions
so you can serialize transaction in rust
and deserialize in js by https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#from

        ],
        "OgWtHESIlSfvTuwkWqTBYMFogtroUqSt"
    )?;
```
How do I get that seed to work inside
Hi everyone!
```  const ESCROW_SEED = 'OgWtHESIlSfvTuwkWqTBYMFogtroUqSt';
  escrowPubKey = await PublicKey.createWithSeed(
    payer.publicKey,
    ESCROW_SEED,
    programId,
  );

  // Check if the greeting account has already been created
  const escrowAccount = await connection.getAccountInfo(escrowPubKey);
  if (escrowAccount === null) {
    console.log(
      'Creating account',
      escrowPubKey.toBase58(),
      'to hold funds...',
    );
    const lamports = await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(
      ESCROW_SIZE,
    );

    const transaction = new Transaction().add(
      SystemProgram.createAccountWithSeed({
        fromPubkey: payer.publicKey,
        basePubkey: payer.publicKey,
        seed: ESCROW_SEED,
        newAccountPubkey: escrowPubKey,
        lamports,
        space: ESCROW_SIZE,
        programId,
      }),
    );```
So my seed is 'OgWtHESIlSfvTuwkWqTBYMFogtroUqSt'?
Hi is the solhack.com website non-operational? Haven't been able to open since yesterday..
actually you have to calculate the escrow_account account before you send this tx.
so you just pass the same seed which you use before you send this tx or you can write a fixed string, and your local use the same seed to prepare accounts
it can host a local node https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator
if you did not generate the PDA, you do not need to use invoke_signed
its the same seed you used to generate the PDA with
how do I get this seed?
the seed for the PDA
can anybody with a firm grip of the invoke_signed function help me with my missing piece

```    invoke_signed(
        &system_instruction::transfer(escrow_account.key, user_account.key, lamports),
        &[
            escrow_account.clone(),
            user_account.clone(),
            system_account.clone(),
        ],
        ???? // what goes here...?
    )?;
```
does anyone know if this is possible? I need to pass serialized metaplex transactions into web3 as the metaplex web3 API doesn't exist yet, which makes it much more difficult to integrate into my program
try to set your DNS to google
how is the `id()` function being imported into scope in `solana-program-library` integration tests? (e.g. feature-proposal)
i just took phantom wallet in advance and it lets me choose localhost, which is why i though there is a way to run my own box to harm nobody
or are all meant to connect to DEVnet ?
hey guys, just wanna start building my first dapp on SOL, but i cant find a guide for setting up a validator for localhost dev
or try a different browser
keep reloading the page
`Access to fetch at 'https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/' from origin '(mysiteurl)' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status.`

any ideas ?
have u managed to solve this ??
is the wire format for txns compatible between these interfaces?
we can see here that it has a serde serializer . and so i'm expected to supply a serialization object. I need something that the web3 JS can understand in its own deserialization API
https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/1.7.14/solana_sdk/transaction/struct.Transaction.html#impl-Serialize
what serializer do I use in rust so that I can deseralize my transactions in JS?
i mean i have already created repo on github and right now i m waiting for verify
Hi there i have a question about creating your own token, how much time required to verify own token??

something's wrong with explorer here
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js
It doesnt use borsh, i guess because the structure is pretty simple.
does someone have a borsh struct in js of the solana token parser (https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/account-decoder/src/parse_token.rs) ?
https://docs.metaplex.com
yeah , the docs are empty at places. tty this:
https://hackmd.io/@levicook/HJcDneEWF
thats why you should have some authority defined, a key that that must sign your programs transfer instruction.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-signed-accounts
the one that was created with create_account_with_seed.
cool, I'm a try again inside my rust program after. my break, thank's for the input y'all
it will be an escrow account for my program, I will send funds into it, and return after certain time (i.e. like vesting)
Its a cross program call. Your program will call system transfer and sign with the account.
why are you calling it escrow ?
you can't do it from js only. You have to define a instruction inside your program that you will call from js.
Escrow is the new account created
Sorry but which account are you calling escrow ?
what's the equivalent in js?

I'm trying todo this, transferFunds works but the returnFunds fails with `Error: Signature verification failed`

```
export async function transferFunds(): Promise<void> {
  console.log('time to send some funds...')
  const lamports = 1000000;
  const transaction = new Transaction().add(
    SystemProgram.transfer({
      fromPubkey: payer.publicKey,
      lamports,
      toPubkey: escrowPubKey
    }),
  );
  await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [payer]);
}

export async function returnFunds(): Promise<void> {
  console.log('time to return some funds...')
  const programKeypair = await createKeypairFromFile(PROGRAM_KEYPAIR_PATH);
  const lamports = 1000000;
  const transaction = new Transaction().add(
    SystemProgram.transfer({
      fromPubkey: escrowPubKey,
      lamports,
      toPubkey: payer.publicKey,
    }),
  );
  await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [programKeypair]);
}```
Thats why you are giving the programid when creating the account.
Your escrow account is owned by your program. It doesn't have a private key. You should look into invoke_signed.
maybe hardcoding the payout instruction in the program with our wallet address and that's the only way to withdraw?
I am still thinking about that. Maybe we can fund a program and the program itself can sign and pay for transaction ,but If that is possible probably someone can drown all of our tokens.
I wonder how this works for accounts owned by the program, you think they'd be able to send funds themselves
yeh I think I'm going to try to create a whole new wallet and have that be the escrowKeyPair
There is no other way.
I think in this case your pair needs to be the current wallet
But how do I get from escrowPubKey to the keypair...
```export async function returnFunds(): Promise<void> {
  console.log('returning funds to ', payer.publicKey.toBase58());
  const lamports = 1000000;
  const transaction = new Transaction().add(
    SystemProgram.transfer({
      fromPubkey: escrowPubKey,
      toPubkey: payer.publicKey,
      lamports,
    }),
  );
  await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [????]); // not sure how to get the escrow key pair into here```
This works for a transaction because the payer keypair is known
```  const transaction = new Transaction().add(
    SystemProgram.transfer({
      fromPubkey: payer.publicKey,
      lamports,
      toPubkey: escrowPubKey
    }),
  );
  await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [payer]);```
How do we get the keypair for these accounts we're creating...
Yes
Ok, thanks. By "correct" you mean the exact number of lamports necessary for the requested Account data size?
Yeah I was looking for that precise parser but it's written in rust while I need it in js using borsh :(
Yes! I am telling you that because I was sending like 4 lamports while I was playing with my program and I was getting null on my client. Also it takes a few seconds to create the account.
But the specification of lamports is done on the on-chain program, right? Where I am defining the instruction
Also it is very important to send the correct amount of lamports otherwise the getAccInfo will still return null even if you can see the account created on the solana explorer
Yes it was weird for me too. It took me 2-3 days to figure it out
This is my program code so far encase it helps
```    // Iterating accounts is safer then indexing
    let accounts_iter = &mut accounts.iter();

    // Get the account to say hello to
    let escrow_account = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;

    // The account must be owned by the program in order to modify its data
    if escrow_account.owner != program_id {
        msg!("Greeted account does not have the correct program id");
        return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId);
    }

    msg!("great, the program ID is the owner");

    let user_account = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;

    let system_account = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;

    let lamports = 1000000;

    msg!("Return {} lamports to the user", lamports);
    invoke(
        &system_instruction::transfer(escrow_account.key, user_account.key, lamports),
        &[
            escrow_account.clone(),
            user_account.clone(),
            system_account.clone(),
        ],
    )?;```
I didn't know that. I thought I need to have a fully created Account, which was weird then. Thanks you very much!
yes
So it's enough to pass a Pubkey to my program so that it receives the corresponding account_info object?
Alright, amazing
like it's shown on my code that I sent you
now instead of calling the transaction you need to pass this escrowPubKey to your program and call create_account_with_seed() from there
this part is checking if the account has been created
escrowPubKey = await PublicKey.createWithSeed(
    payer.publicKey,
    ESCROW_SEED,
    programId,
  );

  // Check if the greeting account has already been created
  const escrowAccount = await connection.getAccountInfo(escrowPubKey);
If you see TacoBell's code
Ok sorry
I don't personally
This way you are creating it from the client
So, why create it on the on-chain program again?
when you sendAndConfirmTransaction
yes it is
But isn't this creating an Account on the blockchain?
updated to include pubkey creation
here is my front-end code:
```    const ESCROW_SEED = 'OgWtHESIlSfvTuwkWqTBYMFogtroUqSt';
  escrowPubKey = await PublicKey.createWithSeed(
    payer.publicKey,
    ESCROW_SEED,
    programId,
  );

  // Check if the greeting account has already been created
  const escrowAccount = await connection.getAccountInfo(escrowPubKey);
  if (escrowAccount === null) {
    console.log(
      'Creating account',
      escrowPubKey.toBase58(),
      'to hold funds...',
    );
    const lamports = await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(
      ESCROW_SIZE,
    );

    const transaction = new Transaction().add(
      SystemProgram.createAccountWithSeed({
        fromPubkey: payer.publicKey,
        basePubkey: payer.publicKey,
        seed: ESCROW_SEED,
        newAccountPubkey: escrowPubKey,
        lamports,
        space: ESCROW_SIZE,
        programId,
      }),
    );
    await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [payer]);
  } else {
    console.log(
      'got account',
      escrowPubKey.toBase58(),
      'to hold funds...',
    );
  }
}```
Can you show me the client's code? For example, the hello-world example creates the Account on the client side
Until you pass it to the create_account_with_seed
You are creating the account but not saving it as it doesn't exist.
anyone else having issues with the devnet SOL airdrop?
The client.
Who? The client is not creating it on blockchain? Or the on-chain program is not creating it on the blockchain?
I had a chat about that on Monday or Tuesday. Here the problem is that you have to create the account on the client ,because you need to pass it to the invoke function
It's not creating it on the block chain.
But if the client creates it before why is your program creating it again?
const acc = await PublicKey.createWithSeed(
      payer_id,
"Seed",
      program_id
    );
I don't think it can be, I think we would have to split theinstructions...

one to create accounts, one to query using accounts
Yes you need to create it on your client like so
If `new_acc` is not created yet, how it's passed in the instruction in first place? I am confused about this
There are a few things you need to know:
1: Owner -that's the program_id owner
2: from-that's the payer
3:to_pubkey - that's the new account pubkey
My doubt about that is: how do you pass the `new_acc` to the program at the beginning? How is your client calling that instruction?
that is my working code
https://pastebin.com/7ehwdx7T
I can help you with that
Can an on-chain program create accounts? if so, how? I have the instruction but I don't know what account_info's I need to pass to the `invoke`, I only have the account_info of the funder. Here's my code
available somewhere would love it if someone could link it here
or is there a tutorial or js package
has anyone used the meta plex candy machine smart contract and interacted with via js to generate nfts
that's what I wanted todo too, <@!585868308419444749> can you comment on how we are meant todo Transactions if we can't use solana-sdk?
But I want to use Transaction which is in solana-sdk
Yes I am.
I'm running into the `Signature verification failed` error.

Maybe what I'm trying todo won't work? My flow is:

1. create account (new_account) inside client [this works]
2. send funds from user_account to new_account [this works]
3. return funds from new_account to user_account 

This is what my code on my client looks like:
```export async function returnFunds(): Promise<void> {
  console.log('returning funds to ', payer.publicKey.toBase58());
  const instruction = new TransactionInstruction({
    keys: [
      {pubkey: escrowPubKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true},
      {pubkey: payer.publicKey, isSigner: false, isWritable: false},
      {pubkey: programId, isSigner: false, isWritable: false},
    ],
    programId,
    data: Buffer.alloc(0), // All instructions are hellos
  });
  await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
    connection,
    new Transaction().add(instruction),
    [payer],
  ).then(result => console.log(result));
}
```
I just did a search of the Discord channel and trent said this "Use solana-program not solana-sdk" back in may when someone had the same problem as us
Are you on MacOS? I am.
I also get this same error. I was unable to find any information, hopefully someone else can chime in. If not, might have to create a github issue.
https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints
Hi, Whenever I try to add solana_sdk to my dependencies I am getting this error and many more. I can see in other project that it is as dependency but not sure how they build it
are there any publicly  available addresses to query the JSON RPC API?

or must we run our own validator nodes locally?
you could do GetTransaction and parse the log.
and then inside my client, I am doing....
```export async function returnFunds(): Promise<void> {
  console.log('returning funds to ', payer.publicKey.toBase58());
  const instruction = new TransactionInstruction({
    keys: [{pubkey: escrowPubKey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true}],
    programId,
    data: Buffer.alloc(0), // All instructions are hellos
  });
  await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
    connection,
    new Transaction().add(instruction),
    [payer],
  );
}
````
```msg!("Hello World Rust program entrypoint");

...

// The account must be owned by the program in order to modify its data
if escrow_account.owner != program_id {
    msg!("Greeted account does not have the correct program id");
    return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId);
}
```
Is there a way to print the msg! commands into the command line?
Metada account is a mint decorator. If someone wants to add more fields or something, strategy is to make another decorator program.

how would i use local testnet validator sol on devnet? would anyone be able to send ~10 devnet sol please?
thank you.... but if i want to add some other functionality then i would need to create an add on program on the token-metadata program?
local test validator? 
Or ask here, somebody is maybe willing to share.
best place to source a large amount of devnet sol?
I say should because I didn't see any reimplementations of the metadata program yet and I am wondering what would one gain by doing it.
it should be possible. if the account byte offset structure is same, then it should work.
<@!401880349166141441> thanks!
the metadata account
By metada structure do you mean the structure of a metadata account or json?
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getconfirmedsignaturesforaddress2
you can filter by block
https://github.com/allartprotocol/unity-solana-wallet
i would not say recommend, but its the only one I know off.
Hello everyone, so i have looked at the metaplex docs, and for us to implement the NFT metadata standard do we have to just recreate their data structure or metadata structure or do we have to use their deployed program? if only creating a Metadata structure according to their standard is enough then that would be great.. looking forward to some helpful comments.
I'm also after docs on how to monitor transaction data for transactions involving particular accounts... can I query the API for all transactions involving a specifc account since a certain time?
Are we talking (a) 0.000325 SOL or (b) 0.50 SOL?
what is the rough cost to deploy a small program on mainnet?
Could anyone point me in the right direction?
But there’s just so much info
I was looking for resources on how to read on chain data
Heya guys, new to the discord and already in awe at the available resources
happy to help!
thanks 🙂
looks good to me
No, all DMs are a scam, please report in <#812122623654887444>
is this real admin?
<@!539801435571748868> the fullcode - thanks a lot, i will be able to refactor it into our real interface now, do you agree with the verification of the account this way? to verify if it exist before

exactly. i was worried about it being on chain. So this sums it up. thanks <@!539801435571748868>
<@!791306780176023582> you can refer this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cn-HnG_yns
I'm not sure about your example... I wouldn't store a keypair on-chain, since then anyone has access to your private key!
<@!539801435571748868> https://explorer.solana.com/tx/gpxy2B6HmG2xrj2LxJ9V1vKXcWPBmgYBh2WiE5N59kzbrod2K1vDBtUsKsVFmJNaqtPKxja6X7ExY2HSFZJcxyD?cluster=testnet thanks a lot bro
I can't remember, but it'll be the cost of creating the mint + transaction fee
<@513742723111714817> got it. so you will just update the account keypair in the struct like you update the counter(in hello_world example). Then retrieve it in the server and write to a file?
yes: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/9a29e79f55adeda4ce5262772946682b512fe756/associated-token-account/program/src/lib.rs#L62
you mean that the funding address need to be a system account?
You have all the instructions, and the `create_associated_token_account` instruction declares that it needs a signature from `usdc_sol_coin.get_pubkey()`, and then that key doesn't sign later, thus the error
But the signature occured later, not at this point no ?
You can store the keypair as a file somewhere
what is the fee in sol for creating a token?
<@!539801435571748868> If i create an account on rust. How do i store the keypair so that i can use it later for transactions?
you have it wrong in the code you posted, it's expecting a signature from `usdc_sol_coin.get_pubkey()`
Yes right now i did:

```rust
let destination = spl_associated_token_account::get_associated_token_address(&destination, &contract_key);
let instruction_creation = create_associated_token_account(&funding_address, &destination, &contract_key);
```
depends on what you mean by "easier" 🙂
this works on all networks
there is no easier way
```
let instruction_creation = spl_associated_token_account::create_associated_token_account(
            &usdc_sol_coin.key_pair.pubkey(),
            &destination,
            &usdc_sol_coin.get_underlying_contract_pubkey(),
        );
```
but not test only on the main network
ohhhh i got it
nop only 2:

- creation
- transfer
are there any other instructions?
Take a look at https://spl.solana.com/token#example-creating-your-own-fungible-token
The transaction doesn't sign, so there is no tx `solana::solana_tests::tests::solana_test_spl_transactions' panicked at 'Transaction::sign failed with error NotEnoughSigners'`
There may be something else here, do you have an explorer link to a transaction?
what is the easiest way to create my solana token?
Do we agree that's the wallet that will send the tx, that will ask to create the account?
if i remove it that's fine.
usdc_sol_coin.key_pair -> is the authority key

but somehow the tx refuse to be signed with the creation instruction
```rust
let destination = solana_sdk::pubkey::Pubkey::from_str("AYJmtzc9D4KU6xsDzhKShFyYKUNXY622j9QoQEo4LfpX").unwrap();
        let amount = spl_token::ui_amount_to_amount(0.0001, usdc_sol_coin.decimals);
        let destination = &spl_associated_token_account::get_associated_token_address(
            &destination,
            &usdc_sol_coin.get_underlying_contract_pubkey(),
        );
        let instruction_creation = spl_associated_token_account::create_associated_token_account(
            &usdc_sol_coin.get_pubkey().unwrap(),
            &destination,
            &usdc_sol_coin.get_underlying_contract_pubkey(),
        );
        instructions.push(instruction_creation);

        println!("dest {}", destination);
        let result_instruction = spl_token::instruction::transfer(
            &spl_token::id(),
            &usdc_sol_coin.get_pubkey().unwrap(),
            destination,
            &usdc_sol_coin.key_pair.pubkey(),
            &vec![],
            amount,
        );
        println!("token_program_id: {}", &spl_token::id());
        println!("source_pubkey: {}", &usdc_sol_coin.get_pubkey().unwrap());
        println!("destination_pubkey: {}", &destination);
        println!("authority_pubkey: {}\n", usdc_sol_coin.key_pair.pubkey());
        assert_eq!(result_instruction.is_err(), false);
        let instruction = result_instruction.unwrap();
        instructions.push(instruction);
        let msg = solana_sdk::message::Message::new(&instructions, Some(&usdc_sol_coin.key_pair.pubkey()));
        let signers = vec![&usdc_sol_coin.key_pair];
        let mut transaction = Transaction::new(&signers, msg, hash);
```
It's the same
Ah, if that's not the same as  `usdc_sol_coin.key_pair`, it needs to sign too
The wallet that send the tx
Just one signature should do it, no need to double up.  Who's paying for the transaction?
The person that receive the token have to use `get_associated_token_address` and then he can use his authorithy key
I think it's from the other side in this case
yes. I just wanted to know when someone creates an account on rust. how do they store the keypair so that it can be used to transfer the received tokens
I have a Structure name `SolanaCoin` that contains the `key_pair` derived from the wallet seed.

I do not store the key_pair created by `create_associated_token_account` because from what i understand it just return an instruction.
Hey <@!206445134122844170> when you create an account using `create_associated_token_account` in rust. where do you store the keypair of that account?
The number of signers should be equal to the number of instructions if i'm not mistaken?
```
let mut signers = vec![&usdc_sol_coin.key_pair, &usdc_sol_coin.key_pair];
let mut transaction = Transaction::new(&signers, msg, hash);
```

I should have enough signers, i don't get it '_'
they seems to use the same signer as me
let me check shortly
Probably something missing, can you try to mimic what they're doing at https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3FWawkaBNVCnbwyUEsDyZ9Go3rFgbF9bqzRWR9Prkf7275gpDzaTvE52dyCM93nrNUm7cDCGnBjLgCSbBh8mq9Uh?cluster=testnet ?
keep them all in the same transaction to keep things cheap
All of those parsers are defined directly in the validator: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/account-decoder/src you'll need some info from the program for any other programs, unfortunately
i've tried to add this instruction created by `create_associated_token_account` and i got `Transaction::sign failed with error NotEnoughSigners` :/
yep, small question, can i combine 2 instructions creation, + transfer in the same tx or should i separate them?
You can do `get_associated_token_address` and then `get_account_info` on the result to see if the account exists, it'll probably be much faster
Hey guys, I'm trying to have my Solana NFTs read in Unity. Has anyone figured out that integration part? Also, which Solana-Unity wallet would you recommend? Thanks
What is the best way to create an account and store the keypair info?
can i create accounts in programs(rust)? if yes, how can i store the keypairs. I will need the keypair for fund transfers?
or is it best to just Create using <@!750257486975467582>na/web3.js and store the keypair as files in server?
maybe i can use `get_token_accounts_by_owner` before to verify
You've stumbled on an annoying usability issue that we may fix soon, sorry 😕
i need help with creating a nft collection on solana (e.g. degen apes or solbears), but i dont know where to start. i know how to create smart contracts on ethereum but it seems like such a pain on solana. i would greatly appreciate if someone could point me towards some resources that could help me get started
`get_associated_token_address` doesn't seems to create it, should i use `create_associated_token_account` instead ?

But there is no way to verify that it exist before creating it?
Can someone help me in finding the borsh struct used by getParsedAccountInfo (web3)?
We don't have historical account data at the moment, only transaction data.  You could look at all Pyth transactions within the historical block, and see if you can find the transaction that sets the oracle price
Hi 🙋‍♂️ Is it possible to call getProgramInfo on a specific block? My use case is to get pyth oracle's BTC price in a historical block
i love you jon, marry me.
❤️
Take a look at the transaction I linked.  It creates the user's associated account if it doesn't exist, then does the transfer, which is roughly what you'll do
But if we don't have a faucet and want to transfer for the first time?
How much state? the test validator can actually download all the accounts you need from mainnet before starting itself, using the `-c` flag on startup
Take a look at the associated token program, it was designed for this exact situation: https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account
If you use the faucet, it will create your associated token account and send the USDC.  I just tried it, check out the transaction: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3FWawkaBNVCnbwyUEsDyZ9Go3rFgbF9bqzRWR9Prkf7275gpDzaTvE52dyCM93nrNUm7cDCGnBjLgCSbBh8mq9Uh?cluster=testnet
Thank you, will look into it
yeah, but I need the mainnet state 🙂
Absolutely, you can take a look at the token list, you'll just need to specify `103` as the chain id: https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/blob/b13bb3faae979f18a9b763c5a02a1b61559a137e/src/lib/tokenlist.ts#L8
Yeah definitely, if you can use a `solana-test-validator`, you'll get much better service overall 🙂
I have a question that will sound stupid but, how do we send tokens to an address that has not yet received this token?

For example user foo creates a Solana wallet on the testnet, I want to send him USDC for the first time, but he doesn't have a USDC public address yet, only Solana, I want to use his Solana address to send him of USDC for the first time.

I've tried the following code:

```rust
 let destination = solana_sdk::pubkey::Pubkey::from_str("FJmNcTMTjh59mhy3h2wW3K5nW8csdswJZbcZxAskjiBv").unwrap();
        let amount = spl_token::ui_amount_to_amount(0.0001, usdc_sol_coin.decimals);
        let result_instruction = spl_token::instruction::transfer(
            &spl_token::id(),
            &usdc_sol_coin.get_pubkey().unwrap(),
            &destination, //< doesn't work until i use the pubkey from the account, doesn't work with a parent_key
            &usdc_sol_coin.key_pair.pubkey(),
            &vec![],
            amount,
        );
```

And it's seems that `spl_token::instruction::transfer` will not search for the underlying account with `get_token_accounts_by_owner`

But even if it's the case, what if the destination pubkey doesn't have an account yet for USDC? 

I'm a bit skeptical, because if i try: <https://usdcfaucet.com/> on a Solana address that doesn't have yet USDC, that works, the account will be created - any tips?

If i check my wallet in `Phantom` both `USDC`, and `SOL` have the same Public address.
has anyone gotten an 0x66 error while trying to use the candy machine?
Thanks, my system makes heavy use of the wss endpoint, do you think that it would be better idea if I created my own validator node and called its rpc endpoint directly instead of using the public one? would I still be subject to the rate limits?
Hey, I want to name my token on devnet. Is it possible to do so? And how?
testnet seems slow, but running. and wss may be overwhelmed unfortunately 🤷
the wss rpc is down on devnet and not working on testnet atm
I just tried an airdrop and it worked fine
ah
devnet is down?
its up again.
Is there another free rpc for devnet ?
Hey, what can be the reason for a `invalid account data for instruction` error?
ya devnet is down again😅
what do
Error: RPC request error: cluster version query failed: HTTP status server error (503 Service Unavailable) for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com/)
Some of the RPC nodes are dead, devnet itself is up
https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet is down?
nvm
is devnet down
The community at this point, it's a group effort
<@!445425471027544095> also who is in charge of dapp-scaffold repo? There are alot of issues with it and Its been inactive since August
There's nobody actively working on it right now, so no ETA at the moment
No worries if not (but just seeing if I can get a date)
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/issues/2248
Is it possible to get an ETA on this issue? (weeks/ months)
and low airdrop so I prefer devnet for now. My program cost 1.5 Sol per deployment and I need lots of SOl for my development
testnet is much slower than devnet.
Reminder: `solana-test-validator` works great and is 100% local.

But yes, devnet is having a bit of trouble.  The team is working on bringing the struggling rpc nodes back up ASAP
do you use CLI?
For me after I airdrop 1 or 2 solanas throws an exception
well, its been up and down for weeks. Not good at all, and devnet airdrop now limits to 1 Sol per request,.
yes. looks like it
hi Pikachoo, been while. are you ok?
devnet failed again?
yes
Is anyone here working on any opensource project, I am new to Solana and would like to learn by building real things. If there is something on which I can help, please do let me know!

PS: Coming from a MERN Stack background!
What is the best way to create an account and store the keypair info?

Sorry, 19 not 18. I'll read up on this. Thank you for your help and your time
See public is actually 32 char in hex representation , but yours is not hex representation so I think
Guys actually I was writing a function to create merkle Tree in rust, nodes and leaves are of different type since leaves don't hold reference to anything but hold file and its hash  , whereas nodes hold reference to other nodes and hold hash  , but the last layer of node hold reference to leaf , so how do I make a field that can hold pointer to both these types I tried it to through enum but it makes things messy since then you need to perform match on each element of vector of those enums even when u know its vector of particular variant  , if I use option it would be memory inefficient so , can someone guide me
speaking of address validation, this popped up as well: among others:
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/892652899576999946
I would read through that section, and if your inclined read up on more surrounding it, as there is a lot of literature.  also your saying ed25518 ?  not ed25519?
Yeah, I'm super confused. `BHtBbusDRDPtypwzAHykxfYjWXZcoxwf4P2VjGecviZr` is my public address with Phantom Wallet. 44 characters in length. Maybe ed25518 isn't the correct usage
so it it due to base58 encoding versus base64?
there is also this:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/439be87/src/transaction.ts#L545
No. Can you help me understand why I'm receiving 44 characters? do I need to convert the public key somehow? this is all brand new to me
have you seen this?
https://docs.solana.com/integrations/exchange#validating-user-supplied-account-addresses-for-withdrawals
So the I send the phantom wallet public key to my backend along with the signature. I have the nonce used for the public key stored on the backend. I'm trying to validate the public key and signature, but the public keys is 44 characters when ed25518 expects 32 characters
what are you trying to do?  and how are you trying to do it?
Hey all. I'm using Phantom and their public key is 44 characters in length. When I try to verify on the backend with ed25519 it complaining about the public key length. Anyone know what I'm missing?
moral support if nothing else <:koolaid:831946858178936845>
And thanks for the help
Oh jeez. yes I'm there. Though. was in it currently excuse me
meant discord.  not forum.  
https://discord.gg/T8m5RUmz
Did not knew there was one. Will do thanks. Trying with --verbose now, saw it's there on the `solana deploy`
hmm.  you try in the anchor forum?
Seems unable to resume yes, I've never uploaded anything to test net in months. Always these issues, each time I try. Even with new keypairs <:pepeThink:844646497911046164>
`anchor deploy` does not have a --verbose
hmm. its not able to resume?  
and is that from verbose logging?  or what if anything else does the verbose logging indicate for deploy?
Well a few tries but still the good ol `Error: Data writes to account failed: Pubsub error: ConnectionError(Protocol(HandshakeIncomplete))`
Is it "standard" for the testnet, should I keep trying?
Yes I just realized
did you pass the recovered keypair as the signer?
Now running into insufficient fund <:pepeThink:844646497911046164> does that makes sense since the recovered pubkey is not the same as my config wallet
Did not work earlier, retrying.
It's in a script so that's not optimal, but if that works for now
did you try the resume deploy instructions?
I've been dodging it for so long due to this, but I need pyth for tests...
Hmmm but now I hit the usual. Why can't I get anything on devnet
Thank you so much.
I sent you some
Cannnot get airdrop on Devnet, any virtually rich person to send me some sol @`aca3VWxwBeu8FTZowJ9hfSKGzntjX68EXh1N9xpE1PC` <a:pepelaugh:834817527900799078>
you can use filters, there isnt pagination, yet..
Hi Guys, Can the response from getProgramAccounts be paginated? if so how can I do that?
What's the question?
I've mostly been testing on localnet, sometimes devnet without success, thing is I need pyth now but still getting this error
Ok might be temporary then? weirdly enough I've encountered this issue everytime I've tried for the past few weeks, so maybe i've been very unlucky
For me it was working perfectly fine... then suddenly it start making issues
Currently having the same issue, i never can deploy anything on devnet....
Hi Guys.. Were you able to resolve this
Probably link to not having the whole thing in rosetta
nvm I solved  with api dev net cluster
any solution for that?
the getTokenLargestAccounts endpoint only gives the top20, but i would be interested in more than 20
Error: RPC request error: cluster version query failed: error sending request for url (http://localhost:8899/): error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 111)
hey all, does anyone know how to get the top holders of a certain token beyond the top 20?
Oh yeah, just tried, it's back!
back to normal i guess
But I still have an old iMac which isn't M1, there is no problem running localhost validator on it, I'll probably move to it for development until the devnet is back but it feels a lot slower when developing on the old machine 😅  that I'm not used to at all
devnet down
Oh thanks, I did try something like that before.. uninstall brew etc, but cant recall whether I did it right or not,.... now when I run on my M1, I'm getting the illegal hardware instruction
me too
yes
oh seems like someone else is having the same issue
getting 503 on devnet, anyone else?
You have to uninstall everything from the bottom, brew, rustup, solana related packages

Then start a rosetta terminal, and reinstall everything in x86_64. It's not as annoying as it seems, appart from making your machine a non M1 one anymore <a:pepelaugh:834817527900799078> 

I'm currently running it on my M1 imac
<@!443079510053748743> pls help me
I can walk you through it. I'm stuck cause I need to get some data from Pyth (that I can eventually mock too using `solana account -u devnet -o ./accountdata.json HovQMDrbAgAYPCmHVSrezcSmkMtXSSUsLDFANExrZh2J` I assume)
You can
Yup, it's down now, getting  error 503.... hope it'll be back soon, I rely on the devnet for testing as I can't run test validator on localhost due to my MacBook Air M1 🙁  havent figured out how to get the validator to run on M1
hey I am trying to install solana cli and when using this command on windows C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe v1.7.13 I get an error : "The system cannot execute the specified program." pls help
Had same issue, now it's down. Or I reached API rate limit?
Mempool-less Transaction Forwarding ProtocolMessage Flow
Oic , thanks, btw usually how long that I need to wait for it to get stabilised ??
Usually it means whatever RPC node you got is just a bit behind. Would probably have to wait for stabilization or hope you hit a good node
Hi all,  I'm pretty new with Solana, Today I'm testing my app and Rust on-chain program on devnet, guess too many testings getting this "Node is behind" error? 😅   not sure what to do next??
Agreed.  Thank you for your inputs.
thanks!
I think this endpoint is ok but seems there are some issues on devent.  use testnet or localnet instead
you can use a large size account and update holders into it.
but it is a large cost, and you will need to update the list continuously
Dammit I figured it out
is there any better dev net rpc node?
`https://api.devnet.solana.com` this rpc node
Can someone explain to me why this is happening? Doing the intro program
which endpoint you used? this error message means the node does not catchup
if you use your own node, you need to check its status
So I can prepare and update my program with the holder data.
That's what I feared
Ahh OK
I don't think you can do it on program.
before you execute an instruction, you will need to prepare all accounts.
Hi, is something wrong in devnet? the latest slot is from 20 mins ago
Hello, anybody knows about the hell token-list repo?

Hello folks - how do I find all holders of a token given the token address, from inside a program?
Thank you
I sent 50 devnet SOL though.
Then I'll ban you 😉
then i'll post in every minute.
When, like yesterday 🙂
Nobody has time to read the scrollback to find it
I already posted it.
24QG4J14vQhHaXJxB3P4asGRMLr7a9GoCu7LSZqVHKkF
Why not provide your address along with the request so somebody doesn't need to ask for it.  It's clearly a prerequisite
can anybody send me 10 sol on devnet?
there isn't an equivalent for parsing data from multipleaccounts right?
note that it just supports parsing a few different program account types, it's not a general purpose api unfortunately. It's most useful for stuff like stake, vote, and token accounts
thank you
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getParsedAccountInfo
in web3.js is there any way to get account data parsed in the same way it's done by the json rpc api call "getAccountInfo" with encoding:jsonparsed?
Thanks!! I will take a look of that!!

Okay thank you very much
metaplex does a great job of handling nft mints etc
I mean... if you're asking these questions, yes
I mean is metaplex the best way to go for ?
You want the metaplex discord
Anybody here familiar with creating nfts on solana?
provider etc is given in these outer components, then the main code is NavbarSansProvider (in which there are calls to useWallet that work), and within that are routes to pages inside that dont get anything when calling useWallet
const Navbar = () => (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint="https://solana-api.projectserum.com">
        <WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect>
            <WalletModalProvider>
                <NavbarSansProvider />

yes
Good evening, we want to create a nft collection on solana, and I am looking for a proper way to do that
https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/ this one?
did you do something to be able to access that? Doesnt work for me... not sure if its related to the error i mentioned earlier or something Im missing
yes
if not I can remove my router and just put everything in one big component... but that sounds messy
are other people able to call useWallet inside nested components and successfully access the connected wallet from a parent component (react)?
haha green name 👼

Hi guys. When using the JSON RPC api there's a rate limit set for 100 request / 10s. Is there a way around this? If I interacted with the Solana blockchain using Rust can I get over that rate limiting? 🤔
is the explorer not available to Australian resident?
black on my phone as well
they could add an assertion at the end of the transaction after simulating
weird, it is black in 2 browsers
hmm works for me
The explorer is broken /!\ https://explorer.solana.com/ I get a black screen
simulation is a good tool in other cases though, like when you have a complex system and you want to know the output (because no return value (yet))
Highly not recommended for any kind of safety
This is unsafe by the way
At some point I thought we could have an ordered linked list of scores and user ids but that's not possible since we would need to pass in all the accounts if we were to insert in that linked list
is there no way of doing this on chain? e.g. if top 10 users of an on chain contest get a reward we would need have a ClaimReward function for winners to call but we would need to check the wallet is actually one of the winners (by score)

Hello guys, does someone know how I can create an account on a wallet for a specific mint that I want to receive plz ?
been having the issue for a while but didn't seem to be an obvious problem, but for the sake of a different issue, is anyone familiar with the Unhandled Rejection (QuotaExceededError): Failed to execute 'setItem' on 'Storage': Setting the value of 'walletName' exceeded the quota. error when connecting a wallet with react?
Is there any other cases that I need to parse responses to understand?
I'm having trouble closing an account owned by my program. I had no issue closing accounts owned by a PDA. However I don't know how to close a non-token account (storing state) owned by my program directly. I tried sending a `close_account` ix with `invoke()`, however, I get back an error `signer privilege escalated`
Afaik I should use invoke as the account is not used by a PDA.
On the other hand it is weird that I have to parse messages to understand whether I get a 429 error or not. I should check that if a an error response starts with `429 Too Many Requests` or not 🙂 I just realized that I have another kind of message: `Transaction was not confirmed in 30.00 seconds. It is unknown if it succeeded or failed. Check signature xxxx` I believe that I use `JSON RPC` API but responses are not `JSON` Either I miss something or it is so weird
I use web3.js 1.26.0
Are you using our web3.js? if so what version?  More recent ones should back off I think
Not really. However, how can I queue if I start to get 429 errors? I use NodeJS and couldn't find any documentation to slow down for 429 errors.
Are you ignoring a bunch of 429s before you get ECONNRESET?
Sometimes `I get read ECONNRESET` when I work on devnet. Is that specific to devnet or should I wait until Solana ecosystem gets mature?

hi can anyone airdrop me some devnet SOL to 8m7an6NW3GyRT7hokJdDhSJ8UV7bCjgj6EjWGSgCnwb1? I need ~50 SOL
solana exploer gone?
Thanks, man.
Is there a way to preview the result of an instruction sent to a program? Know if I sign this transaction, it would debit X Sol from my account?
There's no such thing as instruction-level success so far as the runtime is concerned.
correct
Whole transaction is executed atomically
the same applies?
I see. What about same TX, but different IX?
If it's in the same TX, no state changes are committed
e.g. update "withdrawn_amount"
Update pda's data
What does "update a PDA" mean?
Are transactions executed atomically? i.e. if we update a PDA and then try a token transfer and it fails, will the PDA change rollback?
lmaoo
Just don't talk shit about me on your blog 😅

ooh i had no idea there was a u128, this should be good... checking
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/libraries/math
There's also some math in  SPL
Does `u128` have what you need?
is there a not stupid way to like... do math in a solana program? i am trying to multiply an amount of coins by a pyth price to get a value for the amount and... obviously if i use u64 and divide the demicals out of the price then it rounds it (obviously). if i multiply first and divide second the u64 silently overflows. im not sure how to safely use floats for this because the numbers are so large and in any event floats for money is extreme danger already. i tried to import a bigdecimal library and the program crashes because theres no log2 syscall
More ideal that accidentally writing a buggy programming language around getProgramAccounts filters 😅
But less ideal, obviously.
Ahh. Yeah, this was what my mind was running to. Some outside authority to keep an index of some sort.
In the future, you probably want to build an accountsdb plugin and do that with an index on a proper rdbs. https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/20047
I was wondering how it's done for `getLargestAccounts` and `getTokenLargestAccounts`

Thoughts on best strategy to do a sorted lookup. "Find 10 accounts (out of 100k) with the lowest counter:u64" ?
Nope. It's a logical conjunction of all passed filters
Are there creative ways to query using `MemcmpFilter`? Other than exact match? EG query for number greater than?
Instead of passing in `{"epoch": 227}` just pass in `227`
I have several NFTs all minted from the same mint authority. Is there a way I can uniquely identify them?
Hello everyone. What's the simplest way to get arbitrary data into an account?
Anyone know how to transform an integer to u64 in javascript? I'm using the Solana Javascript API and after invoking:
`connection.getInflationReward([pk1, pk2], {"epoch": 227});
i get:
```      throw new Error('failed to get inflation reward: ' + res.error.message);
            ^

Error: failed to get inflation reward: Invalid params: invalid type: map, expected u64.
```
well thats one way.😀
alright, thanks again man
I'm starting to think that it would be easier to decompile the frontend bundle and try to understand by that haha
then there is no way I know of.
dont thank me, <@489206164270350337> is the one.
its a closed source program unfortunately
also thanks for your other answer. I had no idea about this: https://github.com/cryptogosu/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/helper/Metadata.service.ts#L188
then you have to find that programs source and look how to deserialize the data.
yes
example: if I go to dev tools and see a request made on network tab, I can copy it and redo exactly like that (by copying cURL or fetch for example). My 'devtools' in this case I assume its explorer.solana lol
do you know which program processes the instructions?
yes
ah,ok, I guess you did look at the transaction on a explorer them, but there are instructions which are "unknown" and have opaque data?
Thanks. I want to know the instruction data of a transaction, but it was already made, I got the data from blockchain. But its already compressed, I want to know what were sent before compressing / signing etc
v1.7.13 exe is not even on github? ended up downloading github release 1.7.12
Kind of. But not so much for you as for rpc servers. Devs are looking at ways to paginate the results or maybe cut off programs that have a lot of accounts.. For now top is 15Mb.
found the issue: https://release.solana.com/v1.7.13/solana-install-init-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe is denying access;

```<Error>
  <Code>AccessDenied</Code>

</Error>```
although I don't understand your question fully ( you want to know the instructions? )
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#simulateTransaction
https://github.com/cryptogosu/solana-web3-reference/blob/master/src/get-account-nfts/getAccountNFTs.ts
At what size does `getProgramAccounts` start to hit performance issues? If I expect a result of 1k plus accounts, is that a problem?
also, is there any way to discover whats the instruction data sent to an smart contract before encoding? for example, I want to simulate a request
is the `solana-install-init.exe` broken? 

I'm getting this when trying to install the latest version
```The system cannot execute the specified program.```
hey guys. How to discover the metadata of an NFT token only by having its hash? solscan do it, I tried to figure out how, couldnt yet
You need to specify the storage requirements for accounts that the program will read/write data to. The program ID is added to the `owner` field when you create the account
I have found a couple examples like this...

```   let create_account_instruction = create_account(
        payer_info.key,
        account_info.key,
        rent.minimum_balance(account_size),
        account_size as u64,
        program_id,
    );

    invoke(
        &create_account_instruction,
        &[
            payer_info.clone(),
            account_info.clone(),
            system_info.clone(),
        ],
    )?;```
I have an `Instruction` created from `create_account_with_seed`. Now, what account infos do I need to pass to `invoke`? Thank you
Ahh that does actually
ok, i got a better explanation. Metadata is linked to the mint, not to the token. Amount of tokens is just a number inside a token account. tokens don't exists as a entity. there are just mint and token accounts. Does that make sense?
Haha got it. Was just curious, thanks a lot for the replies
this would be the best place for that
https://discord.gg/D9V4gQME
I am having real issues with anchor test after to update to 0.16.2 can anyone help?
aaanyway
https://docs.metaplex.com
because they are not same. they have different art, different description, name , traits ...
You can have 1000 editions but thats 1000 identical copies.
So why not go the 1 mint 1000 supply route? That way you can verify the supply no?
PublicKey has as `toBase58()` method: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/4de5fff3cac148cfcf2bfcb5356040e6698b9a7c/web3.js/src/publickey.ts#L86


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I suggest starting with the token program then 🙂
yep thanks. I am still overwhelmed by these new jargons. slowly studying them 🙂
maybe this? https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getaccountinfo
Check this out - https://spl.solana.com/token and https://docs.metaplex.com/ i think it will help
You would have to build the Signer type by public and private keys but that sounds like a disastrous thing to do
yeah just realize it.
Yes. That's correct. Can do `const { publicKey, connected, sendTransaction } = useWallet();`. But if I use this `publicKey` as the second param, it is also a type mis match. The param expects a `Signer` interface, which is present in `KeyPair` class.
oh
you can obtain the publicKey of the account right?
I see. This is the second step. The first step is to do `let mint = await splToken.Token.createMint(connection, ??, mintAuthority,mintAuthority,0, splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,);`. So I don't know what to replace for `??`. All the examples across web use a randomly generated wallet or a wallet with keypair present in secrets.
I mainly interested to build NFT only though
I am on the same footing as you. I am following the steps provided here: https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold
Although it is for dApps.
yeah but I am not sure.
Hi friends, I'm a brand new developer in this ecosystem.  I'm looking to develop some whacky smart contracts and potentially nfts.  Any great higher level tools out there for Solana?  If not, anyone have a good example I can follow for a new developer?  Thanks everyone!
or something like that
```ts
let fromTokenAccount = await mint.getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo(
    fromWallet.publicKey,
  );
```
Do you mean doing something like `const { wallet } = useWallet();`  and using the `wallet` ? They are both of different types.
on `useWallet()`?
I am trying to write a Typescript function that will mint a token. I want the user to pay for it, while keeping the mint authority to be a constant. I am writing a code like https://gist.github.com/r4881t/a1d53eb9586172acf600096ce54775e9. I am using solana/wallet-adapter to get this done via Wallets. My question is -- how do i get the `Signer` (2nd param of `createMint` function from the wallet conected?
I searched solana docs, couldnt really find any solution for it
and metaplex is the only way to link the asset metadata with the contract ?
hmm interesting. but it sounds a very tedious thing to do.
hehe sorry mate and thanks for clarifing  !
it's not all boys here, no they all are managed by the same contract, but they are represented by different "accounts"
There's some docs here https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/verification.html and some discussion to make a universal/standard docker image for the ecosystem here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/12232.
I guess not. maybe there are 10k accounts 🤔
boys is the solana NFT contract are seperate for each images? if i have a collectible of 10,000 NFTs , there will be individual contract for each of them?
https://anchor.projectserum.com/ like this?
Sorry for the dumb question.
Hi everyone, just to confirm I am not missing something obvious - there is no equivalent of etherscan source code publishing on SOL, correct? (since it's not deterministic?)
its ok I hate types with a passion so we all have our preferences :/
im a horrible JS/TS engineer. i hate it in fact, thats why i love rust so much more
sorry
```Unhandled Rejection (TypeError): this.wallet.signTransaction is not a function``` This is anger inducing
<@!160231074268446720> Gonna follow your video now
yes, almost definitely
This is a very nice use case. Do you think we'll eventually have a token program interface as first mentioned in the interest bearing token proposal?
THanks checking it out.
<@367333864328396800> check the tutorial that i shared with you
ah got it, in this case, `find_program_address` is finding a "program derived address"
the code you shared shows how to create metadata, and it doesn't have any mention of "derived address" so i am a bit lost.
NFT metadata parsing
👍
It would be good to check out this tutorial. It has a nice explanation of PDAs https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/
other people can help too, please don't ping me
<@466984915376799748> sir please explain.
you can replace `mint_account_key` with the mint address of your token: https://github.com/roederw/create-solana-nft-example/blob/f626d23588e74426040b5ef5fb0bba7a9f3b504e/src/main.rs#L176-L182
And send transaction to users wallets?
How can i add  wallet adapter in a wordpress site?
the code I shared shows you how to do it
Hey
okay checking the docs i see that Program derived address: Allow programs to control specific addresses, called program addresses, in such a way that no external user can generate valid transactions with signatures for those addresses.

So how do i get derived address of an account ? I checked on explorer but couldn't find it either.
lmao well the people that already know what they are doing are graduated from past hackathons and actively working on protocols
that's actually demotivating due to imposter syndrome =))
That's too many heros in that. 😂
it'd be a good motivator imo
yall should just join the actual hackathon
I love the idea. Maybe next weekend
nft metadata is stored at a derived address... see here: 
https://github.com/roederw/create-solana-nft-example/blob/f626d23588e74426040b5ef5fb0bba7a9f3b504e/src/main.rs#L176-L182
Can we self organize in to small hackathons? Like 1 or 2 days, and have a showcase end of it. Just for fun and learning
Right. So safemoon and likes will work with only one AMM dex.
Haha. I'm a rust newbie and solana child. I am looking up to you guys tbh
there is a lot of AMMs.... 😛
Please do!
upon calling `connection.getParsedAccountInfo(new web3.PublicKey(` on my nft account pub key i get this data.

There is no clue about the NFT's metadata here.
I don't think it is done yet. <@830948145780752405> is the new Solana God who will be doing this.
Oh me neither. I have never made bank but it will be a good case study
id ask a team that already built it and has it open sourced
I don't like tax token tbh. But admit it, it's an interesting scheme 😄
Lovely!! So the trick will be to call the AMM program with the public method to add to LP? How does one code slippage in?
im not sure if the logic is in safemoon or in bsc tho but I am betting its in the swap program 😛
It would be freaking great. But first I need to learn how to write solana program first 😄 I will DM you when I am ready. And thanks a lot for your offer ❤️
<@!501570363566587905> extending the token program with more functionality is another use-case for https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/issues/454
on each transaction
Yeah you can maybe extend a current  liquidity provider like orca or something and force an 11% slippage and just send the tokens to two differnt places
Ok please ban people and code porting bsc shits in to Solana. Make crypto great again 😂😂
yeah definitely want to look at the above proposal then
ah cool
On the contrary.. It is a tax token, with ability to add to liquidity once a threshold is hit.
Would you like to pair program?
I thought it was just a dumb token (no extra features)
what features does safemoon have?
I am mind reader hahaha
Yeah I am practicing writing spl token program by porting safemoon. Quite an overwhelming task though 😄
docs here: https://docs.metaplex.com/#token-metadata-contract
any idea how to figure out the struct of a NFT project, like sollamas etc ?
yeah but most nft's use metaplex, so they would all be the same
its possible yes
each nft project will have a different struct ?
Are you spying my laptop 🤣
awesome. I feel my IQ increases by 100 after getting a confirmation from you 🤣 
Actually I am learning the solana program and just wonder how it actually works
you cant decode data without knowing the struct of the data in the program, but to answer the question is yes
Omg. You are writing Safemoon for Solana
ha, I think there was a sol tipping bot in the discord at some point
I am not using any NFT library, just building a NFT viewer inside my app. (similar to that on phantom wallet). Is there a neat way to do it without rust in javascript ?
Wen Solana for Dummies?
what kind of features are you adding <@!830948145780752405>
yeah, this is the direction that we think is best for extending token functionality btw: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/15927
nice. free tech support 😄
I love this setup
we're early 🤣
so correct me if I'm wrong: Every spl token uses the same spl-token program but store their data in different accounts. And if I want to extend the token functionality, I need to create an associated token program.
I dont really use any web3 methods and not very familiar but the high level of parsing data is that you need to decode it using the info from the struct in rust or an idl. Anchor abstracts this, but if you want to parse normal data you need to find where the struct is used in Rust or if they have their own wrappers available that handle the decoding. It should be in the github repo of the NFT library you are using.
<@!160231074268446720> do you know how to parse NFT data using the `connection.getParsedAccountInfo` function ?
same
retweeted it cuz I liked it
relevant <@!501570363566587905> tweet: https://twitter.com/armaniferrante/status/1434554725093949452
building on the bleeding edge is always hard 😆
np
thank you
oh that is a nice method
account websocket notifications are sent on a slot granularity so there could be multiple tx's which interacted with your account since the last notification
or just call that whenever you get a websocket notification
got it, for now you can poll https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress and set `until` to the last tx signature you observed
and do an action real time
programatically
just trying to track people who send money to this wallet
why do you want the tx?
```json
{
  "context": {
    "slot": 1234,
    "transactions": ["SCSFQXFEve25Qqyzt1udLXwHDjhThN6a1eXgcAhWWs5ZmukzZAx9Qra4RA2Lj7g6sycxWJYiFj7cin7fG6fJYts"]
  },
}
```
we could put it into context
I'm trying to see that yeah
lol
I see, yeah that would be nice huh
I thought that would show the transaction that triggered the listen
ooo
data bytes = 0
https://explorer.solana.com/address/9R68LygHMLBUyWgGr4UJNTNraBAx7zpAfJhV7WN1VWM6?cluster=devnet
ah well that's because your account has no data
```
$ solana cluster-version -ud
1.7.11
```
you see the empty data
this is response
``` {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"accountNotification","params":{"result":{"context":{"slot":78933353},"value":{"data":["","base58"],"executable":false,"lamports":22089990000,"owner":"11111111111111111111111111111111","rentEpoch":182}},"subscription":177857}}```
hmmm, looks like devnet is running 1.7.11 which is good..
yes sir
<@!330774061787381762> you're using devnet it looks like?
😛
ok confirmed 😛
should be confirmed
wait why processed
with a sleep
otherwise you need to delay it by 13 seconds
everything needs to be commitment processed including creating the account tho
does that look sus to you?
still empty 😦 ``` {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 23486254,
  "method": "accountSubscribe",
  "params": [
    "9R68LygHMLBUyWgGr4UJNTNraBAx7zpAfJhV7WN1VWM6",
    {
      "encoding": "jsonParsed",
      "commitment": "processed"
    }
  ]
}```
v1.7.11 was just released and fixes program subscriptions
websockets can scale
dang, yeah we need to fix that up, rpc polling is so inefficient
All I know is that mango left websockets because their rpc node was losing too much data lol
oh I thought confirmed notifications were fixed already on v1.7
not necessarily, all clusters require fees
> Error: Account <> has insufficient funds for spend (0.45154392 SOL) + fee (0.001435 SOL)
Does this mean I am deploying on mainnet?
but yes the websockets are known buggy atm. They should maybe be fixed in 1.18 solana
try commitment: processed
I’m not getting any data from listening to account
You guys ever use the web sockets ?
well now you have a tutorial i did in under 2 hours to see it in action
I always wanted to see if anchor works in a SPA
tbh
there should be something like provider.wallet
thats why its so hard to work it out
but you can use the wallet from provider
ah right...
its not web3 at this point its anchor ;/
via web3
Hmm.. how would you retrieve it?
so thats my question sir
yeah when you create a provider you need to pass in a wallet
so you're saying I don't have to toss the Wallet in?
walletWrapper is basically an anchor.Wallet object
once you create a new Provider, the wallet is in the provider object
we would need to instantiate an anchor.Provider. How do you obtain the walletWrapper?
Persay a user clicks on 'Pay'
very simple.
recent is deprecated. Its processed now. I dont understand the walletWrapper question
How would you retrieve a walletWrapper in web3?
```const provider = new anchor.Provider(solConnection, walletWrapper, {
            preflightCommitment: 'recent',
        });```

Moving along..
Understood . Thanks!!
sheesh. there's a lot of missing dependencies on Debian WSL
Is this even the right place to ask?
one issue that will arise is that there is a lack of standardization in the token space. Hopefully there will be a standard like anchor's idl, but right now most people just make a big json and match the public keys with the metadata in that json
If you are expecting people to use this on a browser the standard work flow is you do an rpc call that fetches all the data you need and then display / categorize it. The user will then be able to interact with that data and you can write rpc calls to send instructions to the solana program. You dont have to worry about signing transactions or mutating data except for display reasons. The wallet takes care of the first and the solana program should take care of the latter
browser
this doesnt seem related to your wallet problem. Are you expecting users to use this in a CLI or on the browser
yeah not sure why we download there haha
ohh thank you! I was looking on some system dirs 🤦🏼‍♂️
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/928bb764ed9c15e7978763b2a182e99c7481a5f5/associated-token-account/program/src/processor.rs#L97
So i may have to accept both tokens (Fungible and non-fung)
thats the problem i got
and i'm trying to research ways to accept any token as payment
you shouldnt have to do anything except prompt the user to conenct to the wallet
well funny thing about us, we're building solana indexers
Would you mind kindly drop me a code snippet please?
?*
via oyster/
you can invoke the system transfer instruction in your program
I am not sure what you are trying to do but if you load up a wallet on the browser and make a solana transaction it will handle the sign transaction within the wallet
Hi, please let me know how to move lamports from user signed account to other account in solana program. Is there any specific command or function which can be used?
hey, I just looked at this and to fix you can remove the tar file that's downloaded into the dir of the program you're trying to build. Once you remove it, try running cargo build-bpf again. We'll get this patched up, thanks!
I'm not doing it right
but i think
yes..
no a browser wallet will sign the transaction with a popup unless you have enabled auto signing
still damn confused, wouldn't the standard wallet have a signTransaction function anyway?
this is the problem im getting
<@&439193425397415936>
×
Unhandled Rejection (TypeError): this.wallet.signTransaction is not a function
shoudl I try test net?
Is this a bug in the devnet?
Hi All @here,
Can anybody give me some direction on any example for simulating tokenomics of pools ? if that makes sense.
has anyone ever seen this? do I need to specify scope somewhere
Hi im new here...are there any Non-coding job profiles in blockchain industry??
for some reason the data is always empty

Armani has asample?!
oh boyu
Its called NodeWallet because its supposed to be a NodeWallet :/ A lot of people get tripped up about this. You arent the first. I would just follow how its done in the example. I legit copy and pasted that from Armani's swap example
is there a way to convert a Anchor Wallet to a Anchor NodeWallet?
So heres the thing
its ok I am a NFT sheep -- but i havent touched metaplex yet
any ideas?

dont ask me to 'as any'
i beg u
PLEASE
bro
its still in alpha
ah.
ok Anchor has a lot of type issues that are confusing and being worked out
Fyi, doing something related to DeFi.. don't worry im not one of those NFT sheps
```export interface MintButtonProps {
    userWalletPubKey: anchor.web3.PublicKey;
    walletWrapper: anchor.Wallet;
}```
thats the problem.
I declared it that the component is taking in an anchor.Wallet object. But the thing is, it keeps making noise about me using an anchor.Wallet instead of a NodeWallet
Basically, I'm doing something similar to the youtube video you've shared! Great info thanks. But I'm trying to pass a 'wallet' from 'useWallet()' into my other react component
Apologies
I dont get what you are asking but there are multiple methods in web3 that allow you to interact with a deployed program. Some would argue, most of them
i dont understand this. When you deploy anchor it accepts parameters from an rpc request. It doent matter if its from a browser or python or rust. If you are asking for an example of how to set up a browser with a deployed anchor program I have a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p_8549sinc
I might still try my last hope in my current setup, otherwise, I will resort to just set this up on Mac
cool. thanks for suggestion.
its nice to be able to have a 1gb/internet connection everywhere :p
a really fun dev hack is to buy a $50/month linux server and just code on it and enjoy hvaing super fast internet and tons of ram
I'm using WSL Debian/Ubuntu but I'm encountering a lot of issues
mac or linux
how about the OS?
i like vscode and localnet :p
Thanks! So what i'm confused about is, if the anchorProgram has an rpc-based mint function, that seems to be unusable for browser env. Was looking for examples where i can send a tx signing request to the wallet adapter
In which environment do you guys recommend to develop on Solana?
is it possible to call programs via web3?
for anchor, i think you should just be able to cast or add implements onto the Base WalletAdapter from wallet-adapter src.  they should be using the same overall interface definitions, sign and signAll transaction. the only thing missing in the Base wallet might be publicKey. It should be compatible though from what I remember about anchor provider.
hopefully it wont ne that hard hehe
will look into it. thinking about building a multisender dapp for starters. just to learn the basics :/
great, thanks!
basically how to call an arbitrary program? in this case, metaplex's metadata program `metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s`
Couldn't seem to find any API's or structures that could return a Wallet of that type
Greetings, just wondering if anyone had any luck with obtain an anchor.Wallet from the react-based wallet-adapter?
hello. I am trying to work my way around calling a custom contract via web3
Great, thanks!!
the first three here are great: https://solana.com/developers  figment pathway is a great starter, intro to programming is a great more in depth tutorial, and anchor is a framework with a lot of tools on top of Solana,
in a program, you can check against whatever is sent into the transaction. and all data should be passed into the transaction. there is an .owner property you can check to see if the program is the owner, and you can check authority to do validation as well. anchor framework has some built in constraint like checks, similar to what solidity has.
the programId is the program address, so if you are interacting with it, you probably know the address
yeah of course, I just wanted to know if I could get an aproximation of how many solanas I will need in the mainnet to do everything I need
also you can use `solana-keygen recover 'prompt:?key=0/0'` to retrieve your private key via mnemonic phrase if you want.
Thanks!
Hi <@!168868665456984065> I called the getAccountInfo and it is returning me this data, can you guide me how to use this object to get NFT metadata
```
{
  context: { slot: 95075479 },
  value: {
    data: <Buffer >,
    executable: false,
    lamports: 487920721,
    owner: PublicKey { _bn: <BN: 0> },
    rentEpoch: 219
  }
}
```
the keypair.json is just a byte array. if you have a base58 encoded private, you can decode it and fill it into a same format file.
Does anyone know how to install bpf-tools in WSL?
o/
the fees are the same. but devnet sol is not "real" sol. you can simply get it by an airdrop.
you can take a look at https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#configuring-state-commitment for commitment
What string is it, do you know ?
you just pass it in i think
commitment is just a string
I am trying to use connection.getAccountInfo(pubkey, commitment) 
How do i generate commitment for calling this function ?
It's when the transaction has finalised
I know it's an array of numbers, so I decoded bs58 from the string pk, then that looked like hex so I decoded that to decimal but apparently that isn't right
Can someone explain what web3 committment means and how to get it  https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#commitment
Can someone tell me what's in a keypair.json file? Trying to convert a base58 encoded private key from phantom to use as a signer with the solana cli
i found this for now
https://solana.com/news/getting-started-with-solana-development

if anyone has something else and useful, it would be much apperciated
can u point me to some tutorial for beginner developers on solana?
hey guys... id like to write multisender app for tokens on solana
Hi! are fees similar in devnet to mainnet? The fees of creating token / minting / account etc
Contract*
How do i find a programId of a program I'm interacting with?
Have a very dumb question
Doesn't that inflate the currency (SOL) ?
Oh okay so it's just the fees to mint? Then once you have that you can operate it on your dapp right?
What's the Solana equivalent of `OnlyOwner()` type checks used in Solidity?
I used `@solana/wallet-adapter`, and in official example, `useWallet()` expose `publicKey, sendTransaction`.
How do I use `useWallet()` to retrieve public key list (token list) after connecting to wallet?
Thanks you 👍 💯
if you intend to develop or build NFTs yes. the best NFT resource is metaplex: https://www.metaplex.com/, the source code: https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex, the dev guide: https://docs.metaplex.com/.  

additional resources for NFT metadata: 
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/rust/token-metadata/program/README.md
https://github.com/roederw/create-solana-nft-example
candy machine: NFT: metaplex: https://hackmd.io/@levicook/HJcDneEWF

non developer, or a no code required NFT options is here: https://www.holaplex.com/.
How should a user protect himself from evil programs ?
On ethereum it is pretty straightforward. You know how much you are sending into a contract. Therefore you know how much exactly you are risking.
On solana it is different because you give write permission on your account to a program. How to be certain that it will not take your full account balance instead of just a few solana as it advertises ? Having an account with just the right amount of Solana is a solution but it is not user friendly at all.
Hi
I'm new in solana
Do I need contract to build NFT ?
for example if I want to create something like cryptopunk on solana what I need ?
I create NFT on eth but I like to work in solana
@ https://solana.com/developers, the first 3 listed are great. I would start with figment learn pathway for an end to end basics using Solana, and build on that with the paulx blog: Intro to Programming on Solana where it goes more in depth. Then intro to Anchor is great for introducing you to the anchor framework and has a lot of great examples. From there I would cherry pick resources based on where you want to go.
fastest is to just turn the data you got in the explorer from base64 to utf8 string. thats should give you some insight..
you need enough sol to run the transaction for create mint and create token account. very small amounts.
as a standalone library?
anyone managed to successfully strip the metadata creation out of the metaplex project?
Oh okay. So you need to have a minimum buy-in to be able to launch your own project?
I dont remember. But you can use test net to know the amount.
Hi guys, I just had a question. If an SPL token is created is there a minimum amount of SOL that you need to own?
I will take a look at this project. Many thanks!
Please, can someone send an example of how the metadata of a metaplex nft is deserialized by knowing the mint address?
Thanks for the reply. Got a quick followup -- I'm using the explorer and I got the point where I can retrieve the instruction data. How would I deserialize the instruction data?
Hi all. I'm interested in Solana NFT. I've already tried to create wallet, make token, make NFT, add logo, name token,...

But I'm stuck at how to attach media file.
Let say I created 1 NFT token. How can I attach Medial file to it? Make it become true NFT art?

Can it be done with CLI-tools? Or I have to deal with smart contract and rust?

Thanks!
Thanks for the response : )
It is a PDA, I am sending the seed in the instruction_data parameter with the help of borsh crate can I assume that is working?
https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs
how much storage do i need for the node?
thanks a lot🙏
guys, sorry but this thing is driving me out, how it's possible to see if the price showed on marketplaces such as Solanart or DigitalEyes is the actual price asked for that nft on the blockchain? is it possibly related to the data of the escrow account?  how could I decode those data?
if you are a beginner, I recommend you mint your fungible token first 
https://spl.solana.com/token
then https://docs.metaplex.com/ to realize more about NFT.
you can use `solana-test-validator` to host a local node.
if your talking about NFT, I don't think the official explorer support you to do that.
but you still can find the metadata and parse it to get what you want
here is the doc https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard#token-metadata-program
not sure EsqyfiNWeB1o181Fxf4BakgSWzhNpPMWi7zrfv6yQHFa is a PDA or not
if it is PDA, check your seed you provides to invoke_signed, the different seeds will derive a different PDA
it it is not a PDA, please use this account to sign this tx before you send it.
I'm a  beginner at Solana but wanna mint NFT by myself. How can I do that, is there any document for that?
Hi All, very glad to see the consolidated https://solana.com/developers list of resources to get started as a new dev. Given there is a lot there, what would you recommend first? Intro to Programming on Solana walkthrough? or a particular video/course perhaps? Thanks.
quick question guys can i run solana node just for my project only to access data faster. No need for validator just rpc node locally next to my project
Thanks 🙏
seems to be a big obstacle to testing anything time based properly
Is there still no way to control the Clock in a  program test?
How do I go from viewing a token on explorer to finding the underlying asset (image) associated with it?

    )?;
```
What is wrong here?
Guys
im not sure why an owner would not be listed, perhaps the program derived portion. that may be the cause for getAccountInfo returning none. part of your parsing involves getaccountinfo it appears, is all your trying to do is get the spl tokens for an account?  or is there more to it
yup
'9dq2RqH3qSyEerMHS4fS9tsYNLTz1HE5jM4CskDJ1WmS' was found as the destination of an innerInstruction and my script parses to find out what tokenAddress the spl account address holds
so a program derived account?
im parsing signatures created by a program id
hmm. this is odd. is this your account or what are you trying to figure out or accomplish?
the value im trying to find is `AqxA3DGtwRX3roAU2iDvxX9977Apd6JSomPmTwA7FsoS` which is the tokenAddress of the token that the previous wallet address, `9dq2RqH3qSyEerMHS4fS9tsYNLTz1HE5jM4CskDJ1WmS`, holds
if i remember correctly there are two different types of spl accounts? (saber i believe helped accounts switch over?) does this have something to do with that phenomenon
`def getAccountInfo(address):
    rpc={"jsonrpc":"2.0", 
         "id":1, 
         "method":"getAccountInfo", 
         "params": [address, 
                   ]}
    supply=requests.post("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com",headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"},data=json.dumps(rpc))
    return supply.json()`

`getAccountInfo('9dq2RqH3qSyEerMHS4fS9tsYNLTz1HE5jM4CskDJ1WmS')`

returns
`
{'jsonrpc': '2.0',
 'result': {'context': {'slot': 95017075}, 'value': None},
 'id': 1}`
solana_client.get_account_info('9dq2RqH3qSyEerMHS4fS9tsYNLTz1HE5jM4CskDJ1WmS') is the python client call, but i can reproduce it using requests and the rpc directly too
when holding spl tokens
typically i believe i see these as having parent accounts
its weird that the page shows it without an account owner, and the spl tokens tab shows spl token transactions
https://solscan.io/account/9dq2RqH3qSyEerMHS4fS9tsYNLTz1HE5jM4CskDJ1WmS
same network?  how are you querying?
9dq2RqH3qSyEerMHS4fS9tsYNLTz1HE5jM4CskDJ1WmS appears to be a valid accountaddress based on solscan, but getAccountInfo returns 

`{'jsonrpc': '2.0',
 'result': {'context': {'slot': 95016081}, 'value': None},
 'id': 5}`

from the RPC, is there an explanation as to why this could happen
this may help: https://github.com/roederw/create-solana-nft-example  also the metaplex discord is very helpful. and the chat history has a lot of good info to search on. https://discord.com/channels/848060988636921856/848060988636921859
Is here any documentation or someone who knows how to link an asset (image) to a solana nft recently created

I wrote some code to get NFT account data from a given address. Its given me this data (attached), does anyone know how to get the actual NFT metadata ?

is there any docs to build own spl-token tipbot on Discord? thank you!
Creating an nft and minting it is well documented on the dev docs, but how can you add metadata to the newly minted nft, I’d appreciate if someone point me in the right documentation for that.
anyone ever get these errors when running `cargo build` on the solana repo? been at this for hours😩
amazing! thank you
no

Are all smart contracts on solana written with anchor?
https://githubmemory.com/repo/project-serum/spl-token-wallet/issues/247
all good
sorry last comment was dumb i dont think that should matter lol
yeah I sent sol to it and am doing transactions
that is bizarre. Are you sure you generated the wallet on main net?
and gets the right account, but not when using a web wallet
the seed phrase to recover the keypair works in the cli
yeah, so basically the seed phrase given to me when the wallet was generated doesnt restore the wallet when using sollet or phantom
have you tried solana-keygen --help
I can only get the binary version
okay more general then how do i get my memonic phrase via cli
this is a phantom related question so I would ask in their discord, but almost all wallets have a way to import keys / phrases
how do I import a wallet made from the CLI into like phantom?
hmm. okay i will take a look
no i dont think that is correct
oh i think i've heard of this actually. but you can only auction NFTs on there right?
https://discord.gg/bQtjMpBP its some deployed nft program you can interact with that handles a bunch of the complexity
not sure what metaplex is 😂😂
I dont think this is a solana program though its jsut a rust example showing how to interact with metaplex. You could probably rewrite everything into pure web3 if you wanted
ah i see. yeah just looking to make an nft series so im pretty sure web3 is the way to go about that
-.- this is hard for me to answer because I dont really use the web3 library anymore -.-
okay thanks
I built a simple voting platform based off some of smith's code https://smith-mcf.medium.com/a-simple-solana-dapp-tutorial-6dedbdf65444. Solana is pretty complicated so just take it slow. I would really recommend using anchor because it simplifies a lot of solana's gotchas though.
so is this something that would get deployed and then you would use web3 to connect to the contract and mint?
what resources did you use? im having trouble getting started here
gotta just dive in
hehe
yeah for sure
problem is ETH gas fees are too high so solana is the better option'
yeah but solana is better
yeah the lack of examples really makes it hard to develop with solana. i want to use solana but i can make an ETH smart contract and deploy it in 10 minutes
https://github.com/roederw/create-solana-nft-example maybe this repo will help.
tthat's what I though
nice
yes
oh you mean in solana?
lol yeah for sure
if you do its a big bug
but I just want to make sure
``` Restrictions#
On-chain Rust programs support most of Rust's libstd, libcore, and liballoc, as well as many 3rd party crates.

There are some limitations since these programs run in a resource-constrained, single-threaded environment, and must be deterministic:```
I read this in documentation
do I need to worry about race conditions in solana?
so I'm thinking of keeping a data strucutre of all the NFTS in the program then grabing from the list, minting then removing. I'm wondering how I can make sure the data strucuture is synchronized though
I'm writing one right ow
I coulnd't find anything good
Hey all. I am familiar with solidity and have written multiple smart contracts on the ETH blockchain but I am looking to dive into the world of solana. However, I am finding it extremely difficult to find a proper end to end tutorial for deploying an NFT smart contract and creating a mint site. All the guides i have seen, create the NFT through CLI which is not easy to do when you want to mint several thousand. If anyone have any advice or is able to clear some of my confusion, please let me know. even willing to pay if someone can help. thanks!
is there a limit to the amount of account meta I can send with the transaction to my program? It seems that as soon as I add more than 6 my transaction doesnt proceed
any ideas?
was with v1.7.11 and 1.6
this was happening in another project so i decided to just see if i could build solana repo without this error

hey guys ive been trying to `cargo build` solana repo but i get `could not compile "solana-frozen-abi-macro"`
Any one has any thoughts>
I feel like I have shaky foundation and trying to find tutorials related to this area
Any suggestion on best tutorials to work on to learn how to accept sol from another wallet, convert sol to another asset ( UST) and deposit it in a program?
full error + proof of account balance
am I suppose to do something to init the account?
but the account has Sol in it
hey guys I am attempting to run some code to mint an nft on solana when I load my wallet into javascript and call SystemProgram.transfer I recieve the error Transaction simulation failed: Attempt to debit an account but found no record of a prior credit.
I think this is what we need. 

getconfirmedsignaturesforaddress2
getconfirmedtransaction
probably a bit of a dumb question, but I've deployed a program and can see it properly deployed but how do I actually _call_ the program now?
Yeah, ty
so its 10000 mint accounts, 10000 token accounts, 10000 pda metadata accounts ,10000 mastereditions.
well , that would mean 10000 different metadatas.
That’s wrong thoughts, yes?
Coz I was thinking maybe you can make in one minting transaction more than one NFT
Okay
this is one minting transaction.
as you can see in account inputs and balances, it cost around 0,0114 sol
I think i would need to get all transactions then get fees from there but not sure what rpc endpoints i need to hit for it
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4WY8bCfSDQUqBSyYnYq4NS5bgkkdeuRat6wQ1Sy6hcYUfyMSvZUid2wiiVHE9Wb2MckF7PvEvnJE4C4D8hvvKXEP
what api calls should I be using to get how many fees an address has paid in their lifetime?
oh gotchu
It is already created, you need just to switch your net in settings
Ye?
But you said 1$ for mint, so i understand that you can pay less
So if I want to make 10.000 NFT’s I need to pay 10.000$ ? Or I can somehow decrease amount?
how can I create an address on devnet?
yes.
no, they are separate clusters.
1$ for minting 1 NFT, yes?
currently its around 1$ to mint. calling create metadata + createMasterEdition.
I'm trying the following 


> from solana.rpc.api import Client
> >>> http_client = Client("https://api.devnet.solana.com")
> >>> http_client.get_account_info(PublicKey('my_key_here'))
does devnet endpoint contain all the data from the mainnet?
Hi, If I make one NFT, Solana is charging me with the fee for transaction.
Can I create 1000 different NFT tokens and pay fee only once? Or for new NFT token I have to pay fee again and again
How do I export my Solana wallet to a .json file?
I know there is a standard, I am saying it would be good to have a standards body. This https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_organization 🙂
Please where can I see new listed tokens on solscan
Hi
Seems like it
ty also!
ty this was super helpful, i think its actually a bug im running into!! but yessss decodeMessage is exactly where it goes wrong for me
https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard
Taking a look at this today, got presigner error. One of the signing addresses hasn't been used before, so I'm waiting on another member to resign. I may try creating a new one with each member individually to see if one of them are having problems. If that fails I'll set up paper wallets and distribute to the team as a backup
So the only way of having NFT with metadata is using metaplex?
if you dont have the instructions layout , then no. instruction is constructed from program id, accounts array and data. for almost every spl program first byte in the data is the instruction. anchor has its own thing, and for everything else if you don't have the source...
true
this is what i needed
people do that with types also ,😋
or keep it ts
holy! thank you!
strip away the types and come back here to ask question about every single line failing 😄
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/0ba4954762c8ad7a7802cbb03268fce5de932b40/js/packages/common/src/actions/metadata.ts#L536
almost anyone could just take metadata.tx in js/packages/common/actions ( just from my head ) and strip away the types and boom you have your js lib.
unless i missed in the library
the metadata part does not yet exist in js/ts
not the metadata part
unless you talking about the example that'd being shared around. 
minting on metaplex is done in typescript calling the programs as any other solana dapp.
its not.
😆
or alternatively is there a good way of getting the instruction layout from a frontend?
does anyone have a good way of implying what a transaction is when you don't have the instructions layout (for a specific owner)? For example I can manually lookup a bunch of transactions and see what they are. After that I want to put them in buckets together. Right now I'm counting the number of instructions and account keys, but it doesn't feel very robust
/rant over sorry
rust is like c, made for engines...
and that is annoying 😦
its super easy to create an NFT token or otherwise just a token on Solana, but adding meta data to it you are pretty much forced to use metaplex, and they wrote it all in Rust
sucks
ok so metaplex the "minting and nft process" is all written in rust...
Is there support for Python solana library on Discord?
Anyone got an anchor example of a program calling the create_account() instruction of system_program ? (I'm struggling)
I have a doubt regarding token listing. Since an NFT is an SPL token, do we have to list all the NFTs individually on the Spl-token-list GitHub repo for making it recognisable?
Wouldn't hurt to have a standards body for NFTs. A standard is definitely needed so that it doesn't become a mess to support various implementations, but idk that the metaplex way is the best way. 🤷‍♀️
Figured it out... Forgot to set the default keypair!
Any hints on what to try?
Trying to use the spl-token cli, but running into an issue:
So you can extend on top of spl token  program ? Like modifying and do some things on transfer?
Rent fees are just deducted from the account's balance, they aren't charged on a per tx basis
Most programs require accounts to be "rent exempt", including the spl token program. So any custom tokens using that program won't be at risk of going to 0. But if the token program didn't have that restriction, the token would disappear, yes
not too bad, just storing the name, symbol, and uri
<@!466984915376799748> Let me ask you something. If someone makes a custom token and the rent budget goes to 0 the token basically disappears ? But you could charge a rent fee on transactions ?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

NFTs are part of the Solana token program (https://spl.solana.com/token). The equivalent to Ethereum ERC-20 is called SLP Token (https://spl.solana.com/token). Smart Contracts are used mostly for Dapps (which use Rust)
how are you still doing everyone tags in every discord asking about the most basic stuff, can you seriously not just ask without pinging everyone first
does someone know how to send a NFT to an adress using solana-cli? On the official doc, I only see the command to send sol and not a nft token
Status page says its operational but clearly something's down
I guess so
Is DevNet down? I can't airdrop anything
Hello everybody. I have learned I can create PDA with this line:  
let (pda, _bump_seed) = Pubkey::find_program_address(&[b"lootbox"], program_id);
Here pda is a public key. 
Please let me know how can I generate or get AccountInfo from this pda variable.
Thank you.

Yeah, to show logs, I will need to have at least 10 sol
Hey anyone else having trouble airdropping on devnet?
Hey guys, anybody knows how to have the same wallet on phantom wallet and solana cli please??
I can of course dig into their code etc. but if there's any tutorial so I can build a quick internal demo for a tool we're considering that'd be helpful
Has anyone seen a good guide on interacting with raydium (and the other dexes in the ecosystem) in your own project. E.g. get prices directly to pass to your backend (or less importantly place orders)?
yep that's what I was looking for, thank you!
Can you say more about what config is missing?
Thanks. I noticed this as well
ok, so looks like part of my problem was using wrong decimals for USDC. all iterations work with my KEYS test in production. We'll go back and test again with both of the team multisigs that we have and hopefully close this out.
it was both honestly didn't know which one
nice thanks

Can anyone point me in the right direction if I wanted to interact with a smart contract on the chain directly?
ah weird, it was working yesterday but you're right. it seems to fail now
hey team. I am a bit confused. I have been using the getFeeCalculatorForBlockhash fn using the `https://solana-mainnet.phantom.tech` endpoint, from that I get an expected response. when I switch the URL tohttps://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com  I get an error saying WrongSize with the same body

I think I am confused on which client I should be using when trying to retrieve transaction data
Been scratching my head for a while, I'm just running through a Solana tutorial and I'm struggling to build my project with `cargo build-bpf` , a regular `cargo build` succeeds - I'm running into:

```

```
Anyone seen this before? I'm on MacOS
Another way would be to transfer the token to a new devnet wallet created by phantom. But the solana CLI doc doesn't explain how to do that
If I mint a token on devnet with a solana key (in json format), How can I view it? I would like to import my private key to phantom, but the secret.json is not compatible with the expected private key format of Phantom
yeah but the faucet is empty on the cli
command line tools have a `solana airdrop` function that works in devnet.
any help very much appreciated !
Hi all, is there any way to batch/stream an RPC call ? for example getProgramAccounts if I ask for all the tokens I get a string that is too large (unsurprisingly)
any others?

wrong channel though really
how about the second question?
np
okay, thanks
so not like Ethereum 🤡
the fee will be like $0.00075 though
the sender pays the transaction fee to send a token
similar question; does it cost transaction fee when mutating internal data of a program owned account? if so, who pays for it?
is there transaction fee for spl token transfer? if there is, who pays for it?

start with a new ledger
Hey all! I'm new to Solana. I'm following the docs on the CLI, I've been able to generate and verify my keypair, and I've set my RPC to the devnet (https://api.devnet.solana.com) but when running:
```bash
solana airdrop 1 MY_PUB_KEY
# also tried with --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

I get a timeout:
```
Requesting airdrop of 1 SOL
Error: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds
```

Is there something I'm missing?

<@!401880349166141441> : Actual dev question. How can I programmatically access the data stored on an account?
Hey guys, what's the best way to mint a whole collection of 10,000 NFT's on Solana network?
ok ty
candy machine is a week old. you can ask more on metaplex discord.
<@!401880349166141441> I am trying to use the Metaplex website but I don't understand how I can use the Candy thing you talked about?
maybe you should look into multisigner accounts. didnt use it yet. you can read more about it @ https://spl.solana.com/token
<@!401880349166141441> could you advise on what would be the standard procedure for a program that needs two signer accounts?
Buffer right?
about the data field, what type does it accept?
interesting,
You create create an Instruction and then a Transaction, sign it with your account and send it to the chain
https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/master/src/client/hello_world.ts#L211
lemme check
oh
Look at the client
https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld
how to call it
like support I deployed a program on the chain
a simple question, how, to interact with on-chain programs?
How can I read the raw data from an account?
metaplex works fine for most nft drops
what do you want to change about it?
why would you want to isolate the contract?
im doing fine
https://gist.github.com/dahifi/2d862e6ff45ca2f3cada888c451113e6
I'll upload my script as a gist
what's strange is that I can do all three using online signing from a single device, but it fails for offline signing
1 3 4 works
2 3 4 fails
3 4 5 works
anyway thx guys
if u want
well u can add me and ill let u know if i find anything
gotcha
oh
Try and look yourself, that's what I'm trying to do.
I don't know man.
basically
without the storefront
like im trying to isolate the contract so i can work on that
and the contract code is on metaplex also?
ok
So the contract they already deployed handles all the metaplex NFTs.
I think.
Then the storefront interacts with it.
It is deployed.
If I'm write in my understanding, they deploy the contract.
<@!585868308419444749> just did a bunch of tests with the following key derivations: 

```
KEYS[1]="usb://ledger"
KEYS[2]="usb://ledger?key=1"
KEYS[3]="usb://ledger?key=1/0"
KEYS[4]="usb://ledger?key=1/1"
KEYS[5]="usb://ledger?key=1/2"
```
Looks like number 2 doesn't work. This seems to be our problem as one of our team used this path for their address.
its kinda overwhelming rn
without the store
<@!401880349166141441> is there a way i can jus get the smart contract portion of this metaplex easily?
that image confused me
ye ok thats whati thought
metamask is an ethereum wallet
lol
ok nvm
o
i mean i should probably change but im curious
no...
cuz ive integrated with metamask already
wait solana can use metamask?
look for wallet-adaptor
i dont know how to make the contract
Is there any available source code for this connect wallet things?
what about the contract
I'm new though so I very well could be wrong.
ok
No need to disassemble it.
To my knowledge, you can just make your website interact with their program.
You don't need to disassemble and reassemble.
You can use it on your own website.
jus wanna swap
cuz i got my website and everything running for eth
so id need to disassemble and reassemble but its still the framework i should use
oh ok
that storefront is just a ready made implementation, done to make life easy for artists that don't code. At least that was their intention. It can be ripped apart and web part done differently. The main stuff are the deployed programs.
I would eventually like to learn how to do it but right now, premade programs is the best route for me
taking the time to learn how to do the first bit will take a while and i'm pushed for time
is there a way I can do it with no rust coding?
hmm
sorry for ignorance, but i promise you ive tried to find this info
on the repo everything is talking about making a store front there
im kind of all over the place
is ther a good way to navigate the docs towards that
yeah
kind like solsouls today
Or make a escrow account  ( maybe that would need some custom rust coding, maybe not ) , on which the fees for the holders are gathered and exchanged for the NFT.
im curious if i want to do only the mint button, is metaplex still the place to go?
gotcha
oh u were talking to him
<@!401880349166141441>
more @ https://docs.metaplex.com/ .
Metaplex has four programs : metadata, vault, auction and metaplex.
it jus came out
i didnt expect it
we're in the same boat here brutha
hahaha
only because you said 'shindig' lol
lol i jus got laughed at
What is the Vault program?
Probably the vault program.
like the whole shindig
do any of u guys know a good metaplex tutorial
What would I combine it with?
ok 2.5 im guessing
I'm not sure but this is 15% because it all goes to holders and minters.
I think the Apes had 2,5%
for 10000 avatar project what is usual royalties?
Right.
No. The holders part is where you have to combine it with something else.
Can I do **this** with Metaplex?
I want to make it so that the money from that 15% royalty is given to the holders and minters. 15% to minters, 85% to holders.
Now here is the key part.
Okay.
Yes.
Can I do this with Metaplex?
Now I want to make it so that there is a 15% royalty on all meerkats.
Ah okay, yeah that's good.
Fill it with 9999 mercats. User pay for one.
What's a "candy machine"?
Yes, they have a "candy machine" now.
The thing is to use existing programs as lego bricks.
So, I'm a little confused about how to do it.
My NFT project is a project of 9,999 meerkat profile pictures, each of which are unique.
Can I do this part with metaplex?
Okay.
Don't worry about that.
Maybe we should move to direct messages so we don't clog this channel?
You can code in js bindings.
But wouldn't I have to code?
Maybe you can combine it with a stake pool.
Maybe a Program can be developed where the royalties get sent to and then the Program can distribute?
Then the people who I split off to have to trust me, no?
If that is to little for you, make a account for splitting downstream as one of the creators.
The part that makes my NFT project "different" is the fact that the people who mint get 15% of all secondary-market royalties and the holders get 85%.
Hmm.
Metadata program has a array of max 5 creators with their shares.
Will metaplex let me make it so that holders and minters get a percentage of the royalties?
have a look at metaplex
Sorry 😅
What do you mean by "current metadata program"?
The secondary-market royalties should be split between the holders and minters.
That is already a part of current metadata program.
I want to create an NFT project on Solana with secondary-market royalties.
I'll tell you what I'm trying to achieve.
What do you mean?
Hmm
Maybe you dont need to struggle. Maybe you just dont need a custom program deployment.
Maybe I should learn Rust basics and syntax and then come to trying to integrate that knowledge with Solana?
I'm just struggling with the syntax of it.
Thats ok. But you have to ask yourself what would you do differently than the current metadata program? What functionality are you missing?
Furthermore, which course would you recommend for doing the program side? I see so much documentation on the frontend part but I'm trying to focus on the backend right now.
I guess I'll have to learn how to use Rust. Would you recommend learning Rust basics and then coming to Solana and trying to learn the Solana side of it or would you say it's best to do it in one smooth move? 😄
What about Solang? <@!489206164270350337>
Okay.
Neon labs is creating something that allows you to use solidity to write programs, but that is not available on the mainnet just yet. If Rust is causing some difficulty, I heard using Anchor helps out a lot. Currently programs are only supported by C and Rust
I've seen Solang so maybe someone could let me know if that's a good idea to use.
Is there any way that I can use Solidity? If not, can I use Python?
I'd love to try to create a simple NFT program on Solana. However, I am really not vibing with Rust.
Hey everyone. I recently spent the time to learn Solidity but I have come to love the Solana blockchain over the last few days.
what would be the process to get my program sent signed accounts from both my wallet and the client's wallet? As far as I can see the wallet provider signs the transaction and gets sent to the blockchain, is it possible that once the client signs with the wallet providers the transaction gets sent my way to add my signature? So far I have been developing everything with local wallets but now that I think about a real scenario I am not sure how it would work.
Thank you!
it all comes to https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api .
web3, golang, c#, rust.. it doesn't matter. they all use rpc clients.
<@!401880349166141441>  Thanks! can web3 solana frontend can read any account with data layout, too?
what I'm trying to say is you can read any account if you know its data layout. Just the owner program can write.
yes, other programs can read.
<@!401880349166141441> There is a number that I want to get from the A program, so I made an instruction (A program) that gets that number from other program and writes to state account. Is it right? Can the others read the number in A program?
you are correct. if you made a custom program with a custom transfer function, your function would not be called by AMM or DEXs.
what do you mean by state function?
instructions can write logs.  you emmit transactions. then after a brief time you can query for the transactions comfirmation. transactions write to accounts, you query the accounts.
<@!829214948060168267> Can instructions return other values like integer or string?
you interact with the program with transactions
sure. I can implement this functionality. The only problem is that the user needs to interact with my smart contract. So, by doing regular transactions my business logic that I want to run on each and every transaction would not be applied outside of my smart contract.
ok
yes they do everything. look for metaplex cli in js folder
sorry if im asking a lot ive been really stuck
no idea other than coding in rust/cpp. lol
does metaplex walk me through the contract creation at all?
if you are using metaplex you will have to do it when upload to ipfs then attach the link to the ipfs
I have it in ethereum and I am interested in porting the code to solana contract, but im struggling to find docs on it
so, theoretically I would need either native support for that functionality on the Token Program or I need to create a wallet that is not communicating on the Token Program's Id, right? Because that's what Wallets are doing I assume: Using the Token Program by referencing its id and identify the SPL token by its mint address?
the metadata
hi I was curious if anyone could help me. I wanna know how to attach ipfs link to my nft
doubt it. you will need to code the program to apply fees and taxes.
it does so while sending transactions I believe
hey guys, is it possible to hook into a token transaction process? As I understood whenever I transact a SPL token it's routed through the already available On-ChainToken Program. By that, I can not provide custom code, e.g. apply taxes / fees, let transaction fail, etc.
Quick question: Can solana web3 call program's state function directly?
ohhhh
the data
it is transfered with TransactionInstructions
interesting,
you need a program
yes
the only way is through the metaplex program?
so there isn't any option to set it during the cli?
in metaplex is it 'metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s'
but it did not attach metadata to the mint. it is usually sent as a transaction to metada progam ID
it is minting
all this time I thought the

spl-token mint <TOKEN> 1 <ACCOUNT>

was "minting"
can you give an example?
but you need to attach data when minting as well. I think that is primitive
nothing wrong
am I doing it wrong?
all through cli
like:

spl-token create-token --decimals 0
spl-token create-account <TOKEN>
spl-token mint <TOKEN> 1 <ACCOUNT>
spl-token authorize <TOKEN> mint --disable
so how I am doing right now is using cli to make a token
I'm a bit confused
yes, using metaplex though right?
<@!845612968686125066> maybe I can provide u help on this
are you referring to the command spl-token mint on the cli?
on minting
storage cost is about 10 lamports
hold up, hold up, minting
you upload it to arweave with your transaction
when you mint you have to supply a link of the nft, usually an arweave link.
like, on it's data field?
indeed, but how would it be linked with the token,
and json file with name, description, etc
yes it is where the nft jpeg is stored
arweave?
arweave*
arweave(
yes, when you upload to airweave
some NFT marketplaces also seems to require it
and it was noticed that tokens require metadatas to be enlisted as NFTs on Phantom
on integrating phantom wallet
I was reading through https://docs.phantom.app/integrating/tokens/non-fungible-tokens#token-metadata-program
I don't know if there are methods to edit current metadata on sol
oh?
you usually add it when minting
what type of metadata?
does anyone have examples on adding Metadata to NFT tokens? I know of metaplex but I'm kinda confused on how to use it...
how's everyone doing
heya
Thanks so much!
I can't get it working to add a message to a transaction (like: "hello receiver") 😦 
It should be done using the function, I guess: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/TransactionInstruction.html

If someone would be willing to share a simple javascript example, that would be really helpful. Would be willing to pay a little SOL for it
sure
can I pm you urkes?
<@!824813784006524958> done
why don't u use partialSign method on the TX?
in mainnet, me. lol
Alright who needs sol?
I'm getting error: `Error: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds`
No luck at my end
(devnet)
solfaucet is not working?
can someone please airdrop me a couple of sol also? GedyxUsUWiA3Mf78W5Xr4ChkVPj44AH4tLbBMtPhTZu6 Thanks!
this is what I'm trying to do: 

    User partial sign tx in frontend(solana/web3.js)
    Serialized tx data and pass to our backend
    Server deserialized tx and add_signer(solana-py)
    Serialized tx and send raw tx
there must be a way
no one?
Please tell me where I can find this element source. Thank you.
or is there another code for partial signatures?
the code in the backend would add the signer's public key and signature. my question is, will the signedTransaction in the above case be acceptable?
but this this is not partial is it not?
and then send the signedTransaction to the backend?
do I have to initiate const transaction = new Transaction();
const signedTransaction = await window.solana.signTransaction(transaction);
I have a question with regards to how to partial sign from the frontend (solana web3 js) and then sending the signature to the backend to process the transaction
Can someone nice airdrop me 2 sol on devnet as well. Tried for quite a while and kept failing

thank you very much, I was completely stuck on my experiments
I can be your airdrop for sometime xD
thanks!!
sent 2 sol,
I was the one that reported it one hour ago
yes since this morning
<@456226577798135808> Airdrop is not working for you too?
I am stuck without devnet sols
If you can send me even only 2 devnet sol if would be great KB57MrwvRconRf81ReZwPrzS7gcEbBxZa6iWjydREVN
It also doesn't work for me
Check this, this is also failing

perfect! This is what I was looking for. Thank yo!
Run the hello world example on solana githuv. See where they put hello world then put your own message
Hmm, can't seem to find it. Would you be able to point me into the right direction? How can I add a message (like: "hello receiver") to a transaction?
if someone can send  me devnet sol it would be cool
Same here.
Mmm Ok so it is not an issue on my side
Same here
is it a solana network issue?
solana airdrop 1 --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

Hello. I am trying to fund a devnet account to do some experiments with solana.
When I follow the instruction of the doc, I cannot airdrop 1 sol on the devnet
You can look at the Memo program and add its instruction in your transaction.
Okay, thanks. I will look into it
I think it's something like (when havin the transaction and only needing to add the message):
transaction.add( transactionInstruction )
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#add
Where the transaction instruction specifies data
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/TransactionInstruction.html
Metaplex has good code for making nfts or look at the token program example on solana github. Nft is just an image with some metadata cant imagine you need something that's not done already
im also getting this
What do you mean? I am looking for functions to use or how it works conceptually to look for it myself
Edit the metaplex code
hi i was curious if any1 could help me with solana contract
So I have transfer set up, but how can I add a message (like 'hello receiver') to a transfer?
What you mean that's now how it works that's exactly how it works if that's what you want. Why wouldn't you use a UI if it does what you need. You can make with cli  but you have no need to from what you've said
I'll DM!
Hey buddy. I am working on exactly that. And its not how things are at solana. However I am having some great help from some folks here and making some progress. Do you want to collab on this? DM?
Is everything alright with `airdrop` right now? I'm getting this:

```
$ solana airdrop 1
Requesting airdrop of 1 SOL
Error: account does not have enough SOL to perform the operation
```
yeah.... I don't want to go through a UI. 😉 

I want to do it all through programming. 

send people an nft to their wallet for them to sell on marketplaces. But maybe that's not how it's done on solana?
im asking because i want to mint a token for a project and distrubute some of them. dont want to find an issue and have to redistibute another token. if i send someone a token but they dont have any sol in thier wallet how will they pay rent? going to sleep at me
can i make changes to a token after I mint it? is there any changes i should consider making to the token program on github or just mint however many tokens i want and it should be compatible with most things?
can create an nft with it through the ui
ya. i think theres other nft exchnages wilth a bunch of stuff but this is your own site
So in this case the user mints the NFT to put it in their own market? 

is there a big market on solana? or does everyone sell off their own website?
its was pretty easy i did it today. its a full ui for minting and selling NFTs https://unbrandedfinance.github.io/metaplex#/auction/7sJzUuLNW1qzE5jxyfALsyRbpyVEJWttbTVYT6t8iJ8v
I guess I could go through that website and try to figure out a base contract from it and how they're interacting?
wow. so this is a whole nft store! Know anything simpler? 😄 

I was kind of looking to start trying to create a website with a mint button like we have on ethereum. 🙂 

Something simple, where I deploy a solana contract, and people can click a button on the website to make a mint. 

here's the website on ethereum https://koalunatics.com
probably gives some response with reason wy
400 means youre sending a bad request
Code hasn't changed, just started throwing them.
Getting 400 Bad request back on my transactions out of nowhere on the devnet, anyone else experiencing this?

Hey all! Interested in NFTs

Any good guides or sample contracts to start with on Solana?
wow going straight to the at everyone
@everyone
please help i am trying to install the solana CLI
```C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe v1.7.11``` when i run this command it says checking for updates but it never says anything past that
Is there a read-only function in Solana that is similar to solidity?
great, ty!
you can try metaplex I think. It's a full nft marketplace that has minting functionality. But better to know rust 🙂
hi, i need to know rust to create a DAPP to mint NFT? or i'll able to do that with js web3 (sorry i'm newbie as dev) thanks
Is there any way to get token transfer transaction history of specific associated account?
I am looking into building a collection of NFT on Solana so I read about how it works, but I have a question: If I use Metaplex to link metadata to my NFTs, will I be able to sell the NFT in other marketplaces once their minted? I was wondering if they all handle metadata in the same way
can anybody help me how i can store public key to state
error
Ok thank you!
it is a (PDA) program derived address. token metadata account is calculated by mint.
more about PDA https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses
{let mint = await splToken.Token.createMint(
    connection,
    fromWallet,
    fromWallet.publicKey,
    null,
    9,
    splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  )}
do I pass it as a parameter?
and where would I access tokenMetadataAccount? is there a specific function in spl?
in Solana, a NFT is just a mint but supply 1. its metadata will store in a derived address, `tokenMetadataAccount` .
more information you can take a look at https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard#token-metadata-program
<@788215642070581289> would you know how to add metadata to an NFT? createMint functions dont take any data input parameters right?
I could use `getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo` to create an account for that, right? <@!788215642070581289>
Ah, I see.
there are two different account in token program, `token account` and `mint`, in your code, you have already created a mint, the next step you will need to create a `token account` for your SOL address. and I recommend you use `associated token address`
I'm trying to draw parallels with this guide https://www.quicknode.com/guides/web3-sdks/how-to-mint-an-nft-on-solana
So I have created a `mintAccount`. Should that account be rather holding the token? And later, can I transfer this token to my SOL address?
seems you want to mint some token to your SOL address. Unfortunately a SOL address can't hold any tokens. you need to create a token account to hold token.
<@!738578847112495205> I have no idea how to do that thats why I was asking haha
Haven't done that part yet. I am planning to use Metaplex Standards in "some way" to get this done. Do you have any ideas?
<@!738578847112495205> where in this code do you load the metadata of the NFT? like img etc
Hello. I am trying to write a TS code to create a token and mint it later. However, I am facing error in the `createMintToInstruction` call. Somehow the params seems to be wrong.  My code is at https://gist.github.com/r4881t/826e1ecd83285efe7e83eecac0cfb831#gistcomment-3883358
In token swap project, https://github.com/solana-labs/oyster-swap/blob/master/src/utils/ids.tsx#L74 , where this "9qvG1zUp8xF1Bi4m6UdRNby1BAAuaDrUxSpv4CmRRMjL" come from? If I want to deploy my own token swap program, how do I get same thing and update this file?
hahaha.. yea. I know.. I just wanted to report it somewhere.
just remove the http:// at the start
http://https//www.solana.com/developers that is what is routing to

https://solana.com/news/getting-started-with-solana-development
Not sure where to put this but this URL on the website is broken:
Again the docs online show CLI usage and that seems to take in only 3 parameters none including a json file as shown on https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard
Another q: How do I attach metadata to an NFT through spl
Thank you! also it works now!! 🙂
i dont know node well enough id ask these people https://discord.gg/MfJC5gR6
The docs only show CLI functionality
it doesn't I think due to path problems on my PC but I guess my general q is do I have to clone and build the SPL in my local PC before requesting it and doing stuff? is there no way to include it as a dev dependency?
doesnt this example work? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/examples/create_mint_and_transfer_tokens.js
referring to this specifically https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/js
In the js docs they simply import it as require('@solana/spl-token') but this doesnt exist as an importable library?
Hey guys if I am trying to use the SPL's token implementation in an IDE how can I import it?
Nice
use `msg!` in the program then get and parse the program log by `getTransaction`
hey guys，i want to know how to emit events like solitidy in solana
No good integrated viewer yet, but there is work towards verified programs here https://anchor.projectserum.com/
Can we see rust program code on solana blockchain, like ethereum’s abis or contract data?
maybe you can start from https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld
are there any stats on current available capacity of archivers?
read field
parse the account
that is not how to get a balance
I ran into trouble trying to build solana binaries with Apple M1 chip so I will post what made it work for me here (and anyone can always DM me if you run into trouble):

1. Make sure you install rosetta and then install homebrew with a shell that is using rosetta: https://5balloons.info/correct-way-to-install-and-use-homebrew-on-m1-macs/
2. Make sure you also install rust/cargo/rustup inside that rosetta shell as well bc it will target x86_64 instead of aarch64
3. then install solana by following the "Build From Source" at the bottom of: https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools
- you may run into an issue with openssl, if you do, then `brew install openssl` (once again inside the rosetta shell)
<@!831450660146642974> I have to do CPI to get this balance, is there any other place(except for instruction) that I can invoke CPI?
I am new to rust so I think I need to start there hehe
Yup! Takes some digging of GitHub to find it but it’s there 🙂
Thanks!
Unfortunately do not have client side deserializing tho
They have an instruction to set metadata where you can set the URI for the NFT
Check docs.metaplex.com
Hello I am an Ethereum dev looking to jump to Solana, Ive been reading the docs but I havent seen a way to "link" metadata json files to NFTs. For example on Ethereum we have the setURI function in the ERC721 contracts where the URI points to a server that hosts the JSON metadata files, as far as I know it is way easier to create NFTs on Solana (and cheaper) but I wasnt able to understand how the metadata is added. Any info is appreciated thanks!
but if you read one balance, why are you doing that?
The trick to make a view method in a program is to use `msg!`, use simulation in the frontend to parse the created log
I want to make a feature that returns token balance in a simple program. I made an instruction that returns balance integer but failed like <@!831450660146642974> said. Then what can I do for this feature?
no
i believe rust will be just fine checking 32 bytes of the mint and discarding very quickly
Quick question: can instructions return integer or string value as a result?
don't filter, listen to all, filter in your backend
Actually this won't work, since I have more than 100Ks addresses that I need to listen to. Doing memcp won't work
using the onProgramAccountChange api, I can essentially push the filtering down to the rust client layer right?

```
Optional commitment: Commitment
Specify the commitment level account changes must reach before notification

Optional filters: GetProgramAccountsFilter[]
The program account filters to pass into the RPC method
```

So that I can avoid doing the filters in javascript
I might start with the web3.js lib first. I will use the rust client in the next version
by the way you can use rust, with the `solana-client` crate
well I am very glad that I didn't go down the "subscribe to every account route"
Ohh right. Yeah. I will put it up once I can get this to work
then NFT projects can use it
making an open source backend that show transactions of NFTs per collection
You mean building an account listener would be a cool project?
Sorry what is a cool project? We must be talking about multiple topics haha
where is the data going to surface?
this would actually be a cool project
then do
ah you do
exclude mints by adding a size filter
I will listen to both
Got it. So since, I care about both account and mint.
Mint
would it be mint layout??
if it is not account layout, what else can it be?
// TODO: do we need a better way to identify layout (maybe a enum identifing type?)
          if (info.accountInfo.data.length === AccountLayout.span) {
btw,... what is this?
computer very strong
even serialize in series i believe
yes
I can have a single listener and just drop it into a message queue immediately
Ok. So we don't need sharded processing for a while
but i believe it must be some insane thing that can handle hundred to thousand times more
need to look at the rpc node websocket lib
Oh 26 TPS looks fine. Even though, I guess we will eventually run into scalability limits as solana hopefully grows to the moon and beyond
26 TPS seems like nothing for a well written backend
yes
let's open a random block https://explorer.solana.com/block/95155979/accounts
token program is present 16 times per block => 26 TPS
Are you talking abaout this line of code? 
```
      // This can return different types of accounts: token-account, mint, multisig
      // TODO: web3.js expose ability to filter.
      // this should use only filter syntax to only get accounts that are owned by user
      const tokenSubID = connection.onProgramAccountChange(
        programIds().token,
        (info) => {
          // TODO: fix type in web3.js
          const id = (info.accountId as unknown) as string;
          // TODO: do we need a better way to identify layout (maybe a enum identifing type?)
          if (info.accountInfo.data.length === AccountLayout.span) {
            const data = deserializeAccount(info.accountInfo.data);

            if (PRECACHED_OWNERS.has(data.owner.toBase58())) {
              cache.add(id, info.accountInfo, TokenAccountParser);
              setTokenAccounts(selectUserAccounts());
            }
          }
        },
        "singleGossip"
      );

```
Got it. What is the rough QPS on token program traffic? Don't need exact number, just curious on the order of magnitude. Can a single threaded program actually handle this?

Is there a way to shard this over multiple listeners?
Thanks btw!
dapp-scaffold does that
yes, but the payload is tiny and this is the easiest solution IMHO
all token program, wouldn't that be a lot of traffic?
i guess the most ergonomic, listen to all token program token account changes, then filter out anything that isn't in the 10k mints
So I have a collection of NFTs (As an array of mint addresses). Each collection is O(10,000) NFTs (which is 10K mint address and 10K token account addresses) and I am trying to listen for if any of the NFT changed hands.
Hi, I am writing a program that requires a client account signature and my wallet's signature. For now it is a program that basically sends some money from client to my wallet and back from my wallet to the client's wallet. I had this working locally with private keys locally stored/created but not sure what would be the best way to approach this in a real scenario. It seems like the wallet provider signs the transaction for the client but not sure at which point I would add the signature for my own wallet. Ideally, I would have a backend that receives the signed transaction somehow and adds my own signature to finally send it to my program but I am not sure this is possible at all (I am guessing not)
this is quick question...
umm ok let me think about this a bit more. Thank you. I do need to use onProgramAccount. So let me see if it would be possible to just use onProgramAccountChange for everything
no, but if they are all belonging to the same program onProgramAccountChange is the best
is there some sort of onMultipleAccount change? So that I can listen to lots of accounts at once? (I do have a dedicated node)
I understand there is a large backlog however there needs to be a more efficient way to do this. This is having significant impacts on our users.
Hi everyone, I'm working with the Solana SPL Launchpad twitter.com/intersola_io and we have been waiting now 5-6 weeks to have our token added to the list. We've submitted the PR and yet this hasn't seemed to have been looked at. This is a very frustrating experience considering the absolute silence from the Solana team. Please review and approve - https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/640
If you do this, you can probably just do onProgramAccountChange, with a filter. What are you listening to?
yes, do not do that, a RPC a node has a max number of websockets
Rate limits found here https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints
Probably not advisable without your own node. You'll hit the public rpc rate limits pretty quickly
Is there scalability limits of how many accounts these can listen to?

`connection.onAccountChange`

I want to use this in a nodejs backend and potentially listen to O(10,000) accounts. Is this advisable?
ah, yep, that does the trick. thanks!
use the tokenProgramId, of the token program itself: TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA

`getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner(pubkey, { programId: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID });
    data = {
      tokens: value.map((accountInfo) => {
        const parsedInfo = accountInfo.account.data.parsed.info;
        const info = create(parsedInfo, TokenAccountInfo);
        return { info, pubkey: accountInfo.pubkey };
      })`
The current solution is quite simple:
social trust in the project => use dApp
no social trust in the project => do not dApp
to be a 100% successful scam
I am thinking we can trick it even more, when UI send post request, scammer sends tx that alter the "state" to change the behaviour
but that would take up more bytes in the tx, so may run into tx being too big to fix in the ~1232 or whatever # bytes it is
would be nice to see something like guard instructions at the beginning/end. wallets could get some idea of the action being performed, then add a balance check before and after to make sure the correct amount of funds were received
this is what i was thinking earlier too. would be trivial to code up something like:
```
if slot_num < current_slot + 2:
    transfer_full_amount()
else:
    steal_funds()
```
I guess I could try that and find out
So the alternative is knowing all the public keys of all the mints? or is the program id the SPL token program id?
I saw that, but I couldn't find a way to call it without the filter
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountsbyowner https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getTokenAccountsByOwner
<:think_thonk:848360227665739797>
I guess that doesn't quite work either -- the transaction history is only in scope for signatures made by the account's private key
Quick q: using web3.js, how do you get the list of all token balances for an account? I'm digging through the API and the only way I've found is to look up all transactions and materialize state from it? Is that right?
Thanks, will check it out
Metaplex is currently the standard https://docs.metaplex.com/
Im trying to support Solana for our upcoming generative project, but Im having a hard time finding resourced on how to develop the contract so that it is compatible with different marketplaces. Is there a standard yet for NFTs???
Hello team, who should I tag in Github to review this PR? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/19457
Ah perfect. I'll follow that design choice then
in many chains, a common practice is to load a token list and if needed cache portions or the entire thing on the client and do a lookup on the token/mint address.  then use a simple utility function, if necessary,  and transfer_checked where able. 

code like this is scattered all over the solana program library, source, and other projects if its not already in an endpoint api tool package or utility. 
`
/// Convert the UI representation of a token amount (using the decimals field defined in its mint)
/// to the raw amount
pub fn ui_amount_to_amount(ui_amount: f64) -> u64 {
    (ui_amount * 10_usize.pow(spl_token::native_mint::DECIMALS as u32) as f64) as u64
}

/// Convert a raw amount to its UI representation (using the decimals field defined in its mint)
pub fn amount_to_ui_amount(amount: u64) -> f64 {
    amount as f64 / 10_usize.pow(spl_token::native_mint::DECIMALS as u32) as f64
}
`

this is just an example. conversions and utility functions are a staple.
You may not have to do this for conversion. You probably could still have the same type sent each time, and just rely on preflight checks.
My guess is that they probably have some hardcoded program list of "trusted" open source programs, and use it to display where the transaction is going. I'd be surprised if they didn't have a bug bounty and will probably be happy for you to create and showcase any exploit
Right, so what I'm hearing is make an async call to get the number of decimals and coerce whatever float I'm trying to convert to the right uint64 based on that response, and do that every time I need to invoke a transaction. Was just curious because it would seem everyone would have to do this every time they want to create a transfer
Nobody reviewed that thing?!?
i am afraid this is a retarded feature, i'll make an exploit example and share
I would reply to Phantom on Twitter asking. They're not open source on their extension
All tokens could have different amount of decimals. It doesn't actually matter in regards to the type for sending. If you're just waiting on a return, you could use a type, but for invoking a transaction you probably want to check the decimals because you could fail a transaction with the wrong decimals.
or the slot
Hmm I see, would it then be common practice to make such an API call to fetch the number of decimal places and perform the calculation every time I need to create a transfer instruction? I guess I was wondering if there was some utility function to do it for me (e.g. it takes in a float like 25.2 and returns the proper uint64)
something as simple as using the blockhash (transfer or not) to alter the result is my first idea to cheat it
if there is any way to cheat it, rest assured scammers will be on it in 5 minutes
I am concerned about
https://twitter.com/phantom/status/1434515340730540033?s=20
Is this actually safe? Is simulation 100% realistic, with no way of cheating it?
ignoring front-running for now
There's a lot of calls that give decimals of a token. https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountbalance, https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokenaccountbalance, https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettokensupply
Any of these will work, depending on what you want.
This is usually something wrong with your transaction. Could be anything -- depending on the program you're calling
When calling `createTransferInstruction` to transfer tokens, is there some api call I can make before hand to learn the number of decimals that exist for the particular kind of token I'm trying to transfer? Not sure how else I'd sent the correct amount unless I hardcoded a mapping somewhere
not sure on a specific one, but various applications attempt to implement lottery. you could try various off chain approaches to generate and send in the random value to experiment.
During the initial minting process of NFTs, is it the convention for the creator to hold on to the metadata ownership? In other words, will the creator of the NFT always have the metadata ownership?
Anyone running into `RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x3 [5 log messages]`?
Thanks! Can I know some project? And should I call to my off chain to get random number?
i believe we are still waiting for more widely available and backed solutions for true randomness, for easy general use. it appears various projects have come up with some of their own solutions. there is no built in or recommended 'random' yet that i am aware of.
Mainly, there are a lot of external variables in an ETH contract but I see in SOL every NFT is being minted with a separate address. Is there some standard that all these projects launching have kinda like theERC721?

Hello guys, I am trying to build an NFT collection and drop in the Solana network but I am not sure where to start. I come from the ETH blockchain and it is quite different here... Is there any example projects or somewhere to start?
for simple, break is on all the networks last I checked. otherwise the solana program library has some deployed. The solana token program https://spl.solana.com/ is great to interact with and check out, with source.  beyond simple you can check github or respective sites, for your favorite solana dapps to see what is available. not much comes to mind in terms of simple deployed to mainnet. several projects use the anchor framework, like synthetify. metaplex.com is a bigger more comlex example.
hello guys! can help me: how to get random in Solana?
emphasis on 'deployed on the mainnet', i.e. live projects
Yeah for sure man
i have some free time if your still stuck and to do a discord call or something
https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/examples
Devs - any example of github repo to get started? A smaller project that is already deployed on the mainnet? Just want a good project to explore and 'tinker with'.
There is much documentation as to how to use this
Can anybody tell me if there is `approve` functionality in Solana tokens? in Solidity, we can call `IERC20(token_address).approve(account, amount)` Thanks!
there is also mintNFT in
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/js/packages/web/src/actions/nft.tsx.
but you can look at https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/js/packages/common/src/actions/metadata.ts
im looking at how metaplex are doing it
just wondering how this is done
So when creating an NFT you have to specify the Token Metadata Program which allows the metadata to be added
there is no npm package for metadata program, sorry
Using the JS Bindings
what do you mean by appended? included on the creation, added later?
Does anyone know how to mint a NFT using the Token Metadata Program which allows metadata to be appended?
This is what I am refering to https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/client/token.js
web3.js doesn't include spl programs. spl token program js bindings are in @solana/spl-token. sadly it does not have html api docs but the calls are almost identical to rust ones.
yes. for example, metaplex first creates the metadata account as mutable, then after the arweave upload does updatemetadata to update the uri. im not sure to they set ismutable to false then or after creating MasterEdition.
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/
so it is set upon minting right?
just once.
is the `ismutable` flag mutable too?
for rust , yes. https://docs.rs/spl-token/3.2.0/spl_token/instruction/index.html
if the ismutable flag is true, then yes.
the good news is that everyone wants to hire a solana dev right now so you will probably just get a job that pays twice as much in a couple months time 😛
Are NFT's metadata mutable?
Hello, 6++ years experience Senior FrontEnd Engineer (React/Node/NextJS) looking for crypto job. If interested DM for more info 🙂
Are there API docs for the js SPL Token Client?
so the complicated method is to look at ```.anchor/program-logs``` and try to step through the rust code with print methods around the thing is breaking to see where its breaking in anchor test. If the methods are working in anchor test and not in your client you are sending wrogn data in / have a bad idl
Yeah tried debugging it but hitting roadblocks only, Hopefully if I can get <@501570363566587905> but he is currently unavailable I think
Pretty sure this is a type error with rust but maybe worth pinging armani about because I never came across this error
did you try reuploading the idl
I tried deploying the contracts again but it seems it aint solving the problem man
Yeah I can seee man may you help me I will surely send something for your time man, Surely if i don't finish this tonight i may lose my job man
Ok, Let me check that out but I have 3 sol on my local wallet
Can you mint nft out of a rust contract? It seems all examples I find are out of node using endpoints
you can find the source with debugging logs but its complicated =.= and you probably will have to redeploy
Check if u have enough SOL
and hten you look down 1 and u see ConstraingtHasOne
hello, there is a link on the guide that points to here: https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/blob/master/lang/src/error.rs and then there is an = 140

im using 10 different methods that i copy and pasted a bunch of times because i was also curious lo
btw tysm
have you found it to be consistent across methods, or is it dependent on the amount of data requested per type of call?
afaik from my rough testing it looks like the limit is 340
Help me please community, <@!539801435571748868>  <@!835614995714015304> <@!528068680337326081>
This is the screenshot
(I was trying to set up candy machine using metaplex 
so by running this command
ts-node cli create_candy_machine -k ~/.config/solana/id.json -p 1
i am getting this error

```
Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x8d
```
Should I make a paper wallet first?
Why can’t I insert my public address on solana CLI?
Hello
failed when i sent 500 tho
dunno i sent like 350 or so and it worked so pretty high
Found this: `"Requests can be sent in batches by sending an array of JSON-RPC request objects as the data for a single POST."`

what is the limit to the batching?
feel free to dm me
can u send me the line where u use the createMint method?
Can someone direct me towards the best possible method for conducting an nft airdrop on solana?
That throws an exception saying `Argument of type 'Wallet | null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Signer'.`
ii gave the link to the example just so u can see tthe whole process of minting and transferring tokens. In the example - fromWallet is generated and airdropped to, but in your case you want to get the wallet from the WalletAdapter. And that is it.
Yeah that is where u should be using the wallet adapter. So the second parameter in the createMint would be the wallet which u got through the useWallet()
This example works for devnet where you can request airdrops etc. On main net, its a dapp so would want user to open their wallet and perform actions. So that's where I am kinda stuck.
This is exactly what u should be doing.
Take a look at this example, i think it can help https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/examples/create_mint_and_transfer_tokens.js
Can you mint coins out of a program ?
Maybe I need to try another approach. So instead of using createMint directly, I will try to send it as a Transaction
if i want to get 300k transactions given their signatures, is there a way to make batched requests to the rpc or do i need to do each 1 by 1?
it's the first instance of type `wallet` I saw from scanning the code base
lol. don't trust me on this: https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/blob/200929e025e0b39d6e0225a62f7ea65cc102703b/packages/phantom/src/adapter.ts#L86
Yeah, but this also returns different types.
