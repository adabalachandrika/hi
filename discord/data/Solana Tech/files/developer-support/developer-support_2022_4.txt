So I must be wrong
I think Promise<JSX.Element> is correct but TypeScript just keep complaining.
This is part function I am trying to import to App (using react): export async function GetData():Promise <JSX.Element> {
Hi all! I am new to TypeScript, does anyone know how can I fixed this error?: GetData' cannot be used as a JSX component.
  Its return type 'Promise<Element>' is not a valid JSX element.
    Type 'Promise<Element>' is missing the following properties from type 'ReactElement<any, any>': type, props, keyts(2786)
can I get current block height / slot number in smart contract rust?
aside from those, coming up with your own storage and an API that can extract the data for easy off chain use might be the way then. there are some data related platforms building, like Solana fm, but existing full featured options are probably on the light side. be interested if anyone is building or come across this otherwise.
What are the options for contract indexing that are live today? I want our smart contract to be able to emit output calculations/strings that get  stored for querying from off-chain devices. 

I've looked at transaction logs https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/issues/1613 and changing an account that can be tracked through subscribers, but none of these look clean.
a well-instrumented, adaptive, app-specific tx send algo is the way
That's a valid point. I will just check for our failed transactions and base it off that. Thanks üôÇ
well consider this, what would happen to TPS if there were fewer users for a period of time?
I guess that's why I figured when tps was low that does it for me. I guess I can just keep track of what percentage of my transactions fail and base it off that. However I still don't understand how that's any different than going off of explorers tps.
Hmm interesting.
I replaced the two `network` references in the endpoint const with my rpcURL and it worked
Lemme check sir.
What is the output of `solana program list --buffers`
yes it does. after a successful redeploy, I check the blockchain and see that same address just received the `bpf loader upgradeable` transactions
Hmm and it reuses the old address?
`anchor deploy --provider.cluster mainnet` We're using this for redeploys too.
Can you send the command you are running?
yes we're redeploying to the same program address.
On the plus side, you should be able to get all that sol back.
You can redeploy a program to the same address with solana program deploy

hey fam. we spend ~5 SOL every time we want to update our Solana program. Is this normal ? or we're completely wasting money because we don't know what the heck we're doing? Would really love the help.
Huh then you should get in touch with your RPC provider.
Yeah solana seems to be having issues at the moment.
I tried that, but then all my transactions fail still.  However, if I change it to Mainnet then it works.
distributed systems are _not_ so simple as to have such a thing. the easiest way to detect congestion is to send transactions
`const endpoint = "https://rpc";`
Can you show the subscriber code?
Where would I add my custom RPC here?
Maybe use a lesser confirmation setting like processed?
We subscribe to messages from the logsSubscribe contract for confirmed transactions.
solana-test-validator taking 10 seconds to finalize a transaction - is there anyway to speed this up???? Would like to speed up my integration tests! Thanks üòÑ
OK, but how are you scanning for transactions?
Its taking 10 seconds for a transaction to complete for me on the local cluster - is there anyway to speed this up - my integration tests are very slow
When the user calls a method on our contract, an event is emitted. We can catch it when the transaction is successful. That is, we have a transaction hash and we get all the data from it.
The problem is that our scanners miss transactions.

In a highly congested situation the best way for a transaction to go trought is to just spam it and pray, or there is a way to code a more congestion resilient one?
Hmm which event are you listening to?

Hello How can I save raw  data send in &[u8] in smart contract ??
Just off the top of my head, I assume because not all rpcs support the updated method yet.
Do you have a suggestion on what metric to use then?
Hi, can someone please help me with this error. I started messing around with the cargo.toml and even updated rustup and started getting this
Hello!
We are working on Solana integration.
Part of the functionality is related to blockchain scanning - we need to receive events that have occurred on our contracts.
Connection to RPC nodes occurs via web sockets.
Several scanners are used, working in parallel and independently of each other - on public and several paid RPC nodes.
The problem is that regardless of the RPC nodes, some transactions are skipped.
Skipped by all scanners at once.
And if the event is caught, then it is caught by all scanners at once.
How can this problem be solved and what might cause it?

how to connect dapp with solflare or phantom wallet on mobile
Put it where it is convenient to you. Don't worry about what `cargo build-bpf` generates, you won't be using it so you can safely ignore.
ok so this, but no PDA, and I can `--outfile` the keygen... where am I supposed to put it so bpf doesn't regenerate?
It does for an initial deploy, yes. What your idea around PDA is wrong, yes.
hmm I didn't find how to "name" a key, but on deploy I saw that `--program-id` must be passed a keypair, so what I said earlier about creating keypair akin to PDA is not true? so the program account has a valid private key associated with it??
You have some reading to do:
`solana-keygen --help`
`solana program deploy --help`
sorry I'm really a newbie and I don't have strong familiarity with the solana cli
So, what I do is generate a key before I start building a program. I call this key 'program' so it is static.
Otherwise, when you do a `cargo build-bpf` the last message of the build points you to where you compiled program is as well as it's program key. However note: That key will be regenerated each time you do a build
so the process would be -> create_keypair (if possible with no valid private key, akin to PDA) -> use publickey as id -> CreateAccount for that key -> deploy to that key?
? what do you mean program_key.json?

thanks
kk
so you could re-check after 120s timeout
I think they say after 2 mins it is safe to assume that the tx either confirmed or failed
right
when can i know for sure.
which im doing
but even that recheck
well yeah but transaction can still be ingested despite timeout on client.
on timeout, I suppose you could re-check using the signature to see whether or not the tx was actually confirmed
I get an error message on the timeout - using sendAndConfirmTransaction
recommended to extend to 120sec in connectionconfig if you haven't done so already
I mean after a few minutes it becomes apparent but I mean theoretically when can I assume for certain a transaction has failed despite being given a signature.
do you have the signature?
During all this lag, transactions were taking like 60 seconds to appear for me it and if fucked up some transfers.
Is there really any way to know if a transaction has really failed?
what do you want to accomplish?
thanks

you mean historical data, previous slot numbers? I don't think so
is there any function to get blockhash by slot number/block number in solana rust smart contract?
TPS is a garbage metric. too many influences
I might try that, thanks.
There is also https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransactioncount
another related quesion: program can find pda pubkey through pda seed, but cannot get account info onchain through pda pubkey, it must get it through client pass it . that sounds like a little strange, do i understand correctly?
Hmm, thanks. Not ideal. I was hoping for perhaps a cleaner way. Not sure my RPC even supports it. Will be easier to just use explorers api to get transaction count
I know this method, but think that it is a little tedious way.  is there any method on chain program to know who is its authority
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#blocksubscribe---unstable-disabled-by-default
Maybe subscribe to blocks and count tx yourself.
Anyone know of a reliable way to determine the network status of Solana? For example if tps is below 1,500. Without having to scrape explorer, what's a good way to tell?
you can pass these two accounts into your program
and decode them to verify and get what you need
thanks~. but this is in sdk, if i used it in  program on chain, its also ok?
How can I view chain code for a given program? Anyone know an explorer that can do that?

super annoying cus projects store metadata off chain on an endpoint so it takes a while to get metadata for all NFT's if the user has a lot of nft's
getting the metadata is another step
A speedy way to do this is to use getParsedProgramAccounts to get the token accounts for a given public key, then search through those for held NFTs (decimals=1, token amount in account =1), would look something like this:

grab token accounts:
```
const token_accounts = await connection.getParsedProgramAccounts(
      splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, // new PublicKey("TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA")
        {
          filters: [
            {
              dataSize: 165, // number of bytes
            },
            {
              memcmp: {
                offset: 32, // number of bytes
                bytes: publicKey, // base58 encoded string, the public key you want token accounts from.
              },
            },
          ],
        }
      );

```

loop through the accounts to identify NFTs.
```
      let tokenInfo=token_accounts.map(x=>x.account.data.parsed.info)
 
      let nfts=[];
      for (let info of tokenInfo){
        if(info.tokenAmount.amount=="1"){
          nfts.push(info.mint)
        }
      }

  console.log(nfts) // prints mint addresses for each NFT user currently 
holds
      
```

Hey guys, How can I get all NFTs present in account using accounts publicKey ?
thanks <@!958023453905133619> . Found a workaround. See my message above.
Ok, figured it out. I should skip signature verification.    

const serializedTransaction = transaction
      .serialize({ verifySignatures: false, requireAllSignatures: false })
      .toString('base64');
Try encoding transfers in a separate way and sending that encoded part to the client, you could use something like a JSON array maybe?
Hey. Im trying to generate transaction on the server, serialize it and send it back to mobile device to sign. 

When I call serilize method I'm getting "Signature verification failed" error.

How could I workaround this?

I updated the solana cli to the latest version 1.8.16 - I'm on a windows machine running wsl but have had no problems before today. Any ideas?
hmmm that's a good question. So initially I ran into this because I was doing a `getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount` and then immediately after awaiting, I would make the token transfer. I got a lot of `TokenAccountNotFoundError` in that case, and I was kinda assuming there was some sort of race condition going on (so I upped the commitment level to 'finalized' but that didn't have the effect i was hoping for). I would say this would happen about ... 1 out of 7 attempts. So I refactored the code to do the `getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount` at the very start of the whole experience, so probably about a minute before a user would get a token transfer and this _seems_ to have solved the issue, _but_ i've had one instance of `TokenAccountNotFoundError` when trying to make the initial account. Hard to say how much this is happening as now most the people who were going to create an account (to get a token transfer) most likely _have_ already done it. So not sure if my refactor helped, or if people just have accounts at this point
Although if you are trying to calculate it because you don't want to interact with a server, then you might also hard code in some known block times so that you can interpolate between them
in the blockTime field
Yeah looking at the API, <https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getblock> has it
I haven't, but I assumed there is an RPC call that does it ..
Did you look at the implementation of `solana block-time`?
is there a good way to calculate an approximate timestamp for a past slot? the only way i can think of is liek `(current_slot - past_slot) * default_ms_per_slot` and then subtract that from a timestamp, but i assume error grows without bound the further back you go? there isnt anything to use as a milestone is there
anyone else transactions keep timing out

I did a solana balance and I also grabbed more from the faucet
Hi! Someone already have this error ?
We use this on a collection of 4000+ and don't have any issues.
That is MEs escrow wallet. So you can tell if an NFT is going in or coming out.
Then of course in here you can do your magic eden checks.
yeah makes sense. thanks a lot!

It's not always a transaction of moving an NFT which gets fired. So we check our database and compare it with the address of the NFT. If it was just a rent check our something we ignore it, only care if the owner is different.
Ah ok thank you... I feared something like this would be the solution üòõ

Then we compare that to our collection hashlist
So inside we decode the account data, and extract the mint.
Be prepared to be disappointed. 
Method we found to work well.
Subscribe to the token program. A LOT of data just got subscribed too.
We add a filter on the subscription because we only care about single amount movements.
Or if there is an alternative method I'm supposed to use for this
I'm trying to subscribe to particular transactions - I have a hashlist for a collection and I want to execute an action when it is included in a transaction (i.e. ME listing/delisting)

If I use the python library's `logs_subscribe()` method, I can filter by a single hash, or I can use `program_subscribe()` and pass the Token Program pubkey, then manually filter all results for only those containing NFTs from my hash list... which seems quite cumbersome.

I'm wondering if there is a way I can use the filter to only retrieve logs for all of the NFTs in my hashlist, without subscribing to each NFT's logs individually.
How are you verifying that?
but i have a balance
getting Error: Sender has insufficient funds, current balance is 0
anybody else having issues with spl-token transfer in devnet?
there should be an example in the solana labs program library github farm folder.
I'm sure a simple question. Can I disable minting on an NFT I create so it can only be the only one minted, however can I leave the the ability to update metadata? If so, how can I check an NFT on change if it has minting disabled or not.
ah ok great, thanks
AToken is purely a lil helper program, which lets you create nice addresses to store tokens at: person P's token account for tokens of mint M can live at a PDA address derived from the seeds [P, M] (conceptually)
Token is the actual token program‚Äîall token logic goes in there, transfers, mints, etc.
can someone explain the conceptual difference between the `ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL` and `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` programs?

Anyone have an example of raydium cpi ?
do you have anything reproducable where if run 'x' times there is any expected failure? Or just something you occasionally noticed but have not yet linked?   I personally have not seen this.
Same error with solana-cli 1.10.5. Honestly I am really lost here
Yeah, not sure, I'm on a v fresh local solana, so I guess you could try installing a different solana version, just as a check?
I'm using solana-cli 1.9.5 and "@solana/web3.js": "^1.37.0"
Ok, well, tried that too and it seemed to work fine on my machine. Are you on a super old solana or something?
https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1
with the JS SDK, occasionally i get the a `TokenAccountNotFoundError` error from the `getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount` method. It is inconsistent (works most the time) so I don't think i'm doing anything wrong on my end. Seems like it should create the token account if not found, as per the method name, so how could it not find one? 

Anything I should consider about this?
What is that `secp` library? I don't seem to have `getPublicKey` in secp256k1.js
As you can see that's the same test, and the Secp256k1 part is all good (the `secp.verify` passes with no problems at all).
Here's the code of the test I'm running:

```typescript
    // Solana User
    let user: web3.Keypair = web3.Keypair.generate();
    await conn.confirmTransaction(
        await conn.requestAirdrop(user.publicKey, 5 * web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL),
        "confirmed"
    );

    const privateKey = secp.utils.randomPrivateKey();
    const publicKey = secp.getPublicKey(privateKey);
    const ethAddress = web3.Secp256k1Program.publicKeyToEthAddress(publicKey.slice(1));

    await conn.confirmTransaction(
        await conn.requestAirdrop(user.publicKey, 10 * web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL),
    );

    const message = Buffer.from('string address');
    const messageHash = ethers.utils.arrayify(
        ethers.utils.keccak256(
            Buffer.from("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n" + message.length + message)
        )
    );
    const [signature, recoveryId] = await secp.sign(messageHash, privateKey, {der: false, recovered: true});

    // The signing process is fine
    assert.ok(secp.verify(
        signature,
        messageHash,
        publicKey
    ));

    // But this??
    const transaction = new web3.Transaction().add(
        web3.Secp256k1Program.createInstructionWithEthAddress({
            ethAddress: ethAddress.toString('hex'),
            message,
            signature,
            recoveryId,
        })
    );

    await web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction(conn, transaction, [user]);
```
The only thing I'm changing is the dependency to find Secp256k1 keys and signatures. But I still have no clue on why I get a precompile error
`Error: 410 Gone:  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code": 410, "message":"The RPC call or parameters have been disabled."}}`

https://twitter.com/GenesysGo/status/1508295993581871104

based on Genesys Go's thread, is there a workaround to use `getProgramAccounts` ?
Oh, derp, the [from] in the example is the tx fee payer, got it
What happens if you get rid of the `[from]` part? I realized I hadn't included that, but I get an unknown signer issue if I include it (invoking with some anchor stuff, so not quite the same invocation as that sendAndConfirmTransaction thing)
Interesting, I just ran that locally and it seemed to work fine
I copied "create secp256k1 instruction with string address" from L37
Which `it` fails?
Hello. I copied a test from `solana-web3.js/test/secp256k1-program.test.ts`. **It is literally not working, as is**.

Same error I was getting when trying to build my own tests, `SendTransactionError: failed to send transaction: Transaction precompile verification failure InvalidAccountIndex`.

I created a new walllet and a new token now I try to send my token to a phantom wallet but it gives me an error
Error: The recipient address is not funded. Add --allow-unfunded-recipient to complete the transfer??
does the total used amount of compute units determine anything in a transaction? for example, if a transaction uses less compute units will it be processed faster?
If I use this, then I get lots of messages:
```go
sub, err := client.LogsSubscribeMentions(
        program,
        rpc.CommitmentRecent,
    )
```
I am trying to use the websocket API to listen for all transfers by doing the following (in Go)... weird part is I am not getting any events for the account of the system program, which I feel like I should be getting lots
```go
program := solana.MustPublicKeyFromBase58("11111111111111111111111111111111") // nft candy v2

    sub, err := client.AccountSubscribe(
        program,
        "",
    )
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer sub.Unsubscribe()

    log.Println("Waiting on program events...")
    for {
        got, err := sub.Recv()
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }
        spew.Dump(got)
    }
```

Maybe I'm missing a dependency? I can build https://github.com/ckamm/solana-accountsdb-connector just fine which uses solana-rpc. I tried a few different rust versions, but it didn't help
Btw in the last spl-token library, there are described `import splToken from "@solana/spl-token";`
But the new version, can't read 
How can I fix the issue
Does someone know about this?
Could you please tell me more detail?
Hi, i hope you can help me.
I get an dns error (11001) if i want to create a new token on the devNet "spl-token create-token".
is it a good practice to approve a token delegate of amount 1 and after processing transaction **revoke the token delegate**?
if you want to increase the supply, you use mint to is a correct way.
You can't just increase the supply and don't issue any real tokens.
you need a token account to store these tokens.
Thanks for your offer
What I mean, I just want to increase the supply
Hey to all! Hope you can help me.
Im searching info about spl token as nft.
So i need to create spl token with metadata (uri/img/info) that will shows on Collectible tab on wallet, i need it like mint pass (Phantom will show it like nft but it will be spl token). I tried to create spl-token with metaplex upload (config file/0.png/0.json) but no working. Token exist but not showing on collectible tab. I know that it is possible but there is no info....
Btw, how does solscan get live transactions data though? üßê
Hm. Thanks for all the help!
but yeah.. its kinda the opposite way
you can get all related accounts via the getTransaction - posting the signature you get from onLogs
Oh. I needed a way to get transaction live data of several wallets. I think that‚Äôs not possible yet!
onProgramAccountChange:  {
  accountId: PublicKey {
    _bn: <BN: 3da33af37113d077d9af8db1215e964a87f6ee8a09256b9de526057f2321ef55>
  },
  accountInfo: {
    lamports: 1677360,
    data: <Buffer 01 ab 20 cb 1d ba 0d 37 85 57 a5 7c 46 05 ff 7b e1 43 74 81 99 0d 02 43 fd e6 f9 df 93 44 60 e3 7e db 62 b6 c8 05 b0 88 69 ef bc d2 49 3b 01 13 29 e2 ... 63 more bytes>,
    owner: PublicKey {

    },
    executable: false,
    rentEpoch: 294
  }
}
yeah... sounds about right.. you can use onProgramAccountChange for that case of catching the transaction
Okay. accountSubscribe doesn‚Äôt return any result in regards of the transaction according to the example result I saw.
To resume a deploy, pass the recovered keypair as the
[BUFFER_SIGNER] to `solana program deploy` or `solana write-buffer'.
Or to recover the account's lamports, pass it as the
[BUFFER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS] argument to `solana program close`.
========================================================================
Error: Custom: Invalid blockhash
but im not sure about that.. try and update üôÇ
im not sure normal user wallets have any logs related
Thanks. Does onLogs only trigger for programs or also for normal user wallets?
i think its pretty straight forward
I checked but couldn‚Äôt find anything useful. Maybe I missed something.
not sure.. maybe you should ask the devs here.. 

or you can read and see responses here:
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#accountsubscribe
here a snippet for you:

connection.onLogs(escrowProgramId, async (logs, context) => {
    console.log("Updated program logs   : ", logs, new Date().getTime()),
      console.log("Updated program context: ", context, new Date().getTime());
    const signatureStatus = await connection.getSignatureStatus(logs.signature);
    console.log("Updated program sig: ", signatureStatus);

    const transaction = await connection.getTransaction(logs.signature);
    console.log("Updated program transaction: ", transaction);

    // console.log(
    //   "Updated program info accountId: ",
    //   updatedAccountInfo.accountId.toBase58()
    // ),
    // console.log(
    //   "Updated program info owner: ",
    //   updatedAccountInfo.accountInfo.owner.toBase58()
    // ),
    // console.log(
    //   "Updated program info data: ",
    //   Buffer.from(updatedAccountInfo.accountInfo.data)
    // ),
    ("confirmed");
  });
Okay. Is there any other simple method do directly listen to a wallets transactions and get the data from there?
yep... sounds good
If not then I think I will have to listen to onLogs, get the signature and call getTransaction upon it.
i dont think so...
I don‚Äôt see onAccountChange returning the tx signature. Does it return any?
ex. - 
Updated program logs   :  {
  signature: '3Tvi58X6oSoC2LhggFRaeGQuEM3Y1tuaWeyuaxNPSxDYcAbAmWwmKnNZFx4dEDozrKcmSEZMcqpKotpveTspN2Bf',

}
onLogs prints only the logs found on your program.... with the signature of the tx
On which should I listen to get the transaction data?
yes
Both?
yes
i tried it.. but it just prints all the logs... to use it i have to match the result which is a string.. i don't like that approach.. i would like to subscribe to a specific event.. like on Ethereum.. but i guess its not possible..
I wanted to ask, does `.onLogs` or `.onAccountChange` trigger upon making a transaction?

it worked thank you <@134416332509675520>
Just try again I guess ü§û
now what?
its installed
But anchor here is just calling out to your existing solana build process, it's not doing anything special on its own
I would maybe just try reinstalling, not sure why it wouldn't be there
At least for me I really do have that directory you're missing, and I believe the solana installation process should have given you one too
it would appear that i have
```kaleb-mbair:tic-tac-toe kalebamarante$ solana --version
solana-cli 1.9.1 (src:b66e2ae3; feat:4100269022)```
Are you sure you've installed solana itself correctly?
That actually sounds like a solana error, not an anchor error
Same here, really need somewhere to start from
why do i keep getting this directory related errors with anchor?
```BPF SDK: /Users/kalebamarante/.local/share/solana/install/releases/1.9.1/solana-release/bin/sdk/bpf

Silly question, but how long does it take before the Token List data updates and reflects with Solana supported wallets? eg. the logo, and ticker
rustc 1.6 and solana 1.10.7 are working with https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld#quick-start

woohoo!
frank, maybe you have an idea about that
hey guys, has anyone tested computation limits on Solana? Would it be possible to run machine learning computations on Solana at a comparable cost to running them on AWS?
Thanks so needs multiple transactions right? No way to do it atomically. (I‚Äôm doing research how different blockchains handle this, forgive my ignorance)
famous fox fed has a tool, but maybe it's for nft's only
Sure, get all token accounts, send them. Then send all sol last
Hello I‚Äôm wondering if there is an easy way to transfer all data (eg not just sol but all spl tokens) from a user‚Äôs address to a new address?
Let me try. Thanks!

encase any future developers need to find a block at a specific blocktime, here is a solution here that uses binary search and the web 3 sdk to find one:

You'd need to either change whatever is causing that or just do `new Pubkey(thatBase58String)` etc.
Seems like that value there isn't a Pubkey, it's just an object with that base58 string in it
useWallet will give you the WalletContextState, and then you are returning the publicKey from that?
strange... maybe i will delete the solana-install-tmp and i try from again
From front I send the publickey from useWallet() hook

i've used only the command that i found in the https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools#download-prebuilt-binaries
and after several insuccess i've tried other way of installation for windows like prebuilt binaries and source
curl https://release.solana.com/v1.10.7/solana-install-init-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe --output C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe --create-dirs                   C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe v1.10.7
sure
<@722072331702239282> Hi guys, I am on the same team as <@963101043124764712>. We have been working on this for months. We would greatly appreciate if anyone can help.
What command are you then running?
Did you open command prompt as Admin?

Hi guys, i have a problem while installing solana cli, i can run the command in the prompt for downloading the last Version of solana cli (v.1.10.7) but when i try to install says: it's impossible to execute this program, i've tried several times in the system32 and also in a folder in My desktop but i get every time the same error
I've also tried to do it with prebuilt binaries and build from source, with no success
Can anyone help me? I've already installed the solana cli on My desktop computer, but here on My laptop i fail every time i try

(i am following the documentation in the official docs of solana)
'@nfteyez/sol-rayz';
that looks fun where can I find this function?

Did you look at what I sent?

new collections will have a collectionId set
edit: but the tech is so new you'd have to code the function yourself which is tricky
from what I understand, the collectionId will be held somewhere in the token metadata
https://intercom.help/magiceden/en/articles/6098746-what-is-metaplex-certified-collection-standard
we do have the new metaplex collection standard
sites like https://howrare.is/api collect such data
you'd need a hash list for each nft collection
bump on this if anyone is familiar
-
does anybody know anyways we can find blocks around a specific time?

let's say I want to find the first block for today 11th April 2022 00:00 UTC, what route would you take to find this?
this might be helpful https://solanacookbook.com/references/token.html#how-to-get-all-token-accounts-by-owner
See message above.
Look into NFTEyez. If you dont want to use the whole Lib just look at how they do it
Or what should I Google
If it's not too lengthy could you tell me how I can import this into my file?
You want to get all the NFTs for a wallet address?
Trying to do the same thing here, if you find something please let me know as well

Where'd you get this?

It's not static so you can't reference it like that. Also it doesn't take those arguments.
I saw that in spl-token library under the class Token
I mean getMintInfo specifically.
https://solanacookbook.com/references/token.html#how-to-get-a-token-mint
Whos code are you referencing for this?
How am I supposed to write this command?
Hi, I am trying to get minim balance for rent for already existing account.

Here we have 2 types of accounts: account and token account.

I plan to get "min balance for rent" by using account's current allocated space and I can get space from this field: result->value->data->space

getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(account.getValue().getData().getSpace())

This field exists only in token accounts not in accounts.

Questions:

1. is there any other way to get "minimum balance for rent" for already existing account.
2. if my way mentioned above is the only possible way, is it possible to put this field in account response as well (result->value->data->space)

Thanks!

account response with space:
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"context":{"slot":126657537},"value":{"data":{"parsed":{"info":{"isNative":false,"mint":"4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU","owner":"9Vxg4yDsdCrK9GPCYSdY9ehBBUcTdkjJPnrsUFuiECtb","state":"initialized","tokenAmount":{"amount":"6000","decimals":6,"uiAmount":0.006,"uiAmountString":"0.006"}},"type":"account"},"program":"spl-token","space":165},"executable":false,"lamports":2039280,"owner":"TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA","rentEpoch":292}},"id":"dddd8395-9b2b-4f14-80a4-a7910e3a5c76"}


account response without space:
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"context":{"slot":126638775},"value":{"data":["","base64"],"executable":false,"lamports":200000000,"owner":"11111111111111111111111111111111","rentEpoch":293}},"id":"cfc22c01-6034-4645-b7a2-9724315beb69"}
Yes, you can use it to verify‚ÄîI linked above the function you'd use (I think)
ah ok ok thanks!
This is pseudocode so I can't really say lol
shouldn't that be easier to do as 
``let instruction = token_instruction::pay(accounts);``
Mmh but I can use nacl for verify ? Because I tried signMessage from useWallet() hook and I always have ¬´¬†undefined reading ¬´¬†data¬†¬ª¬†¬ª
Because the other program cares about having access to all of those other accounts
wait but why do we define only one pubkey in instruction, if we want to pass all accounts into the program
By double checking you're passing the correct bumps üòõ
gotcha how to solve this one.
and if the fee is constant i know the number of sinagtures
üò¶ i follow interface that need to implement fees without passing any message üò¶
But that's deprecated in favor of the one that takes a specific message
E.g. https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getfees would tell you the per-signature cost
not familiar with the new API at all sorry
Actually not sure, it used to be but maybe this is changing, hence the new API?
Is it constant fee that is multiplied by the number of signatures?
thanks
and therefore when the invoke() is called it's just the same as 
``pay(accounts)?;``
ah alright i think i get it, my mistake was that i though &alice_pubkey in instuction is a program_id, while it is just an account key
Half of all bumps are 255, so it's easy to have things kinda still work even if you accidentally pass the wrong bump variable someplace (two separate bumps have a good chance of being the same number)
You could possibly run into that non-determinism (well, sort of) if you're not passing in some bumps correctly when you do an `invoke_signed`
What if i know the number of signatures? Everytime will be 1. Is it fixed value that is multiplied by the number of signatures? üòÑ
The fee depends on the number of signatures in the message, so no, you need the message in order to determine the fee
Not sure what you mean by replace &alice_pubkey‚Äîit just transfers control to whatever program is specified by that instruction, passing along those accounts + whatever data is specified in the instruction itself
so invoke() will transfer control and replace &alice_pubkey with the &[AccountInfo] slice to perform the instruction?
You'll have to ask the wallet to sign for you (since, yeah, you don't have access to the private key), e.g. https://docs.phantom.app/integrating/extension-and-mobile-browser/signing-a-message
Is there a way to  get the current gasFee without passing msg?

Something like this https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getfeeformessage but without passing message, before it was possible with: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getrecentblockhash
But in solana cook I found nacl, and he create a keypair and sign with the private key. But I want the user sign it. And I don't have his secretKey ü§î
The API for doing cross-program invocations is definitely a bit odd, but I think it will be easier to understand if you just go look at some non-pseudo-code
Think it would be good to just jump to source on the instruction builder code, so you can see what it's doing under the hood
Calling `invoke` transfers control to a different program, passing along those accounts
ig my question is really why create a new instruction for one address, when it needs to be passed on the whole array?
Yes ok I got it !
I think you would need to pass the pubkey to the backend, don't think you can extract it from the message itself
Why iterate?
Yes I tried but I don't know how to get publicKey from the message after sign
yeah it is pseudocode, so when i call invoke() it will iterate the accounts in &instruction?
So you're generating an instruction there (which only requires a pubkey), but to actually mutate that account you need to pass it in (so that it shows up in the &[AccountInfo] slice)
Is this pseudocode? At any rate, no, here alice_pubkey isn't an executable, it's meant to just be the address of a token account (I guess, this looks like pseudocode). In solana anytime you want to interact with some account (here, so you can change its token balance or whatever), you have to pass that account in from the client
hi im very new to solana dev, i have a question regarding the core concepts of the development. 
``mod acme {
    use token_instruction;
    fn launch_missiles(accounts: &[AccountInfo]) -> Result<()> {
        ...
    }
    fn pay_and_launch_missiles(accounts: &[AccountInfo]) -> Result<()> {
        let alice_pubkey = accounts[1].key;
        let instruction = token_instruction::pay(&alice_pubkey);
        invoke(&instruction, accounts)?;
        launch_missiles(accounts)?;
    } 
`` 
&alice_pubkey is considered a program_id for the pay instruction (therefore an executable account). My question is why do we pass it to the invoke function in accounts field then?
Ty
Hey all. I've been working on decompressing solana data from Bigtable using this as a reference.

https://docs.rs/solana-storage-bigtable/latest/src/solana_storage_bigtable/lib.rs.html)

So I'm able to deserialize blocks and transactions just fine using the following:
```
pub(crate) fn deserialize_bincode_cell_data<T>(raw_data: &Vec<u8>) -> std::result::Result<T, Error>
where
    T: serde::de::DeserializeOwned,
    T: std::fmt::Debug,
{
    let data = compression::decompress(&raw_data)?;
    bincode::deserialize(&data).map_err(|err| {
        warn!("Failed to deserialize err:{}", err);
        Error::ObjectCorrupt(format!("{}", err))
    })
}

let scb = deserialize_bincode_cell_data::<StoredConfirmedBlock>(data)
let transaction = deserialize_bincode_cell_data::<TransactionInfo>(data)
```
However, I also want to get the transaction by address data (in the bigtable 'tx-by-addr'). I thought I could use the same approach as above with the bytes, but that seems not to work at all. I typically get an exception in the form:
```ObjectCorrupt("tag for enum is not valid, found 8")```
I looked at the data returned when I directly queried and saw that the columns for blocks and transactions were "bin", while the key for transactionsByAddress is "proto". So I then tried to read the bytes into a protobuf object, which did not work either. I also tried to deserialize the bytes into the proto `TransactionByAddrInfo` object instead of the rust `LegacyTransactionByAddrInfo` object.

Any idea what I'm doing wrong here? I've tried many different approaches as detailed above - I don't understand why transactions by address would be stored in a completely different way than the rest of the blocks or transactions (especially since it only contains one extra column than transactions).

Hey guys! I am working on a Solana wallet. I want to get it security tested/audited. Is there any service or company which does that? There is no rust program code involved and I am only using web3.js for the functionality.
Probably one of these https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/blob/master/README.md#naclsignopensignedmessage-publickey
Exactly! And I wanted to know if there is an off-chain way to do this verification
Ah, ok, so we're not talking about doing this on-chain, just in your backend
I have been given the exercise of sending to one of my backend routes, the pubkey as well as the signature, and verify that the wallet of the signature is the wallet that calls my route. I'm not saying that this is the best way, but this is how I was asked to do it
How can I find the supply of a token using its mint address? Using the solana api
How are you sending the pubkey? Usually you would specify it as an account and just check that that account signed
???
So you'd need to devise some additional scheme if you wanted privacy over what the chain provides
right that's basic
All transactions and account data is public
ok let me rephrase that: is it safe for a solana program to process sensitive data? in the case of a memory dump on a node. if you have a solana program where you're sending private keys to an on-chain trading bot for instance, they have to be stored in memory, right?
No, because you keep your private key private.
question: how is decrypted memory stored and transferred?  Could a node validator do a memory dump on their machine to gain access to your private keys.
Anyone has Magic Eden API key?
Hello
Anchor handles it implicitly by writing 0xFFFFFF into first 8 bytes of an account, so this is the best solution for you so far
Alright thanks!!
But you should also make sure that the account is actually closed, because it is zeroed out only after a transaction is run, and it can be recovered by anyone by passing more SOL's into an account after your instruction is done
"Closing" on Solana actually means reducing account's SOL balance to zero
An account only needs to be mutable, if I recall correctly, to close it
Yep
Hi guys! Is it possible to close an account, and refund the rent back to a SystemProgram account/wallet which is not a signer of the transaction?
when this error shows up:

To resume a deploy, pass the recovered keypair as the
[BUFFER_SIGNER] to `solana program deploy` or `solana write-buffer'.

what is the BUFFER_SIGNER ??
I tried to deploy my program but i get :

Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 0: account data too small for instruction

what might cause this ???
Good day! What is the current throughput in terms of blocks per second on Solana? I have a contract with a fairly involved logic which needs to do quite a lot of stuff in multiple transactions (as it doesn't fit in one), and I want to set a-good-enough-limit between two transaction calls so that state inside program its state is still not stale and that I can assume a user to be able to handle the difference between calling two transactions even on the fairly average internet connection
Hi! Is there a simple way to verify a signature? Compare that the pubKey sent is the one that signed
I am running into a Cannot assign to read only property '_signatureSubscriptionCounter' of object '#<Connection>' when sending transaction from the client. This is the internal implementation in solana-web3 that is causing the error: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/541fa178806bdff83204d8d90ac222936e102f65/src/connection.ts#L4633 is there any workaround for this?
ok
So, you understand that account data is a byte array of size = whatever was requested when the account was created. Programs read/write to this byte array using some form (homegrown, borsh, serde, etc.) of deserialization/serialization. In order to make sense of the byte array you retrieved you have to deserializing it using the inverse to however the program serialized it.
Hello guys üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Someone familiar with the cli in combination with ledger?
I see, thanks for explaining it to me !!!
No, not memory‚Äîit's related to how much computational "work" your program is doing
Does it related with memory (rent and space) ? Sorry I am really new.
That's showing you how many "compute units" that part of the code used, out of the total remaining budget (in this case 1400000)
I am wondering anyone knows what does 24284 / 140000 means?

Hey guys, how could I get the first creator from a candy machine id?
Can i sign transactions with blockheight 'x', then store it and send it later just by modifying  it to an up to date blockheight (without signing it again)?
how can I address this issue:
`code: 102,`
`msg: 'The program could not deserialize the given instruction'`
How many decimals in Solana native asset guys
well, the thing is, that program subscribe is you subscribing to a websocket, and listening to all the new events. Therefore you can't really get any history data. Because if that's what you were trying to do, you need to use something like getsignaturesforaddress
It has a limit of 1000 transactions, but you can go even further if you set the options.until to the last transaction that you got from the previous call
just use something like getSignaturesForAddress
Hey guys, when using the getAccountInfo method, it returns a base64 encoded string. When I decode it, it gives a really long byte string, which has some of the info about the account in it, but how can I get the exact info and how can I parse it all to not look like this:
use v.1.9.7 instead of the actual one
Who can I talk to about solana-zk-token-sdk?
Yep, Jarry's course is very good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0uhZEfVPt8&list=PLilwLeBwGuK7Z2dXft_pmLZ675fuPgkA0
const connection = new web3.Connection(
        web3.clusterApiUrl(this.networkService.getSolanaNetwork()),
        'confirmed'
      );

This results in [Error: not implemented] in react native.

Any solution?
Hi, is there any channel for documentation? I wanted to understand what this arrays are. I know this is balances - but balances of what - I guess it's match the order of `transaction.message.account_keys` 
```
preBalances: <array> - array of u64 account balances from before the transaction was processed
postBalances: <array> - array of u64 account balances after the transaction was processed
```

I took it from here: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
The rust documentation has even less documentation: https://docs.rs/solana-transaction-status/1.10.7/solana_transaction_status/struct.UiTransactionStatusMeta.html

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
    - add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "stream": require.resolve("stream-browserify") }'
    - install 'stream-browserify'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
    resolve.fallback: { "stream": false }

when following tutorials i can't quite understand how to make a solana .rs program with anchor sending sol tokens to the treasury, could someone explain this with a peace of code plz? 

If i want to do a coin flip game, from frontend i just send the money, 
   rpc.send for example
the smart contract decides whether it is heads/tails and then based on that i make/don't make a transaction to his address. Could you please show me how would it look like in code format?

Another question is like, could that smart contract have the "treasury account" or is it better to have a separate wallet for that but how will i give control? I tried googling it but it still did not make much sense so if you could briefly explain the way you understood it i would greatly appreciate

const txs = await Promise.all(blockTransactions);
```
Can anyone suggest some courses / tutorials to learn writing programs for solana in Rust?
no worries, at a glance I can tell that's not a token transfer instruction because the data is far too big. The parsed transaction API only parses a few types of instructions (stake, vote, spl-token, etc). It doesn't support parsing instructions for other programs yet. Though we could add support for anchor programs in the future
I think it was partially decoded instruction but what‚Äôs the reason?
I don‚Äôt see the `parsed` field as stated in the docs.
Like this ```json
"instructions": [
          {
            "accounts": [1, 2, 3, 0],
            "data": "37u9WtQpcm6ULa3WRQHmj49EPs4if7o9f1jSRVZpm2dvihR9C8jY4NqEwXUbLwx15HBSNcP1",

          }
        ]```

Hi, is it possible to get all nft collection mint addresses with solana.py?

Thank you <@585868308419444749> I get it, thanks for your help!

cant deploy my program on mainnet, Custom: Invalid blockhash Anyone can help?
you're looking at the wrong thing, like i already said
that's my transaction

how do I convert that to base58 addresses?
In this case it's supposed to be like that since it's a spl token transfer, so based on this https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/transactions#instruction-format it's supposed to be like that right?
that's only the data field.  it's totally defined by the program
for example, the first index is the program id, right?
So you need both the message and the compiled instruction to resolve the input accounts for every instruction
each space is representing something right?
that's what I have right now

it's an array of indexes into the account_keys array from the `Message`
any clue would be really helpful
To be honest I don't understand well how to decode it
and the compact array has another definition
Does anybody knows how to do this? I see the docs and says this "An instruction contains a program id index, followed by a compact-array of account address indexes, followed by a compact-array of opaque 8-bit data"
I have a question related to my serialized tx. I already have the transaction broadcast working but I would like to validate that instruction is for a specific token so I have to read the data buffer from the transaction instruction
I have a question, is it possible to freeze/ lock the token by the token owner (not the minter / freeze authority)?
I saw this too.  Was looking for example code showing an example transaction sent, receiving a timeout, and then sending again....but I didn't see it here.  But I clicked into the mango link and this looks promising.  I'll give it a shot.  Thanks!
with publickey of the token (first param) and publickey of the user wallet (second param), way simpler than the old version instantiating the token

Here‚Äôs what I tried - 
```js
const { clusterApiUrl, Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

(async () => {
    const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl('mainnet-beta'), 'finalized');

    const transaction = await connection.getParsedTransaction('4TzPFzbWG4eFTdLXCrWYAv8VaPc7kgtgKorNqfPi9HzpcLLXe5ZmVYVSZkobKk8BCHQBgWJmmLKGLeWWkGH9qNkV');
    console.log(transaction.transaction.message);
})();```
Hey everyone, when I run cargo build-bpf inside my program it builds successfully but then it prints this out to the terminal instead of the usual solana program deploy <PATH>' I have never seen this before anyone know what it means?
`Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2m 35s`

Can I see your call?
Hi guys i am using solana web3.js and calling the getBlock() method but it returns Error: failed to get confirmed block: Block not available for slot 127173784... However when i look up the solanablock explorer i see that the slot is there, any ideas as to why this is happening?I am using devnet
Thank you! glad I asked this question here, very helpful suggestion.
Good night! We are running a lot of tests using solana-test-validator, is there an example config for /root/.config/solana/cli/config.yml with all available settings? The thing is we have a lot of programs to deploy and some of them require waiting for "finalized" commitment. We have only one validator in tests, is there any way to speed up finalized commitment or another general way to speed up txs processing? Waiting for "confirmed" doesn't help for some instructions, is there a way to lower max lockout maybe?
Thanks for any help!
checking whether they're winner can all be done client side
just write the winner pubkey to the lottery account when they claim
Yes that is what I thought. But I  forgot to mention one more requirement for the app: maintain list of daily, weekly, monthly top winners and I cant think of any good method of cathcing this data.
don't? let the winner claim
Hello Veterans, can you help me with the question?
So there is a  lottery app where users buy tickets.  I am going to keep each user ticket as PDA derived from users address + Lottery ID. 
Let say 50,000 people bought tickets. What will be the best method to identify the winners? How can I query all 50,000 PDA accounts to find out winning numbers?
just dont use the Token class. Use the instructions and or separate calls instead.  look at the new docs to see the similar calls and instructions.  https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/token/js/index.html
for the token program and associated token account, the token account address needs to exist, otherwise be created, meaning someone needs to pay for the account. so making sure its created, or creating the account if not, (allow funded is a CLI path for this), to ensure the user has a token account that can actually receive what your sending, makes sense, and how its done.
makes sense right? units is amount of compute, so generally that would be the case.
quotes are all over the place and based on supply and demand.  they def are not getting cheaper on avg.  there are several firms and more on boarding. I would research and reach out to many.  Otherwise your best off in the interim reviewing related security tools and guides from neodyme and soteria, and related.  can only do what you can do.
generally when u send a transactions you get the signature,  signature is the same as a tx Id. 
look at the wallet adapter tab for a quick simple example.  
methods like send and confirm try to wrap everything for you and is not 'wallet adapter' friendly.

Thx.  Was looking at Ubuntu workstations
most running on a linux ubuntu or mac, and mac m1.  but the landscape is diverse. less windows overall because of linux support but you can run WSL/Ubuntu without issues as well.  VMs and docker are also used.
Anyone have good recommendations on an auditing firm less than $200K?
is it normal to get a 200KB wasm file?
what's the average fungible token SC size in KBs?
Noob question: what kind of workstation do you guys use to develop on Solana?  I assume most use some kind of Linux build?
How can I get the txid from a Transaction using @solana/web3.js?
```
new splToken.Token(this.connection, mintPublicKey, splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, this.ownerKeyPair);

splToken.Token.createTransferInstruction()
```
How can I work instead of above function on the new version?
I can't find `new splToken.Token` on new version
How do I have to use function on the new spl-token version instead of `import splToken from '@solana/spl-token'`?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I think that in terms of terminology, every transaction requires a signer because it must have a fee payer (who must sign), but you can read state without a transaction/fees/a signer
also does every transaction require a signer or does it work like ethereum where you only need a signer if you are changing the state of the blockchain?
and it works, thank you!
it compiles at the very least
Is there any devnet dapp that support tokens? I Want to get some tokens on the test net, then fetch my balance trought web3js and finally send token from my address to any other address
Would that error be created if there are no tokens in that acc? No right?
It does exist

Example #1.1 SOL Transfer.
Hi guys, do you know easy way to get sent amount of lamports from transaction, something from solana web3 maybe?
Does `Buffer.from([1])` work?

Otherwise `alloc` can take a fill param, so `Buffer.alloc(1, 1)` maybe?
```let buffer = Buffer.alloc(1);
  buffer[0] = 1;
  const ix = new TransactionInstruction({
    keys: [],
    programId,
    data: buffer,
  });``` is there a better way of writing this out?
i just did it with empty wallet and it showed me that price ahah
Sounds about right! I‚Äôm away from my desktop but I think there‚Äôs a site that shows you the cost in lamports and then you just convert
seems its just 0.001sol something
oh ye i need to calculate exactly how much sol would i be needing just to create token and its account.
I just made 35 million of them for like a couple dollars
Virtually nothing
Hi, how much does it cost to create a token in mainnet?
any Idea why that could be happening
hey no matter what devnet rpc enpoint I use, my Candy machine gpa calls are blocked (410 gone)
I want to start working with solana with rust, are there any simple example projects on github for noobs like me?
anyone know how to merge tokens?
as long as the token account exist, and the from exists, it should be ok. ill check back in
*different address
*works fine on testnet
i am gonna keep trying
ill circle back.   in the mean time, ripping out the getOrCreate Logic being wrapped and calling it yourself might lead you to a better answer/result.

this is generally thrown when the token account is not found.
just tokens for staking rewards
NFT is 0, if that is the intent.
when i made my whitelist tokens i did decimal 0 so they burned but dont think that is an issue for this use
when using create-token does it default to 9? fine to just leave it?
decimal matters.  standard 9, common is also 6 for more.  NFT is 0
0.2.0
which version of the spl-token is this?
some are saying decimal 0 some are saying doesnt matter
anyone know what decimal i should be creating my tokens at? they will be used for staking

what are you doing to get token not found.  ?  details. how your getting this error. the code/command
so that is a token mint.  right.
it says the TokenAccountNotFoundError
gotcha.  so whats the issue?
thats the token
is that the one your transfering to or from?
yep i did ^^^
https://explorer.solana.com/address/ptX2XE63jdoA3x9tX1SUgVQpBStgi2516Q4xKR5pWq4
did you create the token account on mainnet?
u can literally check out the token on the main net with the solana explorer
i know of that
yeah
creating a token account on a network only creates it on that network.
i havent supplied the 2 address shown below
adding a console log inside the package from where the error is throw shows some random address which i dont know of
ok so the thing is i have setup a system to trasnfer tokens which works excellent on the testnet but when i switch to main net beta and change the token address to the one i intend to trasnfer onthe mainnet it shows token account does not exist
yeah now only if give me some directions how to sign message he will be superman! üòÑ why there are no methods in solana web3js for this functionality
whats the issue?
i dont understand why the token seems non existent
<@788215642070581289> is pretty amazing üôÇ
so its a token issue
switching to devnet and changing the tokens with the same wallets works fine
they are normal wallets
hi
how can I address this error:
`'Program failed to complete: exceeded maximum number of instructions allowed 200000`
maybe just check your fromTokenAccount and toTokenAccount address are both token accounts. also check your connection. it is hard from my side to debug.
do you have any example for signing message i've used this but not quite working for me ;s:

```
const buffer = Buffer.from(message);

const signature =                                                      nacl.sign.detached(buffer,base58.decode(base58.encode(this.signer.secretKey)));

return base58.encode(signature);
```
gosh you are amazing! ‚ù§Ô∏è
you can use https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs58 to encode your secretKey

Hey! I am getting this weird error `TokenAccountNotFoundError` which means that the token is invalid but i can literally look at it from the solana explorer.

Seems correct
That one is for the actual wallet
Can someone point me to resources where I can learn how to request a wallet to pay the transaction fee from a spl-token transfer from the "server" wallet?
Should I start by signing the transaction in the server side then send the transaction to the wallet to finish the transaction paying the fee and signing  it?
im trying to understand all of these program
cant find ones that working

im stuck when i have to install the cli tools
hi can anyone help me with this? i cant install Solana CLI Tools, for NFT deployment. Sorry for the basic question, thank you
interesting
But at any rate, associated token accounts always start off life with the user-level owner you'd expect, but weirdly, they don't have to stay that way‚Äîthey're just token accounts under the hood (it's only their address that's special), so you can transfer user-level ownership off to someone else. Doing so is pretty confusing though, since then [person P, mint M]'s ATA is somehow owned by some other person Q (unexpected but possible).
Interestingly, no‚Äîbut I think you're also confused about what "owner" means here. There are two notions of ownership: *program* ownership and user-level ownership. Every account has a program owner, which is the one-and-only thing that can mutate the account's data or spend the account's money; in this case, every token account is program-owned by the spl token program. But token accounts also have a user-level owner (not a perfect term), which is the person/thing/whatever that logically owns the tokens.
is ATA owner and the Authority same always? I confused about the structure of ATA Account, since I think it also owned by the Token Program.
99% sure you can. I can give you better information in an hour or so
Yeah, once I get to my workstation I will send you some code on how I do it.

hey guys, I am getting a random issue in devnet that I dont get when running my local validator so I am wondering what version of code is devNet?
That‚Äôs a problem then.
I went to their discord and they said there wasn't a way to do it without running a verifier node, which takes a lot of hardware (256GB ram, etc)
I'd be interested to know if you can find a way of setting up a listener
Yeah I was looking for an easy way to download 24 hours worth of blocks and they didn't have it.
`@solana/web3.js` doesn‚Äôt have event listener for blocks yet?

is there something wrong with devnet?? im not able to send nft from my phantom wallet, i get an error for every address ad nft im trying....?
Thanks for that resource. But one question regarding programs: If person A wants to get a custom Token from person B paying with SOL in exchange, is it necessary to create a PDA for storing SOL or can I send the payment directly to the program's account? It needs to be stored until person B takes the trade.

Hi, suppose, there is a token owned by WalletA and WalletA wants to sell it. Now this token needs to be transfered to WalletB (i.e. any random wallet who is willing to buy this token). 

So now, how can I transfer token from WalletA to WalletB obeying one conditions that WalletA is not online(for signing the transaction) when WalletB is trying to buy.
(programatically in web3/chain_program)

Do I make my program, the owner of token when WalletA wants to sell the token ? can using delegates help ? ...  Any other good solution ?(apart from metaplex)

Hello good day,
Anyone has an idea on if it is possible to make and deploy music NFTs on the Solana

The failure I get is `FAIL ProgramNotParsable` ,

which suggests that the lido program that owns that account `CrX7kMhLC3cSsXJdT7JDgqrRVWGnUpX3gfEfxxU2NVLi` is not the value I should be passing as a secondary argument to `parse_account_data`

Any suggestions?
Hey Folks, I am trying to deserialize the data stored inside of Lido's account (`49Yi1TKkNyYjPAFdR9LBvoHcUjuPX4Df5T5yv39w2XTn`) 

but I am somewhat confused about what params to give Solana's `parse_account_data` method (source: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/account-decoder/src/parse_account_data.rs)

this is what I am up to:

```
    let lido_account = String::from("49Yi1TKkNyYjPAFdR9LBvoHcUjuPX4Df5T5yv39w2XTn");
    let lido_pb = lido_account.parse::<Pubkey>()?;

    let acc = solana_client.get_account(&lido_pb).await?;

    let bla = parse_account_data(&lido_pb, &acc.owner(), &acc.data, None);
    // let data = try_from_slice_unchecked(&acc.data);
    match bla {
        Ok(data) => println!("SUCCESS {:#?}", data),
        Err(data) => println!("FAIL {:#?}", data),

hello, I am trying to fork solana token list but it says that no more forks can be created, can someone help?
the signature is used to represent the transaction you further have to fetch the details of the signature to get the transaction hash from it
hey guys how to take hash from transaction, i can see array of signatures that contains the hash but is it guarantee that the hash will be always first or last argument in that array or something like this?
calls
what can be the challenges ..also if anyone can provide any docker image or method to setup private node for my RPC calss
is it effective to create your own private node for RPC calls on solana chain or we should use some third party service
ty for the answer ser ‚ù§Ô∏è
https://github.com/Niceboy0829/Solana_NFT_Marketplace/blob/main/programs/test-stake/src/lib.rs#L167-#L169                                                                    ***    Error:-***  cannot find type `ProgramAccount` in this scope
not found in this scope
on Ethereum yeah. Guess there's not alternative on solana?
archive node is a thing in some other chain?
a service that runs an archive node for you basically
Is there something similar to ethereum "toChecksumAddress" (https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-utils.html#tochecksumaddress) to convert upper or lowercase solana addresses into the valid one?
sry I don't know what alchemy is
that's fair, might really be an overkill. Is there any archive node providers like alchemy available?
You'll need a beefy machine to run it though, just like mainnet. The full state won't really load on a 8GB RAM laptop. For integration testing purposes this may be overkill or a little too painful to use.
Cool, I just want to mock some oracle responses, so that should help me do it I guess
yes, you can use `solana-ledger-tool create-snapshot --bootstrap-validator ...` to modify a mainnet snapshot such that all the validators vote accounts are deleted and replaced with yours.  This effectively allows you do boot a local cluster with all the mainnet state.
Example at https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/multinode-demo/setup-from-mainnet-beta.sh#L51-L59
It's not used very often, there may be dragons
is there a way to run a local fork of mainnet like you can with eth usign alchemy/infura with hardhat?
Thanks for the reply.  I got the following to compile using the bincode::deserialize:

```rust
use bincode::{
    deserialize,
    Result as BincodeResult
};
let deserialize_result: BincodeResult<Transaction> = deserialize(array);

        if deserialize_result.is_err() {
            return Err(Status::internal("failed to deserialize"));
        }
        
```
it depends, how was it serialized?  but here is an overview and examples with borsh.
https://solanacookbook.com/guides/serialization.html#how-to-deserialize-instruction-data-on-the-program

the governance program and solana program library have many different examples as well. 
search on `deserialize` for a relatable example.
Hello, how does one deserialize an u8 array into a Transaction?

I am using:

```rust
let tx: Transaction = deserialize(array).unwrap();
```
the call is not going away yet, as far as I know. it has no deprecation warning.  but because of how taxing the call can be, and has started to be, validators or other services may be handling this differently in the future and expose other services to handle load where able - i believe this future is still evolving.  For now its probably best to reach out to any RPC provider your using in terms of consistency, future route and longevity.  Thats about as good as I can do for now until we find out more. What I would do if I wanted more access and control is start running my own node and take over my own customize and fine tune from there, allowing you to do whatever you want with the data being captured.
<@788215642070581289> any chance you might know ser?
Depends I guess. For example I subscribe to the token program. I get a lot of returns that have not been modified. I just assume they are rent checks or something similar and ignore them.

`The parsed transaction API only parses a few types of instructions (stake, vote, spl-token, etc). It doesn't support parsing instructions for other programs yet.`
Thank you again!

hey <@788215642070581289> the parsed version of getTransaction did the trick üòÑ
hey guys , where to find the meaning of "failed: custom program error: 0x2d"?
now I am going to try to get the amount üòÑ
thanks! I use confirmTransaction and now works
there are some confirmed methods in web3 js you can check.
Hey guys, do we have any tutorial to create any DAO in solana, (programatically)
yeah well, the problem now is sendRawTransaction doesn't return when transaction is confirmed so I can't use getTransaction
bah, I missed the docs, preflight has nothing to do with it
Anyone is familiar with this problem?

but looks like the commitment is ignored
const txHash = await this.connection.sendRawTransaction(
                    serializedTransaction,
                    {preflightCommitment: 'confirmed'}
                );
I am trying to do this
I think I have to add a preflightcommitment
that's what the docs says
"Fetch parsed transaction details for a confirmed or finalized transaction"
it's suppose to be confirmed after return right?
:/
how can I make sendRawTransaction return when confirmed?
getParsedTransactions says will work on confirmed transactions
I am using getParsedTransaction, I don't know the endpoint behind the method
Yeah because if I use the hash a few seconds later it works
what's the endpoint you're using?  if you get an old tx from your owned node it may return you null because not all nodes is full sync.
I think I have to add a commitment right?
<@788215642070581289> I am using getParsedTransaction but the thing right now is I am getting null for my sendrawtransaction
you will get a better support for NFTs <#937905165074300999>
Can someone point me to the documentation on the program execution environment? I'm looking for something similar to the X86/64 ABI (https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/x86_64-abi-0.99.pdf), but for Solana. Does anything exist that extensively documents the execution process and environment?
use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction and there are two ways to do it.
if you just need to know the balance changes, you can use pre/post balance field
if you need to specific know the value transferred by system program, you need to parse all instructions
Does anybody knows how to get the amoun transfered from a transaction?
is inside parsed
it's the owner, always the same, the program
haha
nope
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks!
using getParsedAccountInfo I get the owner
yeap
I think if you get the account info of the public key the data should include the owner
getParsedAccountInfo?
get the owner?
It's possible to revert getAssociatedTokenAddress? I mean, based on the tokenAccount get the public key of the wallet?
Oh ok yeah makes sense, thank you very much! <@134416332509675520> <@785084693023424542>
you can use the traditional wallet spl-token transfer related methods, where it queries the user to sign/approve transaction.  for example with wallet here is a send: https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold/blob/main/src/components/SendTransaction.tsx#L17

and you may want to use the createTransferInstruction for SPL-Token transfers:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/48fbb5b7/token/js/src/instructions/transferChecked.ts#L42
sending sol example:
https://solanacookbook.com/references/basic-transactions.html#how-to-send-sol
No, not possible (no wallet will ever give out the secret key like that). You would need to use the wallet's API to ask it to sign the tx for you (so can't use that specific sendAndConfirmTransaction thing, at least not like that)
Got it from `const response = await solana.connect()`
Seems like payer in window.solana is just the `publicKey` but the method expects a signer object with both the `publicKey` and the `secretKey`
Specifically this line: `await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, tx, [payer])`
Does someone knows if it's possible to get the secretKey from the window.solana object or something? 

I'm trying to implement solana pay in the web for a simple sol transfer from wallet to wallet via phantom, but I'm getting an error in the `sendAndConfirmTransaction` method.
now its dpeloyed and it works
literally just kept trying the EXACT same thing over and over...
FYI finally succeeded!
anyone have ideas?
im trying to load a lot of accounts with the solana-test-validator and am getting a 'too many arguments' error
I think it's unfortunately just the rpc infrastructure having a hard time :/
the exact same bytecode, programId, declared programId and deployer works just fine on devnet....
Solana FM looks great but not sure it has what I need, what are the names of some other data providers that allow you to query historical data? anyone?
I see that there are a bunch of buffer accounts with funds that must have been set aside to cover rent? i am able to reclaim these so that made my day...
https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-thzat9?file=index.ts
Ok I will be more descriptive...
In that code there is a function called claimReturned...
We will make a refund.
Where the user send a spl-token and get some SOL back...
That code works perfectly in devnet, but have problems in mainnet I don't know why don't works in mainnet, I attach the log with the error
now getting an `Error: Custom: Invalid blockhash` if i try running the same command again
is that where the SOL comes from to complete the deployment?  and is it possible that it is insufficient?  i tried transferring SOL to this account and it was not successful
i see on the block explorer that the buffer account seems to have a balance approx equal to what the cost of the deployment is
question: what is actually happening when i specify the buffer?
I have seen that happen a lot usually with Json  key being wrong
üò∂
Just wondering when is solana team going to increase the tps?
Has anyone successfully installed solana dev tools on an M1 Mac?
This was upon deploying with `solana program deploy --buffer recover.json /home/jay/dev/solana/aquarius/target/deploy/chain.so` from a recovered buffer account
got through all the 'X retries remaining' and then sat on this for a while:
`[0/1] Finalizing transaction 2cvuTRnMqwd59YTpLLWGbT73B3Rub2ooRJcZgn7A9DeTH1YobHWwdNMcKcUPy9c11YfHV1DDYfEY3if24JX8WvPX`
and then go this:
`Error: Deploying program failed: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds`
And there is definitely sufficient funds in the wallet deploying the program.
clearly the validators have algorithms that decide which transactions to include in the block?
once again, why does it rush through the first 400 transactions of the deployment and then drag through the last 10, only to timeout 5 times (~1500 blocks later) and then fail due to too many retries?
tried redeploying using the recover.json, after the command it hang for 5 min then gave me a:
Error: Custom: Invalid blockhash
also when i execute the 'deploy' command, why does it just hang for like 5 min before providing any output?
something like...  'simulating transaction' or 'connecting to validator' would be helpful instead of blinking cursor
Hello. No AVX V2 on my CPU. Is there a way to run a solana-test-validator without it?
It's because that URL is not up to date, for whatever reason...
Download from here:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/download/v1.9.14/solana-install-init-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe
Then:
solana-install-init-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe -v1.9.14
Then:
solana-install update
is there a way to get more info about the error?
which address?
Ive tried redeploying a few times.  Looks like there are about 300+ transactions in the deployment. The first 90% always go quick, the last 10% burns through a couple of retries, and the last 1-2 transactions burn through a couplr of retries
Maybe address is not correct
Can someone please explain this to me:
```
==========================================================================
To resume a deploy, pass the recovered keypair as the
[BUFFER_SIGNER] to `solana program deploy` or `solana write-buffer'.
Or to recover the account's lamports, pass it as the
[BUFFER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS] argument to `solana program close`.
==========================================================================
Error: Data writes to account failed: Custom error: Max retries exceeded
There was a problem deploying: Output { status: ExitStatus(unix_wait_status(256)), stdout: "", stderr: "" }.
```
This program has been deployed successfully to devnet, but this is happening with mainnet beta
Only thing I can think of is it requires C++ runtimes installed.
interesting. which high performant based blockchains are you familiar with that have easily accessible data availability in terms of what you are describing?
I'm sorry to hear there is such a high barrier for entry to poke around and do some data science on the Solana. One of my favorite things about a lot of blockchains is how accessible their data is.
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/instruction.rs#L285
```let instruction = Instruction::new_with_bytes(
        program.pubkey(),
        &[0],
        vec![AccountMeta::new(greeting_pubkey, false)],     // what does this line mean? 
    );```
what exactly is the issue?  just saying they do not work is not very descriptive..
its helpful when you give context, any thoughts on why, and which ones specifically, the errors, etc.
i believe its been recommended to use find_program_address, as its for off curve (pda) addresses, wheree the signer can only be program generated on chain using 'seeds' to sign on chain. I believe create_account_with_seed can still be used, its just not as common.
Hello to all I have these function that works in devnet but don't works in mainnet, any help?
These is the link of the code:
https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-thzat9?file=index.ts
would this ```let instruction = solana_sdk::system_instruction::create_account_with_seed(
            &player.pubkey(),
            &greeting_pubkey,
            &player.pubkey(),
            utils::get_greeting_seed(),
            lamport_requirement,
            utils::get_greeting_data_size()? as u64,
            &program.pubkey(),
        );
        let message = Message::new(&[instruction], Some(&player.pubkey()));
        let transaction =
            Transaction::new(&[player], message, connection.get_recent_blockhash()?.0);

        connection.send_and_confirm_transaction(&transaction)?;```
be a PDA?
thabk u !!!!!!!
https://solanacookbook.com/references/programs.html#how-to-create-a-pda
if you want all blocks for any duration, consistently, finding and using an RPC provider with an API/Interface for this, or running your own and interfacing/accessing it is probably best.  general use api calls for getting that much data doesnt make much sense. it would be a lot of data..
how would i create a PDA using rust client?
<@445425471027544095> Thank you!!
Am I missing something?
This looks like a tutorial and tool for validators to save the responses for common rpc requests to a database, but I don't see how this helps someone trying to request the data.
After looking through that for quite a while, I finally realized I was trying to use bincode::deserialize instead of T::decode for protobuf transformation, which wasn't going to work. Thanks
you may be interested in resources like this mentioned above and in discord search:

Is this the best way available to download blocks for free? And about how large would 24 hours of blocks be?
The rpc api seems to have a good api method for getting multiple blocks at once, but I also saw that there is a rate limit on 100MB per 30s.
I'm working on a personal project around on-chain analysis. Is there a good way to quickly download all blocks produced in a given 24-hour period?

Yep. I just have his mint token
You want to get the metadata for an NFT?
Can I get the metadata of an NFT from his mint token only ?
just found it, thanks again
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#configuring-state-commitment
thank you <@793009052879028254>
silly me!
didn't tried that one - let me check it
are you passing the commitment = confirmed option? 
```    "method": "getSignaturesForAddress",
    "params": [
        "83astBRguLMdt2h5U1Tpdq5tjFoJ6noeGwaY3mDLVcri",

no list on hand about historical data, but there are RPCs that provide historical nodes for getting data, Solana FM and some others provide data through queries, but as far as adhoc historical queries you may need to check with them. I am interested in creating a list/guide for doing this - as it has started to come up more.
Hello Team, I am looking to develop a payment system on top of Solana, something similar to Solana Pay. I tested getSignaturesForAddress RPC call but it seems It does not return tr. sig. quick enough (takes  ~1 min to get it)  despite that in my wallet I can already see the transaction being confirmed literally couple of seconds after creating.
My questions are: 
1. is there faster way to get/detect the transaction before being confirmed (at broadcast level) for certain address
2. could it be me having slow responses from Solana explorer because I am not running my own private explorer but relying on public one? I have also tested against paid nodes but still the same.
Thank you!
is there anyway to check a user's token balance historically using the API? or do I have to use something like my own bigtable? does anybody know of a SAAS apps that offer access to such historical data?
Have you checked the `bigtable` subcommand of `solana-ledger-tool`?  That code pretty much exercises all the BigTable columns in one way or another, you can probably find a reference in there to give you some clues as to how to resolve your problem: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/ledger-tool/src/bigtable.rs
<@585868308419444749>  Hi guys, I am on the same team as <@963101043124764712> . We have been working on this for months. We would greatly appreciate if anyone can help.
still need an answer to this üôè

I know about geiser, but more importantly for now I need to know whether the front-end apps we have will go out of service soon (if the call is going away) üôÇ
Yep, PDAness is just about the address of the account and how you sign for it‚Äîit doesn't really affect the account itself (small asterisk since accounts at PDA can only be 10kb in size vs. the normal 10mb max). But the important thing is that just because an address was derived from some program doesn't mean that the *account* that lives there is *owned* by that same program
do i also use this when making a PDA?
probably convert that `Buffer`?
Here is the error
It's the `system_instruction::assign` instruction
This makes so much sense. Thank you. What function would i use to assign the owner for that only time?
This is because you want/need the invariant that any data in an account *was definitely written by the program that owns it*. Being able to reassign program ownership would be complete chaos because you could, for example, make a fake+loaded USDC account owned by your bogus program and then reassign ownership to the actual token program, which would then make it look like you had a valid USDC account.
> an account is owned by the system program by default. the system program has basic functions for creating more accounts and sending lamports and such and such. **accounts can be assigned a new owner once and only once.** this owner is always a program, which has permission to deduct lamports from the account and modify its data however it wishes
> https://2501babe.github.io/posts/solana101.html

why can a new owner be assigned only once?
I can't use nacl for verify a signedMessage and I don't understand why..
Hello all I‚Äôm extremely new to everything related to development in blockchain solana, I have a site which will have transactions with eventpoints and Those points can be bought 1$ to 1ep someone told me I could look into blockchain to create some kind of currency (tokens) for my site and someone would have those in their wallet thus making the site transactions a little more secure, but i noticed that the price for the tokens created should be set with liquidity which would mean have a ton of money allocated from the beginning, any feedback on the main idea, could it work? Should I instead look for other ways?  My apologies if this should go in another chat.
ok, that's enough.  you've been warned enough times
I will try but I think I already test it and it doesn‚Äôt work too
Hi there, I'm struggling to find spots outside of fiver to hire Solana smart contract devs. Any good resources for this? (Contract owrk)

So just to make sure, you are trying to install solana cli on windows, right?
been trying for 3 days üò¶
nope
Did you get it working?
sockets also depend on the receiver/provider, and based on the RPC, may have certain limitations or bandwidth to deal with. you may have to re instantiate or do some of your own handling to resub or open as well, as the nature of sockets is not 100% reliable especially without dedicated connections
For windows you need to use an older version
The url in the docs is incorrect. If you use that you will curl a "file" that says access denied in it.
re-instantiation of the class solves the problem
but that doesn't seem to work sometimes
checking the source code, it seems that it should try to reconnect itself
Hello, the web3 js library is throwing with "socket not ready" sometimes
yea tried diffrent location
looks like windows 10? im guessing had a problem executing the command for some reason.

Getting this error when trying to do download
Just don't know what to do with the response
this one https://api.magiceden.dev/#82874536-9430-4dae-81dc-1235baaa3ef3, exactly like that, the response is also the same like the example
whats the api your getting the response from?
Yeah I know but everybody is busy, I approached them but haven't heard back
It seems that the type is Buffer but I don't know what to do with it
they have a discord
https://discord.com/invite/b87UnCy6P2
They do have an example in JS that I don't understand....
Just dont know what to do with it
I basically get a response like this https://api.magiceden.dev/#82874536-9430-4dae-81dc-1235baaa3ef3
what api are you getting instructions from that come in byte only form?
What do you mean?
it sounds like your trying to scrape transactions and reverse engineer and replay them.  is that accurate?  thats not really something you can do and the same transaction will not work.
So do I need to decode this first then?
But the transaction is in the form of bytes (like [1, 0 ,8, ...])
If you already have a transaction instruction you can use `transaction.add`
I dont know I thought we should use populate?
Why incorrect?
So basically if I do `transaction.add(Transaction_Instruction())`, this is not correct?
I'm opeing the python SDK now to find how to populate..
I'm not very familiar with JS
They build the transaction with `Transaction.populate(...)` and then use `program.provider.send` to execute it
What parts are you having trouble following?

but I get these errors
Hey so im trying to download solana ts
ok solved this. You should just use `./cargo nightly bench` because solana repo comes packages with the correct rust version
Hey everybody! So I'm kind of stuck in something! How can i make sure that my transaction is through before proceeding with further code? I'm already using simulate transaction method to make sure there's nothing wrong with the transaction!
Ah and there's JS example that I couldn't understand here, including requesting the api
https://api.magiceden.dev/#82874536-9430-4dae-81dc-1235baaa3ef3
Someone said that the instruction already includes all the data so I dont need to specify `program_id` and `keys` anymore (so I don't need to create a new transaction, just execute it, but I don't know how to do this)
Basically create a transaction yeah... But what I do is actually request a transaction instruction from an api and I got a response and I want to execute it...
Yeah seen it already
have you seen cookbook?  https://solanacookbook.com/  is there an example there that relates or is close?
what are you trying to accomplish?  create a transaction?
But the transaction failed
I have added some accountmeta to `keys`, find appropiate `program_id` and put the bytes file I got from the api to `data`
`tx.add(Transaction_Instruction(keys= , program_id=, data=))`
hmm..   the cpu target build, machine changed the key maybe? let me know if u find out, but i dont believe the key should get gend if its there
`tx = Transaction()`
Basically so far what I do is this
i used the same computer I deployed with previously even though they are both pointing to the same keys
what did you do to fix?
i need to look into it more
but its fixed now
yeah it is the same but i deployed one on an ARM machine and i tried redeploying another on a nonARM and it deployed to a different address
Hello, I want to execute a transaction instruction.. I request a transaction and I got a response of transaction instruction in the form of bytes (e.g. [1, 0 ,8, ...]).. How do I execute this transaction? So far I used python sdk
so the target has keypair files, right, generally, and when they exist they use the same id, when they dont, they are generated.
and its a .so file why does it matter if its native or anchor
its the same keypair
hmm this native or anchor?  the same key used?
hmm interesting. not sure ive seen this done yet

Hey!

Can somebody help me linking geyser plugin with my local node to fetch all txs done on local node.

Here's what I found:
```
start the validator with the plugin by using the --geyser-plugin-config argument
``` from here: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres/#create-the-schema-objects

Currently I'm able to setup local node and run the above repo:
- creation of DB and schema
- cargo build

Any flow that I'm missing would be highly appreciated to know.

hey, 
my Issue:
- bankclient throws error: `TransactionError(InvalidRentPayingAccount)`
I can only create rent-exempt accounts successfully.

Goal:
- when using the bankclient for testing our solana program I need to create a non-rentexempt pda (1 epoch rent)

Is there a fix for this? 
I don't wanna have to change code to switch between whats in production and what's able to run tests.
+ resolve the promise  (onfulfilled, onrejected)
check web3.js libary: 
you can specify your custom confirmoptions -> commitment -> finalized
i.e. in sendAndConfirmTransaction()

I'm using typescript and I figured out how to make it send the transaction and wait for it to create it before continuing to execute the function call, but I need it to wait until the transaction has actually been completed successfully (rather than completing or failing).

I've been stuck on this since I'm a bit newer to solana interactions (and tyepscript tbh), especially since I don't have the private keys and had to deal with the wallet adapter objects.
ah yeah you have to rewind it back to it. and yeah its definitely a huge bug
i can do it again.. no problem.. the problem is that my program listed my nft, and when i wanted to update pda with current new data, it faild.. so my nft is locked in a pda i have no access too.. this is a huge bug... program should be atomic, as far as i know
i noticed Solana team upload a patch for devenet two days ago.. since then, some things are broken...
just try again it will work fine right? or is it continuously throwing that error?
i cant... i have to use the getAccountInfo rpc... it worked fine all day....
Odd, seeing as other people are having this issue. RPC issue. Try a different RPC
end point ?? im using the devnet RPC
yeah been receiving this error since 2 days? idk whats going on down there
What endpoint as you using?
const escrowKeypair = new Keypair();
.
.
.
.
const escrowAccount = await connection.getAccountInfo(
    escrowKeypair.publicKey
  );
Show what is throwing the error
how come this happens ??? 

Error: failed to get info about account 5J7uwxUFuerToactAhyb3rV9TWmQ5hvPdYHq5z2Gpc3T: Error: 503 Service Unavailable: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":503,"message":"Service unavailable"}, "id": null}

503 ??? this error is so random.. it also didnt revert my program instruction.. huge bug ?
can i have sample code how to get transaction fee of a solana transaction
Never mind. It was an Ad-Blocker that was causing all this.
Hello. I am trying to connect with explorer.sloana.com to `http://localhost:8899/` and keep getting:

Any ideas anyone. I guess must be some security setting in web browser.
IIRC anyone with current authority can set authority to null/none to prevent anyone having authority going forward
Does anyone know when `mint_authority` can be empty in mint account? (https://docs.rs/solana-account-decoder/1.10.8/solana_account_decoder/parse_token/struct.UiMint.html)
sorry I do not know. I don't use ws yet.
yeah i know... im using that.. and when program is triggered i get the pda and i can ask the pda for the status.. the problem is when i need to ask the pda for status but the pda is already closed.... any idea??? thank btw
maybe this: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#subscription-websocket
Thanks!
okay thanks bro
I am creating wallets and testing things on the devnet, feel free to pm me
Do anyone know solana support rust Queue Data Structure?
anybody have an idea how to listen to events - same as in eth???
You can see that here: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/pubkey.rs#L18. So each seed can be max 32 bytes, and you can up 16 of them
What is the max size of the seed to use for a PDA?\
is there a way to verify the status of my escrow program? lets say i want to know when a user cancel his listing.. i know i can check the pda, but in this case (of cancel listing) i am closing the pda account.. any idea?
Thanks a lot. I use devnet for now
the wallet that will create the tokens, it produced from solana-keygen
no need to paste it, but what type of content is in your airdrop.json?
which network?  you can use/look at solana logs --help  to see what may work for you, and you can target the network and potentially info
where can I see the logs? is there any specific path that are being store?
alright got it
hard to say for certain what the future holds, but if they allow it to be referenced in program, id say its a safe a bet as you can get for now.  backwards compatibility is something everyone tries hard to maintain as much as possible.
you can get more details in the feature proposal description. i havent had time to explore that specific one as of yet. in github, docs, and using the id named/related `solana feature status`  should have realloc in the desc.
So not much point to those sysvars going forward? Thanks for the response. Just quenching some curiosity
yeah so in near future we will be able to reallocate the size ?
sounds like you ran out of space for your deploy.  account reallocation is an incoming feature.   in general when you want to deploy something you want to estimate and consider the size of the future program and its being built.  you can specify this on initial deploy.  not after.
tried this solana program deploy --max-len 200000000
Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 0: account data too small for instruction
hi team anyone knows how to increase size of smart contract whic is already deployed?
initially many variables had to be passed. so referencing in program without passing is an option and update for some sysvars.
Question: stuff like rent is hardcoded so what's the point of the sysvar account? Historical? Future-proofing? I don't see passing it into the program if I can already access the hardcoded stuff.
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/rent.rs
https://explorer.solana.com/address/SysvarRent111111111111111111111111111111111
no. node and front end projects generally have other config, basically something in token-swap, or conflicting in your existing packages is conflicting with the build process. doing it in cloud potentially throws other variables in the mix based on further config.  try compiling isolated token-swap separately. and get modules working individually to test properly and narrow down the issue.  unfortunately front ends have also become more complicated than easy with all the esm related updates and packers and builders coming out.
would have to know more about the program..  its saying uninitialized account expected generally meaning a new account is expected by the program, and your passing an existing one possibly?  would need to see the program source and instructions, potentially the lib/method associated. as there is a conflict it seems in what is being pass and expected. if nothing actually changed there are account related updates being worked on. solana features status - and docs on those related updated and how they may affect env.
Should I send the `package.json?`
so yea its basically a simple node project
So the thing I am trying to run it in is Google cloud functions code. The `spl-token` package is working fine but `spl-token-swap` is showing this error.
not sure how your doing this, but it looks esm related - something with the package configuration and setup in whatever project your doing. there is probably some conflict with the setup and or packaging, potentially conflicting with whatever is being imported.
what is your actual question, its pretty vague?  the docs in general have that info. solanacookbook.com has more info in some plain simple terms.

in general all instructions are run in order and atomically, for a single transaction. failure does not go through and get applied.
<@785084693023424542> any info regarding this?
will check... any clue about this error:

instruction requires an uninitialized account

for this instruction:
const initEscrowIx = new TransactionInstruction({
    programId: escrowProgramId,
    keys: [
      { pubkey: account1KeyPair.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: false },
      {
        pubkey: tempNft1TokenAccountKeypair.publicKey,
        isSigner: false,
        isWritable: true,
      },
      { pubkey: escrowKeypair.publicKey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true },
      { pubkey: SYSVAR_RENT_PUBKEY, isSigner: false, isWritable: false },
      { pubkey: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, isSigner: false, isWritable: false },
    ],
    data: Buffer.from(
      Uint8Array.of(
        0,
        ...new BN(amountSolToReceive).toArray("le", 8),
        ...new BN(auctionEndsTimeStamp).toArray("le", 8)
      )
    ),
  });
this is not the problem on "how to" but the core design of solana. How was these designs
primarily for offline transactions, you can use a normal transfer tho.
I've read the whole source code of SPL token swap, however my question remains still. Is there a clear distinction between instructions and transaction in term of atomicity, Computational unit and other securities concerns
no other log message from running logging?   or viewing logs?   0x0 is still generally related to funding.
what is advance nonce?
nothing is wrong as far as I can tell.  503 is service unavail. different error. can happen for number of reasons. can try backup providers in this case as well. did you check `solana feature status`  for activations?  new activations or status may affect existing devnet programs
same msg
nothing more with verbose flag
but what about devnet ? is something wrong there?? yesterday i got lots of 503 errors from rpc....
program error: 0x1 ‚Äì insufficent funds in account
usually i recall thats a funding error, anymore info in the logs?  how about when running in verbose with `-v`?
just do a normal transfer?  solanacookbook.com
yes 10 sol
do you have any SOL in your account using to run that command?
Hi guys, what is advance nonce instruction?
can transfer sol without advance nonce instruction?
devnet
what network?
Hello guys I am trying to generate some spl tokens and I get this message "RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x0 [3 log messages]"
do you have any clue of what is going wrong?

Here is the command that I'm using:
spl-token create-token ~/.config/solana/airdrop.json --decimals 0
i had to remove a wallet i had beacuse i couldnt transfer SOL nor NFTS from it....

then, today in my program im getting this error:
Error processing Instruction 4: instruction requires an uninitialized account

but if i remove the initializtion instruction i get:
Error processing Instruction 1: instruction requires an initialized account
details?
is it just me or something is really off with solana ? im getting weird errors for things that worked two days ago.... was there any update recently ?
you may want to check out jupiter sdk and material on how they do routes. otherwise your doing something fairly unique and would be light on additional material.  outside of reading how the token-swap program works, and you can reference the farms spl-program as well.
that doesnt make sense.  a rust program on local host does not talk to devnet... that wallet is pointing to localhost, not devnet.  not sure what your trying to say here.  statement about error in general still stands.
wow thanks you

after you grind an address, you have a keypair.  pass that to spl-token create-token keypair.json     look at the --help for any further isntruction
this is when im trying to invoke a system instruction from a rust program on localhost. it is deployed on devnet
you are in localhost mode 
you can get the balance  by `solana balance` in command line
https://discord.gg/v8u6Bw6e
1) it shows you are connect to your localhost?  127.0.0.1.   
2) that message has nothing to do with network being down, afaik.
hi, is solana down I cannot get balance changes -
hi 
is there any anchor discord?
how can i use spl-token create-token but with custom address ? 
for example if i use this command i will get a new token address. but i want to have a custom adress which i get on solana-keygen grind
Hi, i've learn rust and I want to know a good way to learn solana development if someone know where I can do that, thanks

HI all, I'm developing a solana program similiar to SPL token swap however I will provide the mechanism to swap through multiple pools.

So far I'm having 2 approaches that I can use: 
 1. Just write an sdk to allow a transaction to be crafted from multiple instructions.
2. write an instruction to CPI to other pool programs.

So far I haven't seen a clear distinction in term of atomicity, Computational unit and other securities concerns between these 2 approaches. Is there some other material apart from https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/transactions I can read to better understand the situation and which approach to take?
üôÉ
Same in my case too
sometime it works and sometime it shows this error
i have sufficient funds and sometimes it works and somtimes doesnt? i am using metaplex contract
Hey guys! I am working on a Solana wallet. I want to get it security tested/audited. Is there any whitehat security testing service/consultant or company which does that? There is no rust program code involved and I am only using web3.js for the functionality.
Deploy it again or check u if have sufficient balance
Hi guys, what is advance nonce instruction?
can transfer sol without advance nonce instruction?
is there an api to get solana current tps?
```https://api.devnet.solana.com/ 503 (Service Unavailable)```
``` 503 Service Unavailable: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":503,"message":"Service unavailable"}, "id": null}

why i am getting this 503 error?
Then what to do because etherium even does not cost that much
too expensive
Can anyone please help is it correct or am i doing wrong bcz 1.3 SOL is very expensive compare to ETHEREIUM
guys I'm reading for SPL tokens can you confirm if my understandings are correct cuz this is totally new concept to me üòÑ 

1. Tokens are not stored on public address that is generated from seed rather Tokens are stored on Token Account that is generated from the public address on Solana and there is a mapping between public address and token address

2. All of the tokens are managed by SPL token: we provide instructions and SPL library are executing operations like mint/transfer
Hi, I want to enforce that my accounts are only created and initialized by my factory program. I use PDAs as account addresses and an account is only valid if its address is derived from the factory program. And inside the factory program, there is only one instruction that does both creating and initializing accounts. Are these sufficient?
Deploying simple hello world program on mainnet cost 1.3 SOL is it correct?
hi, quick question on metaplex candy machine - is it possible for it to recognize several whitelist tokens to offer different pricing ranges? TIA!
```/Users/ningfei/.cargo/env:10: parse error near `;;'```
i:
/Users/ningfei/.cargo/env:10: parse error near `;;'


Why do I get this error every time I enter the terminal?
cannot find any info about it
is it possible to retrieve when an account was created? at which block or slot?
Good morning üëã I‚Äôm struggling with one use case than can be easily achievable on Ethereum, but probably not supported yet on Solana.

We need to add SPL transfer restriction to our token. Tokens should be only transferable with creator approval. 

Our idea was to add whitelist repository with wallets/accounts addresses to check before every token transfer. If an account/wallet is there - transfer is possible.

As I go through the documentation, I can't see anything that will allow me to do that, could you help me where to start?
I'd like to know how to do both: from a program and from a client
Hi, I am facing some performance issues when transfering tokens via the NodeJS package `@solana/spl-token`: On devnet the code is running smoothly but when I switch to mainnet some of the transfers take ages (I even had to increase the timeout in the Connection because I ran into timeout errors quite often). On the other hand sometimes the transfer is quite quick but most of the time I have the timeout problem. I already tried a private endpoint but it did not help. Does anyone have an idea what might be the issue?

Hi, I have cloned this: https://github.com/Bonfida/bonfida-bot repo and trying to build the program but it's givig the error.
thank you so much i think this one will do the job: https://solanacookbook.com/references/keypairs-and-wallets.html#how-to-sign-and-verify-messages-with-wallets
you can use https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#serializeMessage to get a serialized message byte array
also check this flow https://solanacookbook.com/references/offline-transactions.html#offline-transaction
just signing them and returning the signed result
if you mean verify, it is written in the link I posted to you
but not sure how correct it is
right now i'm using:

```
const buffer = Buffer.from(message);

const signature = nacl.sign.detached(buffer, base58.decode(base58.encode(this.signer.secretKey)));

const signed = base58.encode(signature);


return signed;
```
https://solanacookbook.com/references/keypairs-and-wallets.html#how-to-sign-and-verify-messages-with-wallets
btw do you have any idea where i can check how to sign messages
i'll take a look, thank you!
yes. it is a mix result. it is not only SOL transfer.
you can take a look how explorer handle pre/post balance 
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/explorer/src/pages/TransactionDetailsPage.tsx#L365
and some of these balances are changed because of the transaction fee as well right?
yes but there are a'lot of values in pre/post balance and not sure how to handle them
pre/post balance will list all value changes in this tx. it will like xxx address cost/gain yyy lamports in this tx
is it good approach to iterate over these instructions and sum the values?
i see and there is no total value that can be extracted
Solana's tx is composed by instructions, and SOL transfer, token transfer, create account .... all of them are instructions.
I will say that a transaction has a lot of value, and it hide in instrucitons
For example if we were in Ethereum, there every transaction have `value` and this equals to sent amount of ETH in the transaction, here i try to achieve the same thing, get the solana asset sent in the transaction
if you just want to know lamports changes, there are two fileds, pre/post balance
you can take a look
i see thanks brotha, so is there any generic way to extract `Lamports` from any transaction
not all instruction will be parsed. for now it only parsed some build-in program instructions like system, token ...
createWithSeed isn't used to derive a PDA. you should use https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/PublicKey.html#findProgramAddress if your program use find_program_address
right now i do: `instruction?.parsed?.info?.lamports` but is not working every time
guys any idea how to extract lamports from `ParsedTransactionWithMeta` correctly
This is how I have created PDA
const senderPubkey = await web3.PublicKey.createWithSeed(
            mintPubkey, // public key of mint
            'sale',     // seed
            KSTORE_PROGRAM_ID   // program id of KSTORE
        );
How can I sign for this account(senderPubkey) in invoke_signed ?

I have tried following in KSTORE program
let (pubkey_pda, bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(&[
                        mint_account.key.as_ref(),
                        "sale".as_bytes(),
                        program_id.as_ref()
                    ], program_id);
But pubkey_pda does not match with senderPubkey

So using what seed can I obtain senderPubkey in my KSTORE program ?
I think you can build your own node. you can make some index in your own node to speed your some query.
there is an attribute you can use `--limit-ledger-size`

Hey does anybody know if there is a way to reduce space consumption by solana when running `solana-test-validator` ?
Hello, how can I get the lowest latency to listen to transactions from a program on Solana ?
Should I:
   - Use RPC / Websockets and a private RPC server (I used quicknode, are there some better ones with lower latencies)
  - Are there other ways than RPC and Websockets to go faster (e.g. running your own Solana node, or changing the code in rust, etc.), where should I look at
  - Is there a difference in latency between using JS or Rust
it went through finally
turns out, yes lol

That's this one: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/src/transaction/error.rs#L131 So you're leaving some account with too little rent (solana is change how rent is handled for new accounts)
Accepted!
I am testing `1.9.15` and getting error `InvalidRentPayingAccount` how to know what's bringing an account into that state? which account? Does that mean my code will be broken in `1.9.15` ?

Yea they resolved after a few minutes, was just ~3 minutes of 80% 503s for me, small sample size
from the docs
if we let it empty, default is 720
it make no sens, params is the limit return

seems that parameter needs to be between 0-1

btw is this the right channel to ask this?
not experiencing any issues personally.
what should I use for the other 2?
from my understanding I need 3 input here:
1. data (in form of binaries, I'm fine with this)
2. program_id
3. keys
and i want to do a transaction by using transaction_instruction
im not sure there is a good way to do it with cypress alone, may have to use puppeteer or some other work around. you generally cant run headless with certain tools. this is primarily related to plugins, so you may have to google on this aspect of testing plugins for the browser with your test suite.
i use python sdk mostly
So anyway I need to ask guys
are you an expert in solana? üòÖ
Hello any expert here?
There's no such thing as validating your account scammer
or u should reconnect ur wallet
have you validated your account
Hi guys i am trying to integrate solana into our exchange and am curious about the fee structure is it correct that a normal solana transaction will always cost 5000 lamports?

contact the protocol of the LP or figure out how to calculate based on the LP Account. otherwise based on implementation it is specific to a protocol. in general for tokens, you can query a token balance using the spl-token lib/program based on your client for a token account.
i'm currently only able to find the number of LP tokens i have, but i'd like to be able to calculate what tokens that consists of
is there a way to make an RPC call to see the reserves of an LP?
whats the context?  if your connecting there is no real spec per say, its just RPC calls. For a local validator or if your running a node or wanting to be a validator, the specs are likely identical recommendation for any on chain node, but dev is much less demanding based on overall TPS.  more info in <#560174212967432193>  <#837340113067049050>   local validator is generally a more recent machine with avx2 support and recommend 8gb + ram. But the more the better.
no
no eta, they are auto merged per the time outlined. not supported here however.
as a dev hosting a page? try to access it
as a user,  look under your browser plugins üôÇ
Hi! Is there a way to know if you have any wallet extension installed in your browser?
Hi, are the specs required for devnet the same as for mainnet? Or is a much lighter machine fine?
anyway to check smart contract code on solscan?
Okay sweet, when I look at comparable NFTs - my prices seem in line
Yeah, looks like those costs are just going to rent. Rent-exemption is ballpark $1/kb (just roughly), and yeah, you're allocating 1kb-ish
ty DonnySolana, trying to get anything through that channel is a pain lol
may have better luck about NFT minting optimization if there is any in Metaplex discord. Not sure if there are any off hand. https://discord.gg/z25cCask
I am using Metaplex's JS SDK, calling mintNFT(). I calculated it out, and it's over one dollar to mint. Are there any ways to lower the transaction fees?

Yep‚Äîthe regular solana explorer üòõ Click on the Mainnet Beta cluster button on the top right, and you can pick a different one, including your local validator
the getOrCreate would likely only throw that error if it cant validate the existing of one of the accounts involved in trying to create the token account address.  so would have nothing to do with a 'token' account balance, the from/payer funding account needs to have SOL in it to be able to fund the creation tho.
Hey guys. Is there such a thing as a** Solana Explorer** for `solana-test-validator` that can be installed on  `localhost` ?

 Like some types in the SDK use Serde to serialize-deserialize stuff, it conflicts with Anchor's borsh

I am not an expert in solana too, but from what I know I think a different user can also pay fee for transfer between other two party
--fee-payer seems redundant if I have --from
`solana transfer --from ~/wallet-1.json feKwSYhQu9JYmYXFqsqCXJ8f7zD9oyvuCPC3SHNWQyM 0.1                                          Error: Dynamic program error: No default signer found`
Can you show in which context you are talking about?
isn't the sender the feepayer by default?!
Why do I need to specify a --fee-payer on devnet?! The transaction is not going even if both wallets are funded
Put appropriate keypair path
solana address -k ~/.config/solana/id.json
can't find the command

Guys, what's the best way to find out the ping of the a private node from where you are
ya
so your saying the actual bin contents is identical?
thats cool and all but the program doesnt actually change
but that wont ever change right?  as that is just the reserved max data size based on your initial deploy. The space is reserved so it does not change or reflect your perceived 'actual' current size.  That may change in some future update in terms of what u might be able to reallocate and change this, but that is your reserved data size, afaik.

hello, i am trying to upgrade my program and it says upgrade is complete with a successful txn but the redeploy doesnt actually work
gotcha, sounds like I should stick to doing it in code.
based on scenario, here is code from cookbook:

the spl docs have related mint command:
https://spl.solana.com/token
any guides out there for setting up a mint on your localnet and executing a mintToInstruction from it via command line or is this something I should probably handle in code?
Can we write SOL smart contracts in TS or only with Rust?
For now even just a theoretical answer would be appreciated. Would it be easy to do the follow? Send X Sol to an address -> automatically the amount gets split and sent to multiple addresses that can vary during time (i.e. an expanding list of holders).
i got it to work by replacing all of the version numbers with stable, the following is another potential option (I haven't tried it)

a PDA is derived seed + program id. I have no idea how to derived a PDA base on a PDA.
the main feature of a PDA is that only a program can sign it. if you don't need this feature, you can consider a random account or create account with seed.
yes. a normal token account (except WSOL) can only be closed if its token balance is zero.
Maybe this library can help you (https://github.com/dao-xyz/borsh-ts) 

You can define you schema using decorators instead 

```
class SomeClass 
{
    @field({'u8'})
    x: number

    @field({'u64'})
    y: number

    @field({'String'})
    z: string

    @field({type: vec('u32')})
    q: number[]

    constructor(data?:SomeClass)
    {
        if(data)
        {
            Object.assign(this,data)
        }
    }
}

...

serialize(new SomeClass(...))
```

Disclaimer, I'm the author. I created this because I lost so much time using the vanilla borsh-js library because it is very easy to get the schema wrong.

try this
Can a PDA account be derived from another PDA account?
Okay so even if the user's ATA has the close authority as some 3rd party it still cant be closed if it has some positive balance in it.
1. a token account can only be closed when its token balance is zero (except WSOL)
2. a token account can only close by owner
3. when an ATA been created, its init owner is your wallet. you don't need to worry about there is someone can close it unless you give someone has authority to do it
please help
okay thank you for that
**hi, i cannot install solana on my pc, please help: **

Command's i use:

`C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe v1.10.8`

Error i Got: 
`The system cannot execute the specified program.`
the first signature of a tx will be the tx signature
can  a authority close the NFT Associated Token Account(even if there is some balance in the holder's ATA)? 
For eg there is a 3rd party who is creating the ATA for the user and minting the NFT to him.
But now the 3rd party wants to get back the ATA's rent SOL back for some reason and clear the balance as well.
Is this even possible?
only a correspond program can create the PDA account. also a PDA doesn't mean the correspond program must can modify its data.
if you have program A and a PDA P derived by it
A can modify P's data only if P's owner is A.
I'm not sure but I think the problem is not only about efficient but also you need to query to a node which have these data.
if so, could a malicious actor create a PDA account with an incorrect size for the data?
Oh, but the problem is, I can't get TransactionSignature
Is this true: anybody can create a PDA account, but only the program can modify its data?
I mean is there a more efficient way?
for jsonrpc, it is the only way to fetch transaction history
sure. I think you can use https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getTransaction
but you can only get a failed tx which on chain.
if your tx is block by preflight or it haven't been packed by block. you can't get it.
Is this the best way? https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getsignaturesforaddress
Is there an api to get all transactions of last week/month
Sorry for reasking the same question, but I still am stumped by it
ok I'll try that, thx
sry, I'm still a noob
Ah got you, I'm not sure sorry. I guess you could pass a `Message` with a single signature to `getFeeForMessage` maybe? Seems kinda roundabout though so hopefully somebody knows better than me!
I just need the lamportsPerSigniture value
idk, the `getFeeForMessage` function takes a message for input
I haven't used it, but I think https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getFeeForMessage (the deprecated `getFeeCalculatorForBlockhash` says to use this instead)
I saw that function, but `getLatestBlockhash` does not return a `feeCalculator`, what should I use instead?
`getLatestBlockhash`: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getLatestBlockhash

There's a note in the docs for `getRecentBlockhash` which says this: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getRecentBlockhash
So I just saw that the function `connection.getRecentBlockhash()` is deprecated, what should I use instead?
Is anyone aware of the most efficient way to fetch the instruction data from the Memo Program instruction of a transaction from the transaction signature
I believe its working for me now, thanks
Here's a look at my C# code, how I connect the blockhash
ty you for the advice man, where to plug the blockhash in `transfer` function
Good day! Can I somehow get signature of a failed transaction using ts?
you need to get the last Blockhash before each transaction sending request and pass it along with the transaction
really not sure cuz receive it from time to time, some transaction are processed successfully and other fails and i was wondering does anyone else have face similar issue
You need to create a blockhash first I believe
o i see it's related with retry on the transaction, any suggestion what number is using for `maxRetries` for transactions?
I'm receiving this error pretty often: `SendTransactionError: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found` any idea how to avoid it
i see
if they're fully custom, check their documentation or sourcecode (if available), or ask someone who works at that project
there's no general solution
yeah i've manage to resolve it üôÇ do you know how to debug custom program errors? üôÇ
do you mean associated token account? you need to create it if it doesn't exist yet, yeah. Most wallets do that automatically
and how we can check these `custom program error: 6021` errors
when we transfer fungible token from 1 token account to other token account, should we check first if token account exists?
spl-token cli install error , failed to run custom build command for `ring v0.16.20`
can you give me example of token in which tokennomics are manage on contract side
I still have this error, and I can't figure out how to fix it
solved thanks
or actually own a lot of token addresses which are reffered to by `mint address`?
so its correct to say my address owns token account, is that right? üôÇ
nope
<@585868308419444749> can you have a look why i am getting this error
sorry!
No, it's just your address.  Saying public is only going to confuse whoever you're talking to
and/or further data allocation and ownership assignment to a program
so this is my  address: `CGP6sKHyrZGPJRoUAy8XbyzmX7YD4tVBQG9SEe9ekZM6`: https://explorer.solana.com/address/CGP6sKHyrZGPJRoUAy8XbyzmX7YD4tVBQG9SEe9ekZM6/tokens?cluster=devnet and i can see some token holdings
whether there's an account there depends upon whether any SOL has been deposited there
what you have is an address, which may or may not actually point to an account on chain
you aren't
sec i dont know if i'm expressing my self correclty
the _public key_ which may or may not also be an _address_?
im reffering to the key pair that i'm using to search in solana explorer
"public account" is not a part of the solana lexicon.  so either you made it up or are misinformed
Guys is there any relation between public account and token account and if so how i can take from my public account the token account in order to check balance do transfers etc
no.  freeze means freeze. no changes can be made to the account other than that the freeze authority can unfreeze it
spl-token freeze 2gkmADDRESS
and will it decrease the total supply ?
It will remain inaccessible
hey guys what happens if we freeze any account of token

Hello all - I have been using metaplex & candy machine V2

I got this error when running the verify_upload command - "not all NFTs checked out" .

Not sure what could be the issue ü§î  perhaps a diff version of metaplex is the answer.

Has anyone received this error before ?
I wanna try to assist you but I don't understand your question man
So using latest will give you the latest it has instead of an error. Honestly I see this problem all the time in here. The docs should just tell people to do latest.

I don't wanna have to change code to switch between whats in production and what's able to run tests.
One of the biggest drivers of open source is RFCs, since Python and Bitcoin and all, so I'm curious to see how that happens in Solana
Yeah, but I mean, it's a standard created by a company, the Metaplex company. In the same way that the Token program is created by Solana Labs. That's what felt strange to me
> I mean, why can't I create my own token with some crazy custom logic?
This is a big security problem in EVM, think about what can a bad actor do to regular users by sending them tokens that have scamming logic inside of it when it's interacted with.

> Not having an ERC721 that can be extended, and having to rely on a third-party predefined program (e.g. from Metaplex) for NFTs also seemed weird. 
Metaplex is a standart just like ERC721 and you can extend it's functionality and even create your own program for it. It's just much convenient to use their version.
Hi everyone

I've just joined the community, it's nice to be part of this group! I've been learning Solana for less than a week (newbie here!!!), coming from Solidity.

I have some meta-questions that I have nobody to ask to, and I thought this might be a good place to start.

It's mostly related to the development ecosystem and open source approach to software development.

Coming from EVM, it was weird to me to find out that most programs are built by the Solana team. SPL seems both a life saver (because I don't have use openzeppelin to deploy an ERC20 with many different properties, for example) and a bit of a blocker to innovation (I mean, why can't I create my own token with some crazy custom logic?). Not having an ERC721 that can be extended, and having to rely on a third-party predefined program (e.g. from Metaplex) for NFTs also seemed weird. The lack of "EIPs" really shocked me. 

Does this reasoning make sense? Does anyone feel the same?
Network is localhost

ok got it
ok I ran "solana --version" its like froxen
it should show 1.9.15 i think
That's why I posted it after yours.
then solana --version will work
he will have to close adn re open cmd to update the PATH
solana --version
close and re open cmd

is there a 100% deterministic way of figuring out what program a txn interacted with? im looking at the last log msgs rn but that feels finnicky
Depends on if you want to sign for one of your program's program-derived addresses (in which case you can only do that with invoke_signed)
anyone know `spl_token_swap::instruction::swap` CPI should use `invoke` or `invoke_signed`?

HI there.
I'm trying to deploy a program to the `testnet` . I execute `solana program deploy` and it hangs on for several minutes then exits with an error `Error: Custom: Invalid blockhash` likely after a timeout.
The programs deploy just fine to a local `solana-test-validator`. I'm not sure what's wrong with it. Please help what should I do to get more details about the error. Thanks in advance.
whats up with solana explorer no longer searching most of the spl tokens?
ignore above question, found solution from chat history
Im try to integrate with token swap but getting error 

error: the #[global_allocator] in this crate conflicts with global allocator in: spl_token_swap

anyone know how to resolve it?

Hi guys are there any good guides on how to create instructions to send a custom SPL token using JavaScript from one wallet to another?
I had this issue, only way I could get it to work was to use WSL 2.
Conceptually speaking, deflationary tokens simply reduce their supply over time right? You could easily do that by having tokens burned afaik. Samoyedcoin would be an example.
I think solana's SOL will always be slightly inflationary (1.8% long term)
is it possible to use the chrono-crate in the implementation of solana smart contracts?
Hello. I try to get all transactions for a NFT. My code is the following with js.
```
const connection = new Connection("https://ssc-dao.genesysgo.net/")
const signatures = await connection.getSignaturesForAddress(<mint address>)
const transactions = await connection.getParsedTransactions(signatures.map((signature) => signature.signature))
```
However, I can get only latest transaction. Does getParsedTransactions contain a bug? Does anyone know the cause of this?
I understand that the problem is due to ``\\?\`` in the beginning of the path, but dk how to change it
Hi, I'm using anchor, and the tests fail due to an error in path for ``cargo-build-bpf child``
The error given is: 
``Failed to obtain package metadata: `cargo metadata` exited with an error: error: failed to load manifest for workspace member `` ``\\`\C:\Users\%USER%\&PROGRAM%\programs\*``

``Caused by:``
 ``failed to read `\\?\C:\Users\%USER%\&PROGRAM%\programs\*\Cargo.toml``
or is there nothing? and just rely on the contract interactions
Is there a standard where you can differentiate between a fungible and a nonfungible transaction easily? Anything that would occur in a NFT tx that wouldnt in a fungible? I thought the slp program was only called with nfts but I see a tx with some fungible tokens as well
The reason I ask is because I‚Äôve read in many forums that sol is a deflationary coin. Some developers have told me that solana does not support the creation of deflationary tokens. Is this true?
Hey has anyone here created a solana token?
Definitely will!
That is easy enough to test using `solana-test-validator` locally or in devnet. Standup an account with rent exemption, drain it, then run the transfer test. I had not tested that particular case in my dealings.... perhaps others here have and can give a quicker answer than just trying it yourself.
Thanks for reply
Perfect, thanks.  Yeah I'm handling the System vs. Program owned buyer case and the program is doing the token transfer through token authority delegation.  Last question - if the seller were to drain his system/wallet account of SOL and it gets garbage collected from not meeting rent exemption, the buyer can still send SOL to the seller address without having to pay rent for the seller, right?
A program can debit a program owned account and credit ANY account. I know of nothing where an account can be 'blocked' from receiving SOL/lamports. If the account you want to debit is NOT a program owned account, then the program can invoke a 'system transfer' to perform the transfer. This is just comments on the movement of SOL/lamports, not the actual transfer of the Token (but I assume the program would make that transfer of the token from the seller to the buyer)
https://solanacookbook.com/references/programs.html#how-to-transfer-sol-in-a-program
https://solanacookbook.com/references/basic-transactions.html#how-to-send-sol
Thanks for the reply.  So there's no way for the seller to create or configure his account or create a program owned account that could block receiving sol to that address?
It is safe if the program that handles the sale sends the proceeds to the account owned by the seller. Of course the buyer and seller accounts would need to be sent in with the transaction so the program knows where to debit/credit the SOL.
<@751627776574095473> yeah, I'm searching for a method that wasn't destroyed, or a blockchain with a functioning development cycle.
hey, im using `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`. is there a way to mock certain wallet addresses for testing?
Security question - Is it safe to "push" payments in Solana contracts?  For example, if there's an auction contract that's selling a token and someone buys the token, is it okay to send SOL directly to the seller's address in the same transaction as the purchase?  In the ETH world, this is a no-no because the receiving contract can run arbitrary code when that happens.  They instead, recommend that the auction contract store the balance owed to the seller and require the seller to do a separate transaction to withdraw the funds they are owed.
Yeah I think so? Maybe a performance related section at some point? I know there was this comment in core techology at one point that benchmarked the compute of a bunch of different mathematical functions and some people were pretty interested in that. Maybe that could be rebenchmarked every once in a while (?). I'll see if I can find that comment in core tech. Or it could go in some performance section of the forum that people might start working on
I think the best solution is to run the sdk on your server and have only a limited set of instructions in the frontend
Yes. But this is just a performance improvement?
<@489206164270350337> sorry for the ping but youll have this in your newsletter? It's Haoran Yi's log2 ceiling one -- seems cool? https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/24301
Solana programs are a compiled byte code called "BPF" and there is no way to get to the original Rust or C/C++ vis-a-vis a disassembler (yet?). You will need to look at source code if the processing program is open source or, if not, talk with the authors of the program.
The Solana CLI manages our SPL Token.
Solana CLI is BIP32, which wallet is best to use Solana CLI wallet from GUI?
We created our token using Solana Paper Wallet aka BIP32, which Solana wallet support the import of the same using either seed phrase or private key, we tried with Solflare and it didn't work
No, the program can log stuff and the rpc just prints it for you
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/Cargo.toml
seems like the sdk is using wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
not sure if they have full support yet.
Hi solana dev guys, I have a question about Tx request.
I made a Tx request with sendTransaction function of solana web3.js . And I got such response. The question is how the rpc receiver could know code lines in rust program file that caused error(The 3rd program log). Can solana rpc receiver node track solana program codes in the repository?
Cannot find anything on Solscan
Any answer?
im coming from python where that doesnt exist

I recommend reading up what promises are, you'll need the concept in javascript a lot
thanks
you gotta await the promise. if you're in an async function do `await`, if not, do `getBalance().then((result) => { console.log(result) })`
but im getting Promise {<pending>}
I'm trying to fetch the balance
Newbie here
I want to create this in Solana
1. Enable gateway that people can send BTC and get our BTCu token. Then I want to stake the BTC that people send. So this is one contract, basic crosschain gateway and automated staking
2. The second contract is swapping between our token family (the one with "u" as an ending like BTCu, ETHu) 

Anyone ever done this? Where do I start and find the reference?

Hi, where can I get docs for "@solana/spl-token": "^0.1.8"? 

The current docs present at https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/token/js/modules.html is probably for "@solana/spl-token": "^0.2.0". I need old docs because when I include @metaplex/js in my code, then it changes my included spl-token version from v0.2.0 to v0.1.8.
Can someone help me with this please?

Hi
when you create an account for storing something, you need to give it a max size. 
so your growable list won't be an infinite list.
if someday your list size is greater than the max size, you will need to migrate it to a large account or create another account to store.
What is the best way to store a growable list in an account?

wow. i'm not getting those iq points back
kk
so we want data from here correct
https://solscan.io/account/EvnRmnMrd69kFdbLMxWkTn1icZ7DCceRhvmb2SJXqDo4 this is everstake
moves so fast lol
So lets say we do chainnode
IK
and you can fetch it from just one node
which is broadcasted by different nodes
you need to source from the raw block data
if you want to listen to blocks
Bro
Bruhg
node doesnt matter -_-
So which node are you wanting to focus on
no need for fetching all nodes
from one node
so you can do it RAW
you can just fetch all txs
lemme get you the api source
BRUH
https://solscan.io/blocks
try sourcing from here
there are thousands of nodes
Thats gonna be hard
from node directly
You have to get your data from somewhere
lets try with async functions
nothing is different
build something similar
and if you want
look at the code
the code
https://public-api.solscan.io/docs/#/Block/get_block__block_
check this out
yes
and you want a live feed im assuming
yes
so the whole network?
mainnet
on solana
or a specific node
deposits on the whole networks
hm
Is it possible for me to "not log" logs even in files or console..?
a polling system(tx listener) for listening deposits
<@443825206260400130>
so what are you trying to do
kk
ok wait 20 mins ill get back to u
if its my node, its trustless
bruh wtf
deal with it
every blockchain is centralized
it direnctly monitoring the blockchain
any solana devs out there I would like to get on a project

thanks for the help bud ultimately your suggestion to update version of spl-token took me down the right path, cheers!
installed spl-token lib as a dep then updated some type issues and voila - gone
but its centralised and abusable

try these
lemme think
hm
JS(NodeJS)
what program are you using?
Any ideas?
It falls behind network
my software is slower than solana
Im trying to listen blocks(and inner txs) but i cant keep up
Hey Veritas

nope
Did you get that resolved?
If that doesn't work try downgrading the version of the spl-token package (if thats the one ur using). I still use 0.1.8 I think
Tried that and it didn't work.  I've seen some peeps try using yarn rather than npm for install - trying that now

I think the solution is mentioned in the issue as an update. If u run `npm install -D @solana/buffer-layout` it should work?
Yeah I've seen that aswell, I think there is also more guides and documentation for js
I use js because there are a lot of other tools that u can interop with written in js as node modules (`@solana/web3.js` etc.). Im not sure the same support exists for python, but I haven't looked into it much
I know that smart contracts only work with rust

hey
Its the same stuff that metaboss does, but in typescript
The metadata accounts of candy machine NFTs store a 'creator' account that's a PDA derived from the string 'candy_machine' and the candy machine's public key. You look for that creator account in the metadata using `getProgramAccounts` and it returns an array of all the NFT metadata accounts. From there, you can iterate through the metadata accounts to get the mint account
I'm able to do it like this in my client.

```typescript
 //first, find all NFT metadata accounts and mints created from this candy machine.
  let [creatorAccount, creatorBump] = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
    [Buffer.from("candy_machine"), candyMachine.toBuffer()],
    METAPLEX_CANDY_MACHINE_PROGRAM,
  );
  //look for the creator account 326 bytes into the metadata account's data
  //this code was helpful: https://github.com/oleksiikovalenko/Solana-metaboss/blob/f1eb87448ca987f4d4b841db360e55ae612d2d14/src/snapshot.rs#L404
  //this operation will take a minute
  let filter: MemcmpFilter = {
    memcmp:{
      bytes: creatorAccount.toString(),
      offset: CREATOR_BYTE_START_INDEX //326,
    }
  }
  let config: GetProgramAccountsConfig = {
    commitment: "confirmed",
    dataSlice: undefined,
    encoding: "base64",
    filters: [filter]
  }
  console.log(`searching for NFTs minted from candy machine ${candyMachine.toString()}`)
  let metadataInfoArr = await connection.getProgramAccounts(METAPLEX_METADATA_PROGRAM, config);
  metadataInfoArr.forEach((obj) => {
    let metadataAccount = obj.pubkey;
    let metadata = obj.account.data;
    let mintAccount = new PublicKey(metadata.slice(33, 33 + 32));
    nftAccounts[mintAccount.toString()] = metadataAccount;
  })
```
Can a token mint account be a PDA? Or does it need to be a normal keypair? I want to create a mint address that I'm able to rederive later
for some reason, there might be something wrong with my file architecture. What are you thoughts?
hey guys, I tried to test simple anchor implementation of twitter and I found an error when running anchor test
what's the recommended blockchain to use that works?
yikes
I guess not
Any update on this?
```impl AnchorSerialize for ElGamalPubkey{
    fn serialize<W: std::io::Write>(&self, writer: &mut W) -> std::io::Result<()>{

        self.0.to_bytes(&mut buf[..]);
        writer.write_all(&buf)
    }
}```     is this something that i can do?
how do i do that ?ü•≤
You would need to impl the borsh part, using their serde implementation (annoying, but that's what you'd have to do in order to stick it in an anchor #[account])
https://docs.rs/solana-zk-token-sdk/1.10.8/solana_zk_token_sdk/encryption/elgamal/struct.ElGamalPubkey.html#impl-Serialize
so do i use Borsh or Serde? from what i see here they're using serde
Is there a standard where you can differentiate between a fungible and a nonfungible transaction easily? Anything that would occur in a NFT tx that wouldnt in a fungible?
Ok, yeah, unless solana itself derives BorshSerialize for that type, you'd have to do something kind of annoying like make your own wrapper type and then *impl* BorshSerialize for it yourself (not derive, unfortunately) by using their existing serde serialization/deserialization stuff
getting this error here that's why i was deriving it, idk if im doing it the correct way <@134416332509675520>
So I was just playing with the SDK,  I had an account state store an Elgamal publickey
Hello, is it normal that Sollet do not fund recipient address upon sending "custom" SPL-Token ? 
`spl-token transfer --fund-recipient xxxxx`
work but send it from Sollet to the same wallet was failing (and now work has the account has been created I guess)
Thanks
Why do you want to derive that on that type?
Wait so there's this ElGamalPubkey type in the zk SDK, if I derive AnchorSerialize and deserialize on it, it breaks
Oh
That won't be a problem (anchor doesn't only use borsh)
Is there a standard where you can differentiate between a fungible and a nonfungible transaction easily? Anything that would occur in a NFT tx that wouldnt in a fungible?

nice, I a going to try using the underlaying functions
There's a somewhat unfortunate catch in there that discards any error that might happen when you actually go and create the account

I'm running @solana/web3.js, do you guys know how I should handle the devnet restart ? I didn't use the CLI at all
I'm not sure, but you can definitely just start paying an address, from scratch
so then what am I missing with the ATA?
No, it can receive right away
I want to create a custom token transfer on an account that doesn't not going to have SOL at all, just the custom token. What I was doing is create the pair then use getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount to pay for the account (of ATA) but for some reason is giving me TokenAccountNotFoundError
Hi guys, I a just confused. When I create a keypair, that public address is not able (yet) to receive transfers right? because it needs an account with a rent right?
ty
You can see an example of how to do this here: https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/tree/master/client/example
As many as you want
in that case taking a nap
i guess devnet not working cuz of restart? cant deploy rn

Any help is much appriciated
hm... can I try to delpoy to testnet or it does not work that way?
its like `{ accounts: []: programId: "", data: "base58_ix_data" } `
but by hand would require you to format the first 8 bytes of the sha256 for the instruction name, then appending the binary base58 encoded instruction data
last night, `let result = await window.solana.signAndSendTransaction(transaction)` would return on success the TX.
Right now, seems it's returning the Signature... this is because DEVNET is kinda fucked up right now or something change on the wallets and such?
you can use `anchor-ts` for direct bindings to the CM IDL - not sure with `anchor-py` but `anchor-go` will generate an go sdk from IDL so you can use with `solana-go`
I would assume hours, have to restart a couple of clusters. i guess some people need to wake up first haha

if you want token metadata as JSON returned to stdout, then https://github.com/Triptych-Labs/metaplex_decoder
wait so what is the command for it
the announcement said "morning", but what's the timezone lol
wen devnet restart?
check <#749579745645166592>
solana cli can only return a byte array, if you want to get a readable data format, maybe you can try https://github.com/samuelvanderwaal/metaboss
maybe https://docs.metaplex.com/ and https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library
how long does such a restart usually take?
explorer shows no data for devnet so maybe they are commencing the restart? program deploys still fail tho
devnet working?
Is there like a way to get a token's metadata through the solana cli
i hear debnet comin bak on lezz gooooooo

Hello all.

I am learning solana and I think I am done with basics of it after doing couple of projects like crodfund, escorw etc.

Now I want to learn about NFT. Where shall I start. Anybody can share some roadmap or resource.

Or if anyone in same road, let's connect
Is devnet up again? I am still having issues
thanks for the info
finally i can chug some energy drinks and make up for 6 lost hours
I'm having trouble as well, they made an announcement about some kind of reset happening this morning in the devnet announcements channel
Solana devnet is working or not?
What happened?
I am not sure if it is down or not. :/
is the status.solana reliable?
that actually sounds like a good idea. We can start a blockchain development guild for rust
should we start one?
there is a rust community but they are not focused on blockchain at all
is there any voice chat group for development on Solana? I am going now through the anchor docs and being part of a voice chat would help tbh
vim gang
neovim + dev plugins works exceptionally well for any development. I don't need to switch to anything else
Yea can be frustrating ^^
i spent too much time managing remote servers in a past life to fiddle with graphical editors. `vscode + scp` became too intrusive when you could just use vim lol
Eclipse sucks big time
Also VsCode is great, had to use Eclipse for Java in University
I actually like a graphic IDE
(neo)vim with conquer of completion is a less bloated vscode for your terminal, if you prefer no GUIs
Same^^
super junior Rust dev trying to learn
i got the extensions
tysm
Alright^^
word i started coding on mac so that is somehwat familiar
It will then automatically open the folder in VsCode from the ubuntu interface
the . at the end is mandatory to open vscode
any type in code .
plssssssss
then switch to your directory in the Linux shell
rust-analyzer > rls
Those are the extensions I'm using
and (not required) Better TOML
rust-analyzer
CodeLLDB
Alright, then you need to install the Remote - WSL extension
ive got that
Afterwards install VsCode on windows
Rust doesn't include a linker atm, thats why you have to use a C compiler
sudo apt install build-essential
Hey I set up wsl and am not retrying build. diff error. any ideas?
pls u have to get devnet back up soon sers

aaaaaaaaa wen devnet
seems like feature activation on latest block - 297 has degraded devnet
Has there been any announcement with respect to devnet
When is devnet gonna be up like ...
Thanks!
Thats a short summary of how it works
https://medium.com/@josh.wolff.7/derivation-paths-on-solana-fb08d3dd09f1
I will have to learn about that what you mentioned, that one pub key can be seed for multiple others
You're welcome, glad I could help!
I see, now pubkey is the same as the one printed right after wallet creation, thanks!
pretty straightforward command and just prints out your pubkey
solana address
Let's say I want to know my pubkey for this wallet, what command do you suggest?
Okay I just created a new wallet, stored it in a file and set active keypair to that file
Also regarding your last question, the private key is **never ** shown in the cli tool, this one is stored in the outfile. In this case its new.json
solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/new.json
Then set it as your active keypair
like so: 
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/new.json
So use an outfile when creating a new wallet
if you fail to use the proper keypair when deploying a program, you will get a wrong owner error
But every new key derived from that seed could be anywhere, for example m/44'/501'/2'/50
The wallet at your seed is m/44'/501'/0'/0
pretty sure the `pubkey` method is how program ids are derived also.
Keep in mind, that the pubkey isn't necessarily paired with the wallet at your seed
Ah I see, now I know what the problem is you're facing
So when new wallet is created with:
solana-keygen new --no-outfile
Then one pubkey is printed, for example pubkey1 (along side seed phrase)
Then I want to get my pubkey with command:
solana-keygen pubkey 
Then program asks me for seed phrase, and after insertion of seed phrase a different pubkey is printed, for example pubkey2. So which of those two pubkeys is public and which is private?
But basically its 1 pubkey paired with 1 private key
Kinda, yea. But theres actually one keypair that acts as a seed from which you can derive multiple other keypairs
I mean I don't have any problem with my wallet(s), airdroping and transfers work, but I'm just currious about the two different pubkeys generated for the same wallet. I would expect one wallet to have one pubkey, right?
replacing the "new.json" with the filename you chose
and then run 
solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/new.json
You'd have to convert the private key to the right format beforehand tho
Hm that would've been my guesses. You could try import the private key to a new .json file and set your keypair to that path
Yes, I set that (using paper wallet)
thank you, but is there any info about when its up again ?
Its down atm
hello, anyone know when is the devnet up ?
replace the id.json with the path to the correct keypair
solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/id.json
Did you set the right keypair as active?
ty for the affirm
Devnet is down atm
anyone else having trouble deploying on devnet?
Solana address returns the same hash as solana-keygen pubkey , and those values are different than the pubkey: <hash>, which is printed right after wallet creation
Seems like everything worked, restart the shell (close the window) and type in rustc --version
on a enter key. every time when i tap enter rust crashed and then i need to open it again and again
This will return your active keypairs pubkey
The command for getting your pubkey is solana address
One question as I'm new to this: when I create a wallet, one of the things printed is: 
pubkey: <hash_here>
But when I run command for getting public key (solana-keygen pubkey), and I enter seed words that I also got during the creation of the wallet, a different hash is printed. Is it the case that one wallet has two addresses.
So where exactly are you stuck?
: (
it doesnt help
Just close and reopen it
Restart the shell
Was about to redeploy some Cms but didn't manage to do so, now I know why
i want to create a solana token but idk what to do with it
Was looking for that info, thank you^^
a stupid question but what i need to do next? i tried enter and rust crashed
Thank you
Thanks!
devnet is down atm
Linux environments work way better, as most of the tools you have to use aren't compatible with windows
I'd recommend to rebuild your dev environment in wsl
Okay, I was guessing that
Windows
Which OS are you using?

trying to build anchor... getting this error at the end every time
Hello, I'm unable to airdrop in devnet at the moment, is there any issue with the cluster?
I need some devs for my future project on Solana
Using cli 1.8.0 worked for me
Hey, did you manage to deploy?
Why is this necessary? What is the main change you are adding to the default script?
Solana mainnet and testnet both throwing `Invalid blockhash` on solana program deploy ü§î
Regex for checking length?
Lol y would write a regex for a signature lol
hey. what is the solanas signature length, i am writing a regex for it.
ü•≤
Devent is down ye
is devnet down for anyone?
and am running airdrop command next
I used solana-keygen to generate keypair, then set the config to devnet url, and the keypair to filepath of previously genereated keypair
Hi, I have been trying to run the following command
solana airdrop 1 <RECIPIENT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> --url https://api.devnet.solana.com/
to airdrop SOL from devnet to my wallet
but the following error shows up
Error: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds
can somebody help me with this please?
Ye devnet is do e
`Invalid blockhash` everytime...
<@296903467237113858> use `AnchorProvider` instead of `Provider`
```ts
const provider = new anchor.AnchorProvider(connection, signerWallet, {
      commitment: "processed",
});
```
anyone have any idea to solve this?
Do you know if testnet is working ok for deploying contracts?
same for me, not even airdrops ü§î
hmm seems like devnet is broken again smh
nothing is working .. umm
is devnet broken ??
and its still giving me this error like
i have the recent blockhash
Hi, what are some reason that I'm getting this error ? ```Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found 
```
Whats the canonical way to increase the size of a program account buffer?
2 days our mainnet contract program works just fine but recently we cannot send any transactions to it anymore, any suggestion?
thank you. After thinking for a while, it does sound kinda scammy. if you are able do it. haha
yes
AFAIK you can't do it.
If I sign a transaction, serialize it, and then send the raw signature multiple times, only 1 of it will successfully send right
hi, are you able to change the decimal values of a token later ?
How do people typically manage historical views of data on chain?
hihi
makes sense with the huge amount of load those calls caused
NFT related calls aren't just limited but completely disabled on the main RPCs
i would just try in intervals and ask again, or possibly email them or try other RPCs as well, until you get the answers or results your looking for.
id ask the anchor discord. but in general, anchor has its own libs and items compiled for functionality to run, right, so its possible the extra overhead is from an anchor related resource needed to compile and run the code based on anchor.  if I referenced another crate program or library included, it would likely increase the size as well.
Thanks. I suspect they are throttling my request. I already asked a while ago on their server and no one has responded yet.
different RPCs have different limitations.  lots of NFT related calls have been abused so may be limited on certain RPCs. 410 and 403 are generally results of the end point and not on your end. in this case they may have been limited or removed for certain reasons. in some cases the call you may be referencing is no longer supported, outdated, or from a previous version that has been deprecated. for genesys go a definitive answer and alternative can probably be found in their discord. 
https://discord.gg/M3UzsfZy
Not yet.
I did. I get different errors for different rpc addresses. The solana beta rpc gives me this error: Error: HTTP status client error (410 Gone) for url (`https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/`) which is strange because the website seems to be up and working
Maybe try asking on the GenesysGo channel.
Did you find an answer to this question?
I'm using the genesysgo rpc for metaboss, but it's giving me a 403 forbidden. Does anyone know why? (Here's the command: `metaboss --rpc https://ssc-dao.genesysgo.net/ snapshot mints --creator C2DhZrAbThBfjuBSnyR59HeFPbAKqFMJKx1ZdVegbUYs --v2`)
Any clue as to why?  Just started getting it recently too.  Checked solana's networks stats and everything seems good to go
When hitting `https://api.testnet.solana.com` I'm getting this error? Error: 410 Gone:  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code": 410, "message":"The RPC call or parameters have been disabled."}, "id": "a20371f1-502e-4086-975d-baf213b93575" }

How do I verify the signer from a message I got from phantom?

example: `{'signature': {'type': 'Buffer', 'data': [178, 238, 192, 27, 90, 209, 50, 185, 69, 124, 159, 176, 136, 79, 114, 97, 146, 197, 215, 22, 142, 80, 153, 90, 137, 251, 70, 102, 144, 67, 138, 220, 211, 76, 42, 42, 201, 123, 41, 35, 234, 241, 31, 60, 211, 225, 167, 43, 203, 80, 199, 136, 82, 79, 85, 134, 24, 148, 39, 161, 46, 133, 4, 8]}, 'publicKey': 'HDcdQVyvghNaP8v5XoauQnLKCg4p7p16NbKHGXCZrNBD'}`
Just FYI
This might be effecting searching for Tokens on Solana Explorer
`wget https://token-list.solana.com/solana.tokenlist.json

Hi
And Phantom Wallet docs say that `signTransaction` is deprecated
So, after trying more stuff to understand why is not working, now I have this:
```js
// WORKS
const result = await window.solana.signTransaction(recoveredTransaction)
const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(result.serialize());
// DOESN'T WORK
const result = await window.solana.signAndSendTransaction(recoveredTransaction)
```
ü§Ø
i can't believe that worked
insane
you are
Let me try and I'll update over here
I actually didn't was using solana-sdk and runtime wouldn't compule for some reason
x) you everywhere cqfdee x)
I haven't tried that
Hm really
That makes me think you're using an out of date rust maybe?
try using directly assert instead of storing it in a const
deploy success üòÑ
How do I verify signers of a signed message?
u r trying to put an assert into a const ?
we just have to wait x)
it's just service unavailable
Here
Btw would you know anything about this error I'm coming across
maybe ^^
Maybe rate limited?
hey i'm getting error 503 is the devnet down ?
Nope. Still getting an error.
Hi, did you solve this? I am as well trying to create a transaction to interact with MagicEden
Anyone know how to resolve this

I'm trying to follow this section of the solanacookbook: https://solanacookbook.com/references/offline-transactions.html#partial-sign-transaction
Hi everyone, hope someone can lead me in the right direction here is my issue:

I have this code on the server side: https://pastebin.com/K9WmK8QM
On the client side, I receive the transaction encoded in base64 and create a transaction with it.
Then I try to sign it with the Phantom wallet with this code: https://pastebin.com/4CfRQmVb
But it keeps saying `Phantom - RPC Error: Transaction creation failed. {code: -32003, message: 'Transaction creation failed.'}`
When the Phantom popup shows up, the info is correct!

What I'm trying to achiev is partially sign a transaction serverside to not expose the private key of the "bank" wallet, send it to the client side and ask for the client to validate the transaction, paying the fees.

Ty in advance
How does the db get populated?  It needs to be hooked up to a validator node correct?  In order for data to be read from the validator node and then written to the accounts-db right?
hi so i am trying to get the nft #1 from a collection using the candy machine id. I cannot seem to find this anywhere. Would rather not use getProgramAccount becuase it is very slow
Hi everyone. I try to interact with a third party solana program (in this Case MagicEden V1 - i want to list my NFT) via RPC instead of the Webinterface (which uses MEv2). But I'm not able to get i running correct. I think the mistake is, that I'm not adding the right value for the new Account in the transaction. I have created a stackoverflow question for this.

Hey guys, is developing an off-chain Rust client similar to developing on-chain but using solana-sdk instead of solana-program?
Hey. Does anybody know why Anchor built .so files take up almost 5 times the space. If I make a vanilla Solana .so file - it is about 50kb, and if I compile an anchor program that does the same thing - it takes up 234kb. Is it normal, or did I do something wrong that it took up so much space?
What do you guys think about Anchor? Do you prefer to use a framework or just run low level contracts?
Need a developer, I am available

https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/ts/classes/AnchorProvider.html#sendAndConfirm
i dont see a `sendTransaction` method for `AnchorProvider.connection`
naw this is probably an `provider.connection` issue
Yeah I get it with `Keypair.generate()`

Now that I think about it, maybe the problem is that Keypair !== Signer?
is truthy?
and `whitelistMint` is `!undefined`?
Yeah, I get the wallet popup to sign the transaction in the browser
`userWallet.signTransaction` forces the wallet provider to emit an authorization modal so you can approve the tx?
I'd think`sendTransaction` would take care of that though
Anchor Events
does solana have any "subscriber" feature where some contract can get automatically trigerred once some onchain variable updates?
The tx has two entries in the signatures property after I call `userWallet.signTransaction)` but the one for `whitelistMint` doesn't have a signature...
but the code looks right to me
`Unhandled Runtime Error: !signature. ` theres no `!signature` anywhere
I'm getting `Unhandled Runtime Error: !signature`. 

Here's my code, not sure what I'm doing wrong.

```typescript
import * as anchor from '@project-serum/anchor';
export async function initializeVault(
  connection: Connection,
  candyMachine: PublicKey,
  userWallet: anchor.Wallet, //passed in from useAnchorWallet() react hook
): Promise<String> {

  let programAddress = idl.metadata.address; //imported from json
  let provider = new anchor.Provider(connection, userWallet, {});
  let anchorProgram = new anchor.Program(idl, programAddress, provider)
  let [vaultAccount, vaultBump] = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
    [candyMachine.toBuffer()],
    programAddress,
  );

  let vaultTokenAccount = await getAssociatedTokenAddress(
    USDH_MINT,
    vaultAccount,
    true,
    TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
    ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  )

  let whitelistMint = Keypair.generate(); 
  let [whitelistAuth, whitelistAuthBump] = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
    [whitelistMint.publicKey.toBuffer()],
    programAddress,
  );

  let tx = new Transaction();
  tx.add(anchorProgram.instruction.initializeVault(
    vaultBump, 
    whitelistAuthBump,
    candyMachine,
    {
      accounts: {
        admin: provider.wallet.publicKey,
        systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
        vault: vaultAccount,
        tokenVault: vaultTokenAccount,
        mint: USDH_MINT,
        tokenProgram: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
        associatedTokenProgram: ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
        rent: SYSVAR_RENT_PUBKEY,
        whitelistMint: whitelistMint.publicKey,

      },
    }
  ))
  tx.recentBlockhash = (await provider.connection.getLatestBlockhash()).blockhash;
  tx.feePayer = provider.wallet.publicKey;
  tx = await userWallet.signTransaction(tx);
  console.log(tx)
  let sig = await provider.connection.sendTransaction(tx, [whitelistMint]);

  return sig
}

Hi
It seems like even with ConnectionProvider, WalletProvider and WalletModalProvider, when I use WalletMultiButton and WalletDisconnectButton, it doesn't find the appropriate WalletContext
Hello everyone, i'm trying to install anchor on windows with the client command :cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.24.2 anchor-cli --locked, the installation seems to be finished correctely, but when i try to run anchor init command i have this error : 
Only x86_64 / Linux distributed in NPM package right now.
Trying globally installed anchor.
Could not find globally installed anchor, install with cargo.
specify the location but the full path instead of `./keypair.json`
your keypair path is not `/Users/whymidnight/...` lol
Hey, got some issues with spl-token when I add @.metaplex/js to my project, any idea ?
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#sendTransaction
what does it mean?: (
new error lol
you would use `anchorWallet.signTransaction` for a signed tx using anchor, then `connection.sendTransaction(tx, [new Keypair])`
thanks for your answers!
just tried with a basic example from anchor github, idl is there, so probably something wrong with my program
Yeah it's not working better, I still get the same errors. Thank you for your time thought, really appreciate it!
`AnchorWallet` objects don't have a `sendTransaction` method though, that's the problem
```
          let buyTx = Transaction.populate(
            new Message(buyIx.transaction.message),
          );
          buyTx.recentBlockhash = (
            await connection.getRecentBlockhash('finalized')
          ).blockhash;
          const signature = await wallet.sendTransaction(buyTx, connection, {
            signers: [Keypair.fromSecretKey(base58_to_binary(buyIx.mintKey))],
          });
          await connection.confirmTransaction(signature, 'processed');
```
Ah, thanks ! Is it because I've used WalletModalProvider instead of WalletDialogProvider?
that makes sense. What if my transaction requires multiple signatures though? Like, I'm creating an account via a keypair I generate, how do I sign the transaction with that keypair as well as the react wallet?
your wallet context tree should look something like this 
```
    ¬¶ <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>    
    ¬¶ ¬¶ <WalletProvider wallets={wallets} onError={onError} autoConnect>    
    ¬¶ ¬¶ ¬¶ <WalletDialogProvider>{children}</WalletDialogProvider>    
    ¬¶ ¬¶ </WalletProvider>                                        
    ¬¶ </ConnectionProvider>  
```
Maybe this is a less dumb of a question:

understandable.. sometimes it really hollows you out
should be 
```

//add instructions from anchor program, set fee payer and blockhash on the tx

tx = anchorWallet.signTransaction(tx);
let sig = await anchorProvider.connection.sendRawTransaction(tx.serialize());
```
for whatever stupid javascript reason
Thanks!
Yeah someone answered i'm just dumb xD When you're lost in code for the past 6 hours you tend to ask really idiot questions
it's an eth wallet mate
`anchor build` is the only command that will generate an idl so `cargo clean && anchor build`
Hi guys, does the code for this demo https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/example/ exists? Thanks! ^^
Does anyone know how to send transactions with the `AnchorWallet` object returned by the  `useAnchorWallet` hook? There's methods for `signTransaction` on the `AnchorWallet` object, so I thought I could do something like this.

```
tx = new Transaction();

//add instructions from anchor program, set fee payer and blockhash on the tx

let signedTx = anchorWallet.signTransaction(tx);
let sig = await anchorProvider.connection.sendRawTransaction(signedTx.serialize());
```
but I get a `signature verification failed` error. How can I sign a transaction to an anchor program with a react wallet?
``cargo clean`` and then ``cargo build-bpf`` ?
`cargo clean`?
no errors
``` `rustc --crate-name alpha --edition=2021 programs/alpha/src/lib.rs --error-format=json --json=diagnostic-rendered-ansi --crate-type cdylib --crate-type lib --emit=dep-info,link -C opt-level=3 -C embed-bitcode=no --cfg 'feature="default"' -C metadata=b38a04b3d7753494 --out-dir /mnt/c/users/twentyone/alpha/target/bpfel-unknown-unknown/release/deps --target bpfel-unknown-unknown -L dependency=/mnt/c/users/twentyone/alpha/target/bpfel-unknown-unknown/release/deps -L dependency=/mnt/c/users/twentyone/alpha/target/release/deps --extern anchor_lang=/mnt/c/users/twentyone/alpha/target/bpfel-unknown-unknown/release/deps/libanchor_lang-7746059e0bd89a50.rlib --extern num_derive=/mnt/c/users/twentyone/alpha/target/release/deps/libnum_derive-e99fa9779fa71b35.so --extern num_traits=/mnt/c/users/twentyone/alpha/target/bpfel-unknown-unknown/release/deps/libnum_traits-7671ba1c5bade6c2.rlib` ```
the compiler reports success?
`cargo build-bpf --verbose --verbose`?
nope, just tried that, still no idl
just had a successful program deploy on `api.devnet.solana.com`
is devnet still experiencing performance issues?
aside from deps, heres my cargo 
```

no
do you have

``overflow-checks = true``
in your root package?
to prevent anchor from allocating stack automatically
if it is stack related, than just wrap your `account` in a `Box<>` like so `pub account_foo: Box<Account<'info, TokenAccount>>`
heres an example that would prevent anchor from generating that idl

hm now that i've tried compiling an empty program it did create an idl file, yeah i think it has something to do with stack, although there are no errors when compiling any other program

Is there an endpoint to retrieve a list of RPC servers?  Looking to sort them by response time
I am trying to deploy a program to devnet, but keep getting the following error (I am behind a proxy). I tried google search but haven't found much useful info. Can anyone help me out here? 

```
Error: Pubsub error: ConnectionError(Url(UnableToConnect("wss://api.devnet.solana.com/")))
There was a problem deploying: Output { status: ExitStatus(unix_wait_status(256)), stdout: "", stderr: "" }.
```
should the length of a slot be trusted upon when making dapps that rely on some time-units? Like for options for example, should i rely on precalculated slot height for expiry?
I set up my express backend with endpoint for sending transactions, but it takes more than 30s for Solana to send transaction. 30s is heroku max timeout. Any ideas?
Yep there is a huge amount of txs I do though. Bit lost in the mud
look through all the possible keypairs that you could have used. if there were any transaction ids, maybe that can help identify the pubkey of the keypair you used?
welp ser i am sorry
No pneumonic given for these 2 for some reason

ive had stack frame violations cause anchor to _not_ generate IDLs... are you sure theres no obvious errors when you `cargo build-bpf`?
I've tried calling ``cargo build-bpf`` myself but IDL file is still not created.
Hi, I'm using WSL2.0 for solana frameworks (anchor). For some reason ``anchor build``  that calls ``cargo build-bpf`` does not create an IDL file. Should I just install ubuntu in dual loader with Windows?
Is this sol lost?
I had 2 recent mainnet deploys that failed, I dont seem to have any pending program buffers but cant recover the sol that was transferred out of my upgrade authority.
Ok! Thx )
Oh yes, much better.... or a mac if you have one
That is, it is better to work on Linux?

Thanks for the answer!
or if its that important to use windows, maybe try downloading an older binary?

Hello everyone 

Recently I ran into a problem when installing Solana on Windows.

I do everything as on the official website, but when downloading, I download an empty file, which then cannot be opened. 

I open the command line with the administrator mode.
You should spin up WSL and Ubuntu and operate from there.... Windows has sketchy behavior
yea `some_process_instruction` fn
this will go inside the process_instruction fn?
suppose this convention 
```
        let seeds = &[
            PREFIX.as_ref(),
            BENEFIT_TOKEN.as_ref(),
            oracle_key.as_ref(),
            treasury_bump_bytes.as_ref(),
        ];
        let signer = &[&seeds[..]];
        let cpi = CpiContext::new_with_signer(
            ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
            transfer_cpx,
            signer,
        );
        token::transfer(
            cpi,
            (100 as f64 * 10_usize.pow(treasury_mint.decimals as u32) as f64) as u64,
        )?;
```
ohh.. just like lets say i deploy a program X which contains some business login and has some lamports. Now to interact with it from client, i need to create a separate keypair and fund SOL to make transaction. I could use a relay network (something like gas station), but honestly don't want to. so would this PDA work?
you can take a look at https://solanacookbook.com/core-concepts/pdas.html#program-derived-addresses-pdas
a PDA is an account which only a correspond program can sign it
You can invoke signed ixs for program accounts from inside the contract instruction
hello, im new to solana but im trying to build a smart contract wallet but since the account model is so different from EVM, is it possible to sign a transaction using "program" account rather than a normal key-pair.
maybe https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs
hello, can someone tell me what are requirements for rpc node?
no idea
even installing from binaries doesnt works
i havent used windows in years so lets hope someone with wsl background replies
but nothing
and then running 
C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe v1.10.8
trying to install it from command:
curl https://release.solana.com/v1.10.8/solana-install-init-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe --output C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe --create-dirs
sounds like `solana` is no longer part of your `$PATH` env var
just updated solana with:
solana-install updates
got an error and now i can't run any solana command anymore, it' says: 
'solana' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

tryed to reinstall from zero but same issue, the installation is not working too

any one running on the same issue of have idea how to fix it ?
no problem!
Thanks
I guess I'll look into webassembly
webassembly ftw
I'm sure it's possible, but why do this way if there are easier and efficient ways to do this already.
My plan is a little different, I'm planning on compiling the react app for Solana adapter to Js html and css and then using it with the flask micro web framework for python for handling everything.
this returns a transaction message which is constructed in ts then signed by wallet adapter
here is a working example of preparing an instruction in Go, which is compiled to webassembly, https://github.com/whymidnight/someplace/blob/master/wasm/go/integrations/sell.go
then use wallet adapter to sign the transactions
i use webassembly to prepare instructions
http backends are bad for web3 unless they are purely returning metrics, encoded instructions, deserialized data.
So you verified signature using web assembly?
Learning though
I'm not very good with Js/ts for the backend so I have trying to find way I can do this using the most amount of python.
without having to expose keys or introduce unnecssary permissions problems
this way you can encode/decode locally
i ran into an issue where js/ts complexity was getting out of hand so instead of serving an http backend, i just used webassembly for the lower level stuff that would have otherwise been this endpoint
If we can interact with that using python it should good
Well, I don't know about other wallets but phantom wallet injects the Solana object to the window of the web application
defeats the premise of web3, if the user cant authorize a tx themselves
I basically am trying to use python as my backend
Ok got it. Thanks.
just return a 200 back because if and only if the wallet is connected are you able to sign
Is there anyone working on a flask python version of Solana adapter?
Nice. After verification I'd prob need to send it back to the app to authorize I guess
you can sign a message using wallet adapter in js/ts, then post the message and pubkey to your http endpoint, then verify
i cant install the solana tool suite
i think i found the main problem
I'm trying to get the signed message from the Solana wallet adapter and use python to verify it. Just trying to find some resources to help me with it
Hi, I was looking at the Solana wallet adapter. Have you worked with it's integration with python?
yh
Hi any python developers here?
does `Keypair Path: priv.key` exist when you `solana config get`?
what is going wrong
anyone can help please
found the issue, thanks
oh sure, thanks. just a min
debug the error using `await connection.simulateTransaction(transaction)`

hey guys! wondering if there are any tools that can let me airdrop SPL tokens to 400 wallets. I do not know CLI and Rust so I am heavily relying on tools temporarily until we move into another method.
after which time, you can say that a transaction won't get confirmed anymore
well it's a personal choice but on-chain program would make it a lot simpler
Not sure why I'm getting this error, the function below was working fine earlier:
```ts
export const depositSOL = async (
  to: web3.PublicKey,
  amount: number,
) => {
  const connection = new web3.Connection(getRPC()) // returns custom devnet rpc cluster, though api.devnet.solana.com doesn't work either
  const wallet = getWallet() // returns window.solana
  const publicKey = await connectWallet(true, false);
  const blockhash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash('finalized');
  const transaction = new web3.Transaction().add(
    web3.SystemProgram.transfer({
      fromPubkey: publicKey,
      toPubkey: to,
      lamports: amount * web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
    }),
  );
  transaction.recentBlockhash = blockhash.blockhash;
  transaction.feePayer = publicKey;
  const { signature } = await wallet.signAndSendTransaction(transaction);
  const res = await connection.confirmTransaction(signature);
  return res;
};
```
Hello, would you have any useful docs on calculating the additional fee when increasing the compute budget?
Do you mind sharing your full snippet? I seem to still be getting the same error after adding `...new BN(0).toArray('le', 4)`

i just think a backend makes more sense than using a smart contract for my use case
naw it's just a typical backend that does things if the user pays üòÖ
Is this fixed already? Thank you.
why not make an on-chain program?
are you also building ledger authentication? lol i just came in to ask a similar question
paying devs $$ for help on deploying a contract & making it functional on a site, DM me if you're interested. Solana Web3 based
It appears that the npm package's ``sendAndConfirmRawTransaction`` doesn't error if I send multiple of the same transaction signature.
This of course only gets processed once by the solana network, but is there a built-in way to track if a user attempts to send a duplicate raw transaction?
Or is my best bet to track this myself, by blacklisting a transaction signature after it's been used once?
I have a backend that sends a raw transaction on behalf of a user.
Here's the workflow:
- Frontend has the user sign a transaction directly from their wallet.
- Frontend serializes the transaction, and sends it off to the backend
- Backend deserializes the transaction, and sends the raw transaction.

The backend then checks for anything malicious:
- Recipient must be what we expect it to be
- Lamports should be an expected amount
- Transaction should only contain a sol transfer instruction, and nothing else

Afterwards, the backend assumes the transaction is not malicious, and allows the user to use the service as intended.

Is there any obvious mistakes with this approach?
Scams are always going on
is here somone i can talk to about a solana scam going on
helllo
rather than just blocking me
I hope it pays off
it's another mini learning curve
now I'm revisiting Solana development, but trying Anchor out
man, I used pure Rust/Solana in my last project. and this was considering how I had mostly programmed in just JS (node.js). it was indeed tough.
raw Solana glass chewing is little bit too hard on my stomach üòõ
Cli 1.8 worked for me. Thanks!
oh yes, for sure. Anchor is awesome
<@910303929714237470> do you build using anchor?
yes it was using this 'other' program ID. 
but yeah after I updated everywhere to use this other program ID, it worked.
but still that 'other' program ID was not showing anywhere. I had the 'stock' program_id in anchor.toml and declare_id macro
When I search solana explorer devent for the program id I just deployed, I see transactions 8 hours old... even though I just deployed.
oooh. hrmmm. I wonder if I overwrote it by mistake.
yes I'm on Anchor!
mmh .. do you use anchor? Because when you build a project for the first time you will get a new program id assigned which is stored in the Anchor.toml
Not sure if the declare_id macro or the id in the Anchor.toml wins üôÇ
the default script doesn't expect solana to be congested, and it fails if there is high congestion
yea but funnily there was the stock ID but it was deploying to another address
Usually you have the declare_id macro in your rust program. So it is a static pub key and it gets deployed there.
https://docs.rs/solana-program/1.4.3/solana_program/macro.declare_id.html
coming from Solidity/Ethereum, I know it seems weird
if you run `solana logs` when you redeploy you'll see a message saying `program upgraded`
it's normal
I solved this! No idea why. But the program_id I was using was following the doc's which was Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS. It was in the anchor.toml, lib.rs and index.js

However I was noticing that when I deploy, it was a different address logged. So I updated anchor.toml, lib.rs and index.js to that address. That fixed the program not exist error.
Hello? Anybody here?
I would expect each deploy to deploy to a new address / program id
is that normal?
Against devnet
I keep getting the same program id when I run `$ solana program deploy`
yes, I understand, but I installed everything, even tried to reinstall the machine, nothing helps
<@933338058357624852> looks like maybe gumdrop-cli isn't installed
I'm an experienced developer, but brand new to Solana and have  quick question.
hello
i have an issue
can anyone halp me?
`Error: Cannot find module './gumdrop-cli.ts'`

for this command
`ts-node ./metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/gumdrop-cli.ts create --k seller.json --claim-integration transfer --transfer-mint ToHnXU7bpho53Z5HEiTFDGLJVa7oDQ2yKhxnPy8fTEM --distribution-method wallets --distribution-list dislist.json`
my client side code has this:
```
    accounts: {
      myAccount: myAccount.publicKey,
      user: user.publicKey,
      systemProgram: anchor.web3.SystemProgram.programId,
    },
```

both myAccount and user are created with `web3.Keypair.generate()` 

is the attempt to load program error relating to these accounts that don't exist or to the Program Account?
Is anyone else still having issues with devnet or just me? Noticing the status page seems to show 0 TPS, wondering if the issues are ongoing?
?
ok they're the same network. how do I 'create' an account based on a pubkey in localnet? I tried to aidrop SOL to it but when I run `solana account ACCOUNT_ID` it returned 'account not found'
Please an answerüò©
generally `Attempt to load a program that does not exist`  points to referencing a program id in an instruction that is part of your transaction that does not exist. so first step would be to verify the network, and existence of the program, id, and network status. and make sure the one being referenced in the instruction and transaction is pointing to the same network and has the correct Id.
Have there been people facing issues on M1? I'm looking at this issue thread: https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/issues/876
<@717956950737813594> thanks for helping me out, I finally overcame the error! I had to just call `accounts()` rather than pass the Context as the second arg, even though I had arg to pass.
Hi all, if I get `SendTransactionError: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Attempt to load a program that does not exist` what should I look into?
Hi everyone I need how to add metadata to spl token (contract), Who has a tutorial pleas share with me that. Thank you
api.devnet.solana.com seems to work now üôÇ
If I want to use nonces as per https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/durable-tx-nonces
and say I'm signing 5 tx, then handing them off to a crank. 
then I need 5 nonce accounts? 
Bc I must supply tx.recentBlockhash before signature and it must match the current nonce stored in the nonce account. And with each use that value changes.
Can someone confirm my assumption real quick?
Are blockhashes supposed to be unique every time you run ``getRecentBlockhash``?
My commitment level is set to ``finalized``, but I seem to be receiving the same blockhash when this is run a bunch of times with a short delay
Rip ü•≤
maybe theres a large queue of tx now which makes some fail or so. idk
still a bit flaky, but seems to work more and more lol
ü•≤
Devent working fine now ?
ah now its ok again lol
yh for me also 2 went through, but then it crashed again xD
2 times in a row
tx went trough now
oh
Just thought it got back up
ye saw that
mmm :/
see <#749059399875690557>
yh, devnet is still down it seems
added a question on stackoverflow if anyone wants to support https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71897315/solana-computebudget-in-typescript-sdk
My transactions can't confirm somehow, is this because of the devnet problem?
when I run 
```

    );

    const additionalComputeIx = new TransactionInstruction({

      programId: new PublicKey("ComputeBudget111111111111111111111111111111"),
      data,
    });
    const tx = new TransactionEnvelope(mt.sdk.provider, [additionalComputeIx]);
    const sig = await tx.confirm();
    console.log("requested more compute!", sig);
```

I get `invalid instruction`. any idea why this could be?
man, been waiting for like 12 hours üòÖ. nvm it just stopped again
it seems to work now
plsss
any RPC provider that is up already?
also still down ...
Explorer isn‚Äôt showing telemetry either as of now
Like mordonez said, the requests still fail
It's still down on `api.devnet.solana.com`
After the restart it got rid the failed txns but now i get 503 error
Testing the `solana-keygen` subcommand `recover` which should compute seed phrase. The generated public key is different from the expected one, I have as public key in the wallet. Importing the seed phrase via wallet generates the expected public key, so wonder why the `solana-keygen` is different? Any clue?

Why do I always get a `WalletNotSelectedError` when doing the following:

im sure all the autistic monkeys are finishing up their adderall water about now so they can swiftly fix devnet
(the question is, if I get the same error when devnet is UP)
the method `confirmTransaction` gives this error `Error: Transaction was not confirmed in 60.72 seconds. It is unknown if it succeeded or failed. Check signature 27pNGTTVdAu23n2FV6noToM27BXf3LS8v4boHMb28J8u1DGrLswHETiPvxEoMJQJ6mkVD4zzfKmeQezd1BeniAXU using the Solana Explorer or CLI tools.`
Reason: devnet is DOWN
But my real question is... is there away to really know if a transaction has failed for some reason programatically? Or we need to rely on manually check on solana explorer ?
Will my application work if i point it testnet
Hi all, i have a basic application to create an account, transfer and create token in devnet
can devs do something #devnet
read the text, error finding openssl.. lookup install of openssl, and you might need to set some shell env variables to target the openssl path once it is installed
?
how i can fix it
to be honest i glad to see one error instead of 2
damn... there are one more error left
nice..  where is the starving hacker foundation when you need one??  where are our political leaders in addressing the growing crisis of this underserved community!!??
Hey guys, is the devnet working for you? `solana airdrop 1` on the CLI gives me an `Error: unable to confirm transaction`
i think it has changed to where you call a static method from `spltoken.Token` class..

i believe there is no `getorcreate` anymore, it has been changed to two separated methods, where you getassociatedaddress, and then you have to create the instruction for the txn separately
can anyone please help me by answering this question, how to send rent lamports back from data account to the programOwner if we used minimum rent exempt at the time of data account creation?
cheers everyone. i was wondering if anyone could help expand on the onProgramAccountChange pub/sub mechanics.  

* i'm wondering if this event is triggered for an account that is deleted or removed, or if i am subscribing with a filter matching bytes of account data, how i would need to detect changes and deletions..
* for pub/sub of an account that is "deleted" would i need to detect withdraws of rent of an account (effectively, does "delete" an account?)
* does anyone know the best type of oil to use on perfectly sculpted abs?  (i can't stop starring in the mirror)

There was a channel here thats now archieved <#627964701690691601> and I dont see anything about it on  telegram.  I had some questions about the process beyond an faq or grant page which I have read
Getting a Module '"@solana/spl-token"' has no exported member 'getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount'. Seems that some users in their repositories have this one imported to their projects, any changes?

How can I get the nft `buy/sell price` of a token from a transaction?

hey peeps, I'm working through a CTF challenge rn with Solana in Rust. If I pass, I get a much needed job (Offensive Blockchain Security Engineer). Maybe tmi here but, I'm homeless atm, and go find wifi wherever I can. This job would literally change my life, so I really have to nail this. I meet with some of their engineers later tonight, and want to have a report & showcase r2g. This is just the context, below is the technical part:

 I identified the vulnerability as: Missing Account Validator Checks within a processor.(rs) file, here's a snip:

It seems that neither deposit nor withdraw functions validate addresses and ownership of the user-supplied accounts. Which would allow me to just add any address I want sort of like a redirect. The main vuln function (i think) is the "token_transfer"

My question is this: how could I provide a poof-of-concept of this? The company wants screenshots as well as a formal report (thankfully they sent me a template). How should showcase this happening in real time? Is there way? Or would it be more of a static showcase? 

Any help would go so far üôè  thank you thank thank you!
yes, its down

so cant send transactions on devnet right now?

just use getnfts one
u can ignore it
i don't think u have any use case for mintids.ts
for metaplex
it's default
that's it
then what is program id ?
mintids.ts is for fetching nfts from a public key
no, no
program id??
and do i have to made changes in the mintids.ts
and utils.ts should be in the same folder
u just have to put mintid that's it
Btw, can I pass this connection to `Metadata.load()`?
```js
const { Connection, clusterApiUrl, PublicKey } = require("@solana/web3.js");
const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl('mainnet-beta'), 'confirmed');```
okk
it is default for metaplex
dont change that
that's default
but <@838841424832495646>  where can i get metadata_pubkey?
anyone knows?
i decided to try linux and what this errors mean
in that replace the mintid to your nft id
can u see that?

is there any python guide or instructions
I know what I'm doing, but like obv I wanted to test it on devnet beforehand :/
might have to just yolo it and deploy everything to mainnet instead of testing on devnet lmaoo

SendTransactionError: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Transaction leaves an account with a lower balance than rent-exempt minimum.

you can use metaplax rpc to get metadata:

const tokenMetadata = await programs.metadata.Metadata.load(connection, metadataPDA);
console.log('nft metadata: ', tokenMetadata.data);

hopefully itll be up within the next hour or ill be grrrrrrr again XD
do you know for how long ?
i read this related to my bug - 

If you get the following error Error: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds, it often means that the devnet faucet is drained and you should try again a bit later. You can also try requesting fewer SOLs and see if it works.

someone knows when this should resolve?
devnet is down guys
i keep getting this error when trying to airdrop to my account - 
This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds...

not sure if this channel is the right place to ask this, but as we know ethereum tokens follow the 18 decimals standard, but token amount on solana are stored in a u64, someone told me the standard is 9 decimals on solana, from that we find that the max amount that can be represented by a u64 after setting asside 9 decimals is 18 billion ? if so how are tokens migrating to solana handling this ? if anyone has any idea do let me know.

you can take a look at Anchor's tutorial, it's easy to understand https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/tutorials/tutorial-0.html. or you can just go to Solana's github and select one of the programs(like spl token program) to learn https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token
Could you please refer one? I'm new to this and not finding any
there are a lot of code examples online, you can just google it
Thanks <@840391332341350420> . Do you have any reference for this on how to do?
user can "login" by connecting their wallet to you web portal. and you may need to create a user account for  each user to save their identities or other data. And usually ONLY the user's wallet address is allowed to modify  the data in user account

OH my god you are literally a hero, thank you so much!!!!
na, it's just https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
Are there any guides to get access to this or do I need to specifically get permissions from the foundation?
yeah I think the foundation nodes will have that.  It's stored in BigTable

Right now I'm using figment but can only query down to ~epoch 250
Gotcha thank you! then are there nodes down to say epoch 100?
epoch 0 didn't have inflation enabled.  I forget offhand exactly when it was enabled, I want to say around epoch 100-ish
is there any such thing as a node I can query getInflationReward down to epoch 0?
yes, scroll up

Maybe not last 2 hours.  I've been not able to utilize it since Friday.  Airdrop, deploy not working still.
it's down at the moment, it looks like it's been having a pretty rough time over the last 2 hours or so
What's going on with DevNet?  I can't transact anything - not from wallet to wallet nor to get 1 2 SOL airdrop.  Anything going on?
Am I going crazy? Is it possible for `getSignaturesForAddress` to return transaction that happen before my `until` parameter? From looking at my logs, it looks like this is happening. I think I'm running into this issue which is making pagination tricky. https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/24417

<@445425471027544095> can we get https://twitter.com/SolanaDevnet updated with the current outage, and again when it is resolved? Also the status link https://sola.na/status is returning 522, so this is a pretty good outage.
What are `process_initialize_account`, `process_initialize_account2`,  .. in spl-token program?
oh okay, so  basically there is no actual signature, just check if this program has that PDA
The runtime pretends like a signature was presented in this case, even though that's impossible since no private key exists.  Basically it toggles a bit üôÇ
Cool, and thank you for your clarification, I fully understand that PDA can't have a private, but how can the program do the signing (I know the Solana run time allows this and a given PDA can only be "signed" by the program from which it is derived )  but the signer should have a private Key to sign! so where is the program(signer)'s private Key
Gotcha, thanks!
https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/965436957503152178
Am I doing something wrong, or can someone else confirm network issues on devnet?
solfaucet also not working
Can someone provide a working example?
By construction, there is no private key corresponding to a PDA. The Solana runtime allows a program to "sign" a CPI by supplying the seeds used to generate the PDA in question (which already includes the program id as part of the seed). Since the program address is immutable, the runtime simply enforces that a given PDA can only be "signed" by the program from which it is derived.
Unable to airdrop sol on devnet with example commands I'm finding online
Did you look at AWS Secrets Manager? (though note that if you have a large number of keys to store it could get expensive)
Hello. I am trying to get the responses from the getConfirmedTransaction method in web3.js. 
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getConfirmedTransaction
Does the response ever change depending on the endpoint of the RPC server? I have this question because the response was different for https://ssc-dao.genesysgo.net and https://explorer-api.mainnet-beta.solana.com.
thanks for the update !!!
Thanks !!!
Same
Same question, having issues on my end as well
Hi there,
I'm new to Solana dev community, 
I was looking at PDA and PCI, I understand that PDA that derived from the programId and the program can sign on behave of its accounts,
so "as I understand" PDA can verify the program signature.
my question is: how can the program actually generate a signature? Does it has a private key stored in the Solana runtime or what??
It happens when there is congestion on the network, the tx might get dropped so you need to implement a retrying logic (this happens more often when you use a free rpc)
Sorry, did anyone encounter "Error: Transaction was not confirmed in 30.01 seconds. It is unknown if it succeeded or failed." this error? I was running the same program this afternoon but now I keep getting the same error message.
No problem, glad it helped!
yes it's down. The team will look into debugging what happened and recovering it on Monday
seems so..
Which function can be used instead of getMultipleSolanaAccounts() of @project-serum/common library?

I want to store private keys but I want to be able to store them from the api, the api will only have access to write and not read (in case of a hack attack). To read them is manually, meaning that a person has to manually extract it

technically speaking, an NFT is a token with a max supply of 1 so check for that condition and check if its metadata account exists too

Any idea why a transaction will work on the devnet but not mainnet?

I deployed with vercel and can do devnet transactions fine, but mainnet it tells me this transaction may fail and it does
I have a program that's working great on devnet, but when I try deploying it to mainnet, it's super slow to write to the buffer or fails completely. The odd part is that it gets to ~50% before the first blockhash expires. Then it slows down a ton. Ideas?

when upgrading my program and redirecting it to the program id with the --program-id flag it says that redeployment requrie a keypair instead of the program id any idea as to what is up with that?
When I try to allocate 5mb on one account I get an error (I use localnet). Do you know why this can happen?
Error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: Failed to reallocate account data
No worries at all! Good luck üôÇ
Thanks a lot! I'll follow that path. And sorry for not helping with your issue but I have no clue on how to üòÖ
I might be convinced that upping the default timeout to 2 minutes and just retrying it till it confirms or denies the transaction might be the way to go :/
On a slow day maybe 3-5 minutes? I'm not so sure honestly
Realistically, how long would you say the average confirmation takes?
I mean, I could also increase the timeout, but I might encounter the same issue if the transaction's still not finalized
Oh okay, I see what you're saying
Thanks! But I'm actually already doing that, my issue is that after 60s of awaiting it, it throws an error if the transaction did not reach the commitment. What I was thinking about doing if that happens, call the confirmation again; and if that failes, again and again and so on.... But I don't like that approach that much
I mean -- I'm having issues verifying transactions as well lol, but for the most part this works for me
Do an await on the transaction till you have a receipt <@160923223133782016>
Hi! üëã I'm using web3js and trying to confirm that a transaction is `finalized` but `confirmTransaction` times out after a minute. I was thinking about calling the same method over and over until it reaches my desired status but I'm not sure that's the best way to do it, does anyone might know a better approach or solution?
Was wondering if anyone else has had this problem:

```var option = {from:App.handler}
await App.contracts.MyContract.methods.test_method(testVariable).send(option)
    .on('receipt',(receipt)=>
        {
          if(receipt.status)
          {
            console.log("success");
            console.log("code snippet A goes here");
          }}).on('error',(err)=>
        {
                console.log("failure");
            console.log("code snippet B goes here");
        
          })

console.log("code snippet C goes here");```

(app.js code for my Dapp)

When this smart contract interaction goes through (without speeding it up with metamask) -- it always works and I get either success or failure based on the result and it continues through execution to where I have code snippet C.

HOWEVER

If I speed up a transaction and replace the gas price with something higher than when I initially accept the transaction -- even though it goes through and gets recorded on the blockchain and in my smart contract, neither code snippet A, B or C runs. It's like a promise that never resolves? Unsure what to do about this. I've tried taking out the await and wrapping it another promise / another function but nothing works. It completely ends code execution.
Rust is more common

Hello üëã I'm studying solana and I was wondering, is it possible to access the transaction signature/id from within a program that it's processing an instruction of that transaction? I looked at the rust documentation of `solana_program` but didn't find any clue
please anyone can help?
This returns empty for the vote program
I am using solana airdrop 2
Hi,

i am getting an error while airdrop on devnet that "unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds

Yep
Has been ded
That's what I was trying but ran into this:
just use cli
Beautiful, just have to wait for the devnet to be up and functional again huh?
I think you can get up to 20SOL using the Solana cli

Welcome to the club
I'll have a look, thanks man!
I suggest that you go to <#763249718339567626> and have some reading before that would help you to start your journey on Solana.
Oh, that's nice to know, thank you!!
yes you pay but with fake sol. So basically you create a wallet and fund it using the following command: `solana airdrop 1`
in dev/test net i don't need to pay for deploying?
```js
const myToken = new splToken.Token(
            connection,
            mint,
            splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
            new web3.PublicKey(global.config.casino.publicKey),
          );```
getting error `Unhandled Rejection at: TypeError: splToken.Token is not a constructor`
On the MainNet no you can't. So i suggest to play around on localhost:8899, DevNet or TestNet. Please check the following document https://docs.solana.com/clusters

can't I just burn it by sending a token from the wallet to an address? Is CLI Required?
4 days of downtime?!?

Hi I am trying to make an airdrop to my wallet on devnet to be able to deploy a candy-machine and I can't do it because the network is down.
Is there any expectation of time to know when the devnet problem is going to be solved because it has been down for two days and we can't develop?
Ok guyes. Anyone knows how to check if given address is NFT or not.

I think I need to very:
- given address is token address and not really any user account/program_id or anything else
- supply is only 1
- decimals is 0
- and noone have authority to mint more of same token.

What shall I do. Or is there any other way
ok thx a lot
I saw some program on the Explore site, there is an Address Label, for example, System Program, Token Program.  But when I deployed my program.  There's no such label.  I just wonder if there's a way I can add one for my program.
I don't understand the usecase. Can you explain in more detail?
Sorry, ask again?  Anyone know how to add an address label to a program?  Thanks a lot!
mint of tokens means generating tokens from the token mint account. for example if you have a token mint account xyz for the token abc. Minting means create more abc token from the account xyz
one or two days later
When's devnet going to go back up?
ok, and what would be the mint of an token?
minting means creating supply from a token mint account. When you create a token you basically create a mint account from which you can mint (or generate) additional tokens
how is devnet still down??
I have a simple terminology question, what exactly does it mean to mint a token? And what exactly is a mint?
difference between solana address vs public key? is the address is derived from base58 encoding the public key?
Can someone help me with serialization data from solana?
testnet is working.
hello, if you're testing your program, how do I mock or change the cluster time?

You should run this on a different command line interface instance. It is working like an app server. Meaning when it is stopped you cannot make a request...
Then you can airdrop to your local wallet.

EDIT: Do not forget to configure your `solana` cli with `solana config set --url localhost`
maybe tmr
When will the devnet back?
I‚Äôm using `@solana/web3.js` npm lib to listen to `<Connection>.onLogs()` of an specified wallet. Is there any chance the connection will drop and onLogs will get terminated? Does the lib handle connection drops automatically?
should i use my own rpc ? (dont have testnet rpc yet)
i guess will wait for devnet xd
installed the CLI but whatever command i run is just like this
is testnet and devnet same? can we run testnet and do work of devnet? of is testnet used for another thing?
devnet is down. no specific eta yet. a potential fix may have been identified. an alternative for now is to use a test validator:  https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator
When is the devnet going to be online again
I'm wondering if how do you add image & description on spl-tokens, just like regular nft. 
I received example (scammer's) spl-token, and  it's being displayed in my nfts wallet tab instead of tokens list tab.   When I click the link to solscan it shows as a regular unrecognized spl-token..
Read further up.....
Oh! Devnet is down? Hmm, is there any way to check the devnet status?
Try reading the message right above tours...
Unable to airdrop. Any idea?

<@709883330472050768> if you check the chat history you will see that devnet is down. (If you configured solana cli for devnet). If your solana cli is configured for local, you should start solana-test-validator. You can check your config with `solana config get`
I'm trying to create a token and in the docs says to execute the command `solana airdrop 1`, but isn't working.

```
unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds
END_BALANCE = 33.953231812 SOL
```
which doesn't sound right üòâ
because in case using libraries they have hard coded the contract addresses
is it possible to upload contract on localnet and access it using same id as of devnet?
amazes me how few people skim the backlog before asking the exact same question as the last ten people

<@809198824539160606>  would you help? Big thanks in advance
yeah thanks, i just noticed that
Devnet is down
Your best bet would be to look through the metaplex npm packages to see how they do it internally. On a high level, you need to get the metadata PDA (and master/edition PDA) if they exist for a potential NFT and parse their account data which is serialized using borsh.
anyone has an idea whats up phantom wallet, its not responding positively
Thanks for the update, good to hear the root cause is found.
I'm sure I am making this complicated. It's like 3 am and I'm dead tired.
I have 2 tokens, 1 was created on account 1 with that authority, the 2nd was created on account 2 with that authority.
I want to change it so the 2nd token has the 1st accounts authority.
That way I can send and control the token using my 1st accounts keypair.
Basically devnet did its job and you all found a critical bug before it was too late!!  We have a procedure where new platform features are first enabled on testnet, then devnet, and finally mainnet. This allows  real-world users to exercise the new code paths before on mainnet, and gives us confidence that instability will not be introduced on mainnet. In this case due to the heavy usage of devnet, we caught a fringe bug that could have potentially taken down mainnet. We needed to ensure that mainnet was first not affected before communicating more, for obvious reasons.  

So, well, thanks for using devnet and being the final gate üôÇ
Also sorry for the inconvenience. Hopefully we're back up within day or two at the worst
thank u: ) now it finally works
just sharing the news, credit goes to the team
That's a good news, thanks for u help.
On the optimistic side, it looks like we've identified the issue [1] and hopefully will be able to get devnet back up tomorrow.  We do hear your screams!

[1] https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/24471
u mean is the time when nobody care about DEVNET?
yeah we just delay restarting by another hour every time someone asks
had nothing to do with the upgrade. it was a feature activation
Yes, but it taking too long. DEV is dead for two days, after the restart and upgrade to 1.9.16
Yea not trying to throw shade, just has a big impact at the moment, clearly the amount of people who cant read or dont care to read keep asking the same question lol

Hey, I'm using a custom RPC to send transaction on mainnet through Phantom, however the transaction is failing with the error code `-32003`. This is my code:
```ts
export const depositSOL = async (

  amount: number,
) => {
  const connection = new web3.Connection(getRPC()) // returns custom RPC url
  const wallet = getWallet(); // returns window.phantom
  const publicKey = await connectWallet(true, false);
  const blockhash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash('finalized');
  const transaction = new web3.Transaction().add(
    web3.SystemProgram.transfer({
      fromPubkey: publicKey,
      toPubkey: to,
      lamports: amount * web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL, // because the amount is in SOL
    }),
  );
  transaction.recentBlockhash = blockhash.blockhash;
  transaction.feePayer = publicKey;
  const { signature } = await wallet.signAndSendTransaction(transaction);
  const res = await connection.confirmTransaction(signature);
  return res;
};

Simulate transaction works, however this one doesn't
Does anybody known, what happened for DEVNET? It's died for two days.

Has anyone had issues trying to paginate transactions with `getSignaturesForAddress`? I'm getting some pretty weird anomalies where it looks like the `until` parameter isn't respected. This github comment is exactly what I'm running into https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/24417#issuecomment-1101969015
is this problem solved? the same problem with me

I get the humor but we should get a little more explanation than this especially when testnet is unusable as well
on miannet btw
is the network still clogged? I am seeing this right now, it looks good to me, but im still getting the "blockhash not found" error
let me know if you run into an issue again
But appreciated.
Ah ye tbc I was able to deploy successfully on mainnet separately, my buffers were just on testnet.
I haven't implemented resuming if the program panics, so you need to close the buffer and retry to get your sol back
The more useful one was the second ><
Oh, well yea
It's probably what you said, if you set max retries to 10 and it hasn't confirmed on any of them then the program will panic
Sorry I didn't save it then, dumb of me
Appreciated though <3.
Apologies, we're just testing on mainnet atm in prep for mint this week, don't have it saved ;_;
you can increase `MAX_RETRIES` in the .env if you want to have higher retries
hey, can you dm me the error you get?
Did you figure this out?
Currently metaplex only supports mainnet and devnet.
So looking through the metaplex code, and now anchor, anchor definitely supports connecting to localhost. So there definitely has to be a way to modify the metaplex modules to allow for connections to localhost, and even testnet.
welcome to the party
yes
Is the devnet down rn?
lol niiice 
sometimes ya literally gotta run everything üíÄ
I did not, but thanks for the suggestion - it led me to check out the helper functions available for the 'solana-test-validator' command and I think I fixed it by just running 'solana-test-validator --reset'. I'm not sure why it needed to be reset though
im just guessing
do u have a validator alr running?

Or even if it supported testnet.
Would be great if it supported local clusters. Run against your own devnet.
Out of the I'm looking through the metaplex code now to see what it would take to make it work with local clusters as an option

wow devnet still down solana #trash
Trying to run upload against a local cluster, but getting an error about no prior credit - even though there is a balance
Does anyone know if metaplex candy-machine-v2 supports local / localhost for uploads?
I've been reading up on https://solanacookbook.com/references/nfts.html - does anyone have any references that could allow me to get NFT data with just web3.js and not use Metaplex functions?

As you can see, I am using the recommended version for testnet wc is 1.10.8

Is testnet down as well?
I have a wallet address at the 44' /501' derivation path, which is the ledger default...anyone know how to access this wallet with solflare or sollet? its not picking it up
can we run test on testnet?
Devs away for Easter?
Yesh, you're right - no post today in announcements, just the one from Saturday to say its working
Agreed. Biggest thing is there has been little to no communication about the issue, eta to fix, etc. No mention of it on the SolanaStatus twitter account, no mention in <#749059399875690557>. Outages are understandable. Radio silence is not.

Tps and ping is more reliable to check this weekend's issues
The status has been a bit useless all weekend
so...
Still unable to airdrop sol on devnet
status is now yellow https://status.solana.com/
Nothing new in <#749059399875690557> so assume so
devnet still down?
$ solana config set --url localhost

$ solana-test-validator

$ solana logs
found them:

and the command to stream logs
Anybody have the command handy to start a local solana cluster?
If I have a validator identity, is there any way to get the validator Vote Key?
Hi all where do we ask noob questions ? I am playing with spl-token program and need some clarification, thanks
Testnet does not support candymachine
This is true
i' m trying, thanks
^?
if you rollback to 1.37.1, the issue goes away
Having the same problem suddently
But that's wild supposition
My guess is metaplex doesn't support testnet (or at least, the deployed version doesn't support that collection instruction)
Getting same error as others in this Github thread: https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/issues/2065
Tried running upload via candymachine against test net
Also seeing issues with testnet.
hahahha take it easy
whats the difference between devnet and testnet?
Np. Back to bashing my head against trying to get a program uploaded atm -_-
cool bro thanks for the info!
https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet when transactions are > 0 you'll know it's on its way back up. And yea, big üò¶
üò¶
For now, it was broken this morning
Breaking change got pushed up
testnet is working?
u know why?
ohh cool thanks for the info
Devnet is down

Devnet is completely down atm, no ETA on it coming back up that I know of
hello mates, devnet is working? beacuse im using candymachine to upload some nfts and it gives me a fail to upload
Also idk if this is meant to be an official stopgap tool while devnet is down/other clusters are under load, but with acheron being offline is there someone else I should ping on this?

EDIT: Nvm forgot that Developer was the public role, this probably isn't officially supported
My config atm:

On next test on testnet, I'm getting a 408. Is there a recommended set of config for this?
<@938658528229462126> Taking a look at your deployer script, if you hit max retries the program panics - is there any way to resume from a buffer if that happens?
hello, why do I get this error whe nsending transaction with solana web3 js:
`Transaction mutated after being populated from Message` ? thanks
Nice!
ah nice, I just used this https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/tree/master/packages/starter/create-react-app-starter and worked out well
you might need to polyfill
atleast testnet is working
hello
anyone know when is devnet up ?
It worked
Moved up react scripts to 5.0.0
<@215199174495436811> did you get around this issue by any chance? I have been having the same issue as you using the CRA4 fix
yeah, clearing the authority on the mint will prevent any new tokens from being created. But you'll still be able to create new token accounts for that token and they'll still be able to transfer tokens among themselves.
I just want to know if I have to deploy my own version of gemfarm to utilize the functionalities of the built in rarities. 

As in, will I have to deploy my own versions for the rarities to create rarity-biased token generation for different NFTs
Anyone here experienced with using rarities on gemfarm?
I would test everything with devnet beforehand, but I can't because of the devnet outage.
`IF ANYONE IS LOOKING TO REPLICATE AND USE NFTS ON LOCALNET`

> you basically need to clone your  `wallet address`, `program idl`(if you're fetching), `nft mint addr`, `nft holder account addr`, and `nft metadata address` through the `Anchor.toml` file.

Here's my Anchor.toml:

```
# wallet
[[test.validator.clone]]
address = "ViVDtpVYKdhRRH9FTKsh6reJB9xXUqpX1233BSDZWRQ"

# program idl
[[test.validator.clone]]
address = "DTddp5dRUfTYrrPjkdSxZqg1TkyEprbYhJpmNpLd8tSf"



# nft mint
[[test.validator.clone]]
address = "41jKeBpGH6Ur46r9fMc8JjyAbXitTB5BAdo7SGF82RoY"

# nft holder account
[[test.validator.clone]]
address = "7U1G1DJAm51evMyN6RM7SyRAkrfGEC7B2CBc4CYnQthE"



# nft metadata
[[test.validator.clone]]
address = "4cJ8hMuocWqJ8gmiviHEduv5X9EmagFPk5Uba16b4Zvh"

```

with this you'll be able to work with NFTs on localnet
Altight, then I'll try again tomorrow. Thanks for the hint
other devnets?
üôèüôèüôè
Hi everyone I need step how to add metadata to a spl-token
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71532545/how-to-freeze-an-spl-token
Today I came up for this question. Is this possible to freeze supply (seting mint authority to none) but allow transfers?
I think this might be a problem with the devnet outage
But possible 100% to run other devnets
I mean it is a bit different
Well there is testnet
Not really, this is my code. I am just trying to create a new account and I want the user to be payer for this:
try {
      // Test new account creation
      const newConnection = new Connection(network, opts.preflightCommitment);
      let newIndexAccount = Keypair.generate();
      const walletResponse = await window.solana.connect({ onlyIfTrusted: true });
      let instruction = SystemProgram.createAccount({
        fromPubkey: walletResponse.publicKey,
        lamports: 1 * web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
        newAccountPubkey: newIndexAccount.publicKey,
        programId: programID,
        space: 1000
      });
      let transaction = new Transaction().add(instruction);
      let blockhashStruct = await newConnection.getLatestBlockhash("finalized");
      transaction.recentBlockhash = blockhashStruct.blockhash;
      transaction.feePayer = walletResponse.publicKey;
      const signature = await window.solana.signAndSendTransaction(transaction);
      let result = await newConnection.confirmTransaction(signature);

    } catch (error) {
      console.log("Error in account creation: ", error);
    }

The first thing that I notice is that the estimated balance changes in Phantom is not correct.
When I approve the transaction anyways I get the following error:
{code: -32003, message: 'Transaction creation failed.'}

Am I missing something in the transaction creation?
Is there something I can add to the RPC API call on getblock to ignore vote transactions
genius
I was so confused why I wasn't getting anything from the devnet and now I'm relieved it's not just me
I wonder if it's possible for them to operate more than one devnet? devnet1, devnet2, etc.
Any ETA on Devnet?
yea its been about 16 + hours now according to status.solana

mm relatable, but you can run this test thingy locally
all i want to do is to play with my tokens
ive written as much pseudocode as i can just waiting to hit run button
been not working all day
Lmao so the tactic is to stop working for now?
Solid
doing normal life shit
we all in pain rn
it down bro
Anytime I try to get a airdrop on dev net the transaction fails any advice?
Shit sorry for tagging people
This is more of a typescript problem I am having, but it's with 2 solana related packages, <@223065599704563713>plex/js and <@893467316564676698>lana/spl-token, when I am importing something from <@893467316564676698>lana/spl-token the types of the version in <@223065599704563713>plex/js gets used even though I imported a git version locally (as I thought the 0.2.0 had the problem, but I have the same problem with the 0.2.0 version from npm), and the types are used from the old 0.1.8 version <@223065599704563713>plex/js uses
Resolved couple messages later, scroll down for the solution.
https://status.solana.com
The Devnet Twitter account doesn't mention the outage: https://twitter.com/SolanaDevnet
Also following. I know there's a devnet outage all weekend, and into today.
I'm running on Solana devnet. Awhile ago the devnet stopped allowing AWS IPs to run token transactions. A Solana communtiy manager suggested I switch to another RPC node: https://psytrbhymqlkfrhudd.dev.genesysgo.net:8899/

After the recent Solana devnet reboot a few days ago, I get the following error.

`solana airdrop 1
Requesting airdrop of 1 SOL
Error: airdrop request failed. This can happen when the rate limit is reached.
`
When I try to run the same command with devnet, I get:
`solana airdrop 1 --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
Requesting airdrop of 1 SOL
Error: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds`

Is there another RPC node I can try?
??
Can you explain a bit more? e.g this transaction - https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3FZbxjKFhiRozuPTqKu1N5iab11NkxVGCLdiu3uxW7FQd9B138x5Fb9Nb2K4HhPree7LQEiSHEGU74nX7qJhkqoA
deserialise the instruction data or parse the buy/sale tx for currency being transacted by the buyer to the seller
Anyone?
just add `features = ["cpi"]` to your `Cargo.toml` to enable CPI. you would import the program you will CPI to in your caller crate and reuse the accounts and data structs. https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/tutorials/tutorial-3.html#defining-a-puppet-program
given a program's anchor source, what's the go-to way to create instructions for it's functions from a rust client? the anchor lang book assumes a typescript client, but what about creating instructions for CPI, etc?

are devnet rpc servers down?
hunger only drives the motivation up and up üòÑ  but good news is that I just got off the phone with one of the other offsec blockchain engineers and they confirmed that, the vuln I found is the main one, and there is 2 more that spawn off/from it, and that this exercise was/is static analysis. So now I just have to write some exploit code in rust to show how the exploit could be automated. I'm relatively new to rust (programmed a guessing game & through it up on Github, but thats the extent of what I've done so far), I can just read and understand the functions and stuff. Developing exploit code IN Rust is a whole other thing entirely...So stumped at where to start....I asked if I could just do it in python & import a rustlang lib, but thats a no go, they want to see it done in rust its self.

Do you think it'd be doable with just a Rust rce/rci (remote code execution/injection) program? Or would it be more than just that?

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

That's happening way before you try to talk to solana (you're not even able to run your program)
Thanks will try this, appreciate it
i usually get that issue when i have insufficent fund ..
that did it
so eg if program costs 5 sol, put like 20 into the account
what worked for me at the time was stuffing my balance with sol
Did you find a solution?
how do I deploy anything in solana-program-library?
https://spl.solana.com/memo how do i deploy this? i built it but it has no steps on how to deploy
when i try get acccount info
i get this error: No such file or directory (os error 2)
Yep https://explorer.solana.com/address/9Z1GfDw61aQ6LFwaccEwbyBedzKaTKbNzVKvbJLyUHDb
i am still getting os error
I need help can anyone please help me verify if this is a token account 9Z1GfDw61aQ6LFwaccEwbyBedzKaTKbNzVKvbJLyUHDb
Yes, we'd been testing on devnet for sometime decided to push to mainnet today
and are u sure the wallet private key is correct ?
were you able to deploy it in the devnet  or testnet?
20 SOL
how much sol have you got in the wallet ?
weird, it says the token account not found
Error: Account allocation failed: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds
There was a problem deploying: Output { status: ExitStatus(unix_wait_status(256)), stdout: "", stderr: "" }.

mainnet
which cluster?
>spl-token account-info 9zv51PeTWxFPCJX9zVu3VHgoUDYmcKidsgcNQLZcdZ8Y'
yes
are you sure thats the token account?
i get same eero
even with 1
isnt it suppose to take only one token account as the argument ?
did u check if the blockhash isnt expired?
what might be the issue?

HI devs i am getting os error 2 when i run spl-token command
can you show the error image?
Can someone pls help w this?
We are getting this error while deploying an Anchor program in Solana Mainnet. All attempts are expiring after a long time with this message:

Error: Account allocation failed: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds

The authority account is already loaded with sufficient SOL
sweet. Thanks heaps bud.
yup
so when i create pool, i just create the pool with that mint address So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112. And when i add liquidity it should work then, isnt it?
and end up as SOL in your wallet
just treat the sol as a token with mint address So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112, it should work out
Hi I'm getting this error trying to deploy an update to my program on devnet, I've pushed a lot of updates since the initial deploy so I think it's because the original program account is out of space. I've read the way around this is to re-deploy with a new program id, but how do I do that? I'm not using anchor..
`Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 0: account data too small for instruction`
so when i add liquidity for pool, i need to convert those sol to wrap sol?
ohh i see..that makes sense. Thank you
you can treat wrapped SOL as a token and i believe this should automatically unwrap to SOL in your wallet
Hi, when creating pool for swap,  can I treat sol as token ? similar to if i have to swap two spl token from the pool?
Thanks a lot guys
awesome
it will let you subscribe to the account and automatically update those data, when there is any changes.
is that the same endpoint?
try using onaccountchange function
Ok, I think that'll help
oh really?
this is definitely possible
you can retrieve information on what wallets sent what amount
So I assume that checking wallet balance will not give me information about what addresses made these payments, right?
its definitely possible to manage a wallet from a nodeJS app. In terms of getting notifications the only way i can think to do this is to have your app checking the wallet balance every few minutes to look for changes.
I would suggest using jup.ag, pretty easy to use, https://docs.jup.ag/. We have swaps implemented on our discord bot MoonPup. You can test it out on the Space Vizlsa discord server.
Hey guys, I'd like to manage a solana wallet from a nodeJS app, and I'd like to know if it is possible to get notified when there was a transaction made to my address. Also, I'd need to know from what address this was made. Is this achievable from the Solana SDK?
How exactly do I use the solana spl-token swap?
I'm confused about how to setup swapping in my dapp. I'm looking at this: https://spl.solana.com/token-swap. Is there an existing liquidity pool i can point to in my app? I was also looking at using raydium but confused by their docs as well.
Does anyone have a recommendation for web3.js code to send token transactions with a high-degree of reliability? Using basic sendAndConfirmTransaction() i'm experiencing a fairly high amount of dropped transactions
Hi, when creating pool for swap,  can I treat sol as token ? similar to if i have to swap two spl token from the pool?
~~logSubscribe is still lossy when network is under stress, it can skip some txns, how did u combat that?~~
My bad, I realize u were actually asking why u were losing txns when using logSubscribe. I am facing the same problem too üòÇ
I am using a temporary fix by querying all txns slot by slot, inefficient but it ensures none of the txns are skipped
So its close to working (maybe)
Thank you very much for confirming.
Yeah, your intuition at any rate is correct that the write will eventually fail if you don't actually own the account
I see, yeah, makes sense. It definitely makes sense to check if you are reading something. Never should read from untrusted sources. But if you are writing then not obvious why should you check
Think that's just to give a nicer/custom error message
Hi! I have more like a "best practices" question:

https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/master/src/program-rust/src/lib.rs#L35

```
// The account must be owned by the program in order to modify its data
if account.owner != program_id {
...
```

The question is - why are we doing this check, if there will be another check just at the end of your entrypoint call? Just to save some CPU resources?
is solana mainnet congested? I am trying to sell an NFT through the metaplex storefront, tried several nodes, but they all give me timeouts
yes

Not sure about rust specifically though myself
or any other way but not cli
hey, is there any rust code to airdrop spl-tokens on specefic wallet address?
no problem at all. yeap, JavaScript is arguably a decent general purpose language to pick up these days as a first language, and the ecosystem is very active indeed. put in some work and you shouldn't have too many problems picking it up. when it comes to interacting with Solana, there are a lot of smart people active on this server and a lot of people will be able to answer your questions. üëç
Thank you for that response, I really appreciate it, so if my understanding is correct, on-chain will be in Rust, and off-chain in JavaScript/Typescript. 

I guess I‚Äôll be learning both, probably JavaScript first to get an understanding of programming, then go into Rust to get the smart contract side of things done. 

Will be a long journey, but I know I‚Äôll get there as I can see how great this community is and being a newbie, it is awesome to get helpful insight from you Devs and hopeful to get to your level one day and develop dApps alongside ‚ù§Ô∏è
as for the off-chain part of your "dApp" - you can use whatever programming technologies like, but you'll find a majority of people writing clients that talk to their on-chain programs in JavaScript and TypeScript, but there's nothing stopping you using something else.
the currently supported languages for Solana on-chain program development are Rust, C and C++. some people do write their on-chain programs in C or C++, but the majority of developers use Rust.
when it comes to development of applications without a blockchain ecosystem, you can think of there being on-chain software (known as "on-chain programs" in Solana, oftentimes called smart contracts in other blockchain ecosystems), and off-chain software.
But for blockchain development it is good to learn both for many aspects of a Dapp
JS has more request for jobs and absolutely easier than smart and power full rust, sometimes writing a similar code in rust takes 3x time than in JS
Sorry, coming from a newbie and wanting to get good at programming and contributing to the ecosystem
Hey all, I am new to programming, as I am wanting to get into development for Solana and its ecosystems, just wondering, I know it will be a long journey for a newbie, I know majority are written in Rust, but also seen it can be written in JS too? What is the best place to start?
Rent exemption is for 2 year
client.get_minimum_balance_for_rent_exemption(bytes_length)
Yes the function will give you that
i'm just trying to see if something is feasible or not üòÖ is there any easier way? I just need a very rough estimate

You have function for that
does anyone know where I can find the approximate rent rate for accounts (lamports/kb yr)?
Isnt solana native token?
Like serum order book swap?
thanks, ill look into it.
You can use serum
lmk if u find the answer to this please. swapping from sol to spl would give extrinsic value to tokens üôè

yeh no errors on devnet, rip
thanks I'm gonna quickly try it on devnet and then take a break
Not rude, just uninterested. However I know frustration can do that. Maybe take a break from it for a bit. Come back to it with fresh eyes. Shoot me a message after I get some sleep and we can peer program it
I keep thinking I've fixed it and then it breaks again
but you've helped me a lot so thx
but yeh been super frustrating
sorry if I came off as rude
I get it, it can be frustrating. However it's even harder when asking for help and you don't know half the information people would need to help resolve it
Personally I send the transaction with finalized. Then I log the signature for the transaction. Then I run confirm transaction in an exponential backoff.
I think I was originally but found the errors cryptic and unhelpful so I stopped bothering
I will try and replicate the errors and log it
I guess all I can say is that if you are seeing the transaction on solscan, then it returned a signature. Why you are not handling it correctly, I don't know. If it only happens on mainnet then let it run on main and do logging. Or better post the code so someone can see if something is overlooked
I mean it could be failing a preflight, however it wouldn't then secretly send anything.
but it seems to work perfectly there
well I wished it threw errors on devnet
What I am saying is you must be doing something wrong in your code. You say you are catching an error from it, but don't bother to log the error. I posted the function above, not sure what you could be catching.
okay so what you're saying is I can't trust the sendTransaction function?
No, that is succeeded.
that's secretly succeeded
a transaction shows up on solscan showing an spl token transfer
Define failed. You can't say it failed but secretly succeeded.
the transaction failed
I just assumed if it threw an error
not logging it

Like pulling teeth, what error.
which I catch
throws error
Define fails
some of the time it fails but secretly succeeds
most of the time it succeeds
And? What happens?
yes
So what does your code do? Do you await the send?
assuming defualts would be safest
I've left them as default
Hmm, I doubt its sendTransaction to be honest. Could be a code oversight on your part. How does yours look, you preFlighting?
so I've been having problems with double sending of transactions as a result
This is only a problem because the `connection.sendTransaction()` function seems to be the only way to get a newly created transaction's signature, but that function, god as my witness, seems to fail and NOT return a transaction hash, but still secretly succeeds in the background
Not much. I can't figure out how a transaction's hash is generated.
What progress have you made since the last time you asked? Not judging, just wondering.
Or something, good luck:
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/token/js/modules.html#createAssociatedTokenAccount
So just use createAssociatedTokenAccount which will give you the correct token account address to send to.
So I think, you are creating the instruction to create the account, however you then add it to the transaction. And below you are creating a transaction instruction for recieverAta, which isn't right.
How do I get a transaction's hash from a `@solana/web3.js`  `Transaction` object in string format (as used by e.g. solscan)? This does not appear to be working:
`transaction.signature.toString('base64')`
Thank you so much for your help
I will check
Ok for your code, get rid of 31-36. 
Use: createAssociatedTokenAccount instead of createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction
You will need to make adjustments. For mine it is already a fact that the receiver has a token account.
My brain stopped working. This should work. At least to get an idea. Good luck. Poke me in the morning, or someone smarter. My only advice really is to log everything, make sure you know whats going in and what should be coming out etc.
Got it, It's like 2am for me. So just do something like this
I did go through this function also, but I need the user to sign the transaction using his wallet, thats why I am first creating instruction and then sending it for signing !
Correct on line 23. 
Do you think this would work better?
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/token/js/modules.html#getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount
I think line 23 just returns associate token account address, then again in line 25 we need to check if any account exists on that address. If no account exists then need to create account with line 31
Ok, so line 22 is returning the token account for that, so we know it's working. Did you verify line 23?
Hi,
I wrote the following typescript code to wrap SOL.

```
import { NATIVE_MINT, AccountLayout, ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, Token } from "@solana/spl-token";

        const ixs: TransactionInstruction[] = [];
        const toAccount = await Token.getAssociatedTokenAddress(ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, NATIVE_MINT, this.keypair.publicKey, true);
        const info = await this.connection.getAccountInfo(toAccount);

        if (info === null) {
            ixs.push(Token.createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction(ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, NATIVE_MINT, toAccount, this.keypair.publicKey, this.keypair.publicKey));
        }
        ixs.push(Token.createSyncNativeInstruction(TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, toAccount));
        const tx = new Transaction().add(...ixs);
        const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(this.connection, tx, [this.keypair]);
```
The following error happens although TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID is specified.
Any idea?

```
  logs: [

Hey <@!916418166836568107> did you find solution to this ?
ok
I don't know JS
literally what that doc you're allegedly reading is about
what conditions need to be satisfied before a transactions signature becomes valid (client side)?
<@!585868308419444749> why does
`transaction.signature.toString('base64')` not work as an input to `connection.getSignatureStatus()` ?
you'll get there
reading it now lmao
did you read the document that you just linked?
didn't know that, how long does blockhash last?
why? the blockhash expires long before that
e.g.
"Before re-signing any transaction, it is very important to ensure that the initial transaction‚Äôs blockhash has expired"
however if you need to guarantee that the action/transaction your performing only happens once, then you need to put more effort into your retry logic
practically for my usecase which is not that sensitive, I don't care if I double send a transaction
I've set my timeout at 5 minutes

Can we extend this timeout?
When you send a request using the `Connection` object, it sets up a websocket and listens for the rpc node to tell it when the transaction has been confirmed. Sometimes it takes longer than 60 seconds for a transaction to get confirmed, but the `Connection` object gives up after 60 seconds.
Does anyone know when this happens?
I am getting this error: 
Transaction was not confirmed in 60.01 seconds. It is unknown if it succeeded or failed. Check signature 2C1Df4SRPN76jBEqcn8q7PkZyoguku3ua2HLdMAuDjtFsz6WZT6isbQyoWFuGf6QKA984VGbvgTWWiBB4MBUwXum using the Solana Explorer or CLI tools.",
Hello everyone
if your rpc node doesn't rate limit then I guess you could send as many as you want
you'll get rate limited by rpc nodes pretty fast sending transactions all at once. For my use case of bulk airdropping spl tokens, I found that sending each transaction 200ms apart works fairly well
any good solutions for sending+confirming multiple transactions in parallel?

clock sysvar has the slot
can I get current block height / slot number in smart contract rust?
there are some available by default. others may have created their own mappings for borsh.  for ones that do not exist you may have to look for implementations or look at the existing borsh handling and create your own for other types.  the borsh related communities and github have conversations on going as well.
also i'm assuming initing the connection is the same as initing an http rpc connection, but lmk if im wrong
`let pubsub_connection = PubsubClient::new(pubsub_url).await?;`

how exactly do you listen to a subscription, for example something simple like slots with `pubsub_connection.slot_subscribe()`?
thanks, i saw this, but i guess i can't specify `f32` or `f64` in my schemas as they're not available for Typescript... according to the Type Mappings as listed in the link you provided

hello! Is it possible to assign multiple authorities to a regular solana user account? I see that this is supported for stake accounts for validators, but it currently supports only one authority.

hi guys is it possible to update spl-token decimal
Hi, suppose I have created a token mint using spl-token-program, and then minted many to different accounts and now I want that for every transfer of my token, I get 10% commission. How can I achieve this ?
Thanks!
Not certain, but I dont believe so as it exists. Cancel is generally for longer running process which for on chain processing is not generally a thing? Building cancelation into the program may make more sense. May depend on the use case..
How to see the owner of a token?
Can you abort an RPC call?
Thankssss
is anyone working on it?
same
Just following up on this. I created a token for airdrops, 0 decimal. I transfer a few to a wallet. However they show up in NFT collections area of phantom, not the "currency" area. I try to send some and it doesn't ask for amount, so it will send all of them?
yeah, just deployed a contract, and the deployed timestamp be like `Timestamp:
about 19 hours ago
I mean the situation when a person does not even have to know about our contract, and we send our token to his account
Can tokens be sent to a specific pubkey address using a contract? ( I mean the situation where we have only pubkey as a variable)
At this moment my idea is to deserialize instruction depending on `program_id`. So I call get_transaction() RPC method and then "unwrap" a lot of enums into until `Parsedinstruction`(https://docs.rs/solana-transaction-status/latest/solana_transaction_status/parse_instruction/struct.ParsedInstruction.html). Do you know guys if there exist such Instruction structures or I need to create them myself?
Returned method in RPC rust client are very nested. Are there other ways to get transaction details?
why does my code work when I newly generate this keypair:
```ts
const state = anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();
```
but not when I assign it to an existing one?
```ts
const state = anchor.web3.Keypair.fromSecretKey(
  Uint8Array.from([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, myKeypair,..])
)
```
```            SystemProgram.transfer({
                fromPubkey: publicKey,
                toPubkey: new PublicKey("ADDRESS"),
                lamports: 1,
            })```
for more details see the "Usage" example on the readme page
is it possible to have such decentralised storage? or should the chain rely on file system links in cloud CDNs?
how do i store large files on solana block chain?
For now learning Rust, but our company has Solidity contracts, so it would be a much better development experience for us if we could re-write them in Solidity using our old ones for reference. Just manually re-writing though to handle cases that aren't 1:1 compatible (such as assembly)

I am getting a lot of blockhash not found errors on mainnet with the serum node, only sometimes my transactions are getting through

Does any1 know that?
yes, if there's an extended outage
is this something that we could expect ever on mainnet?
yeah
right, so what I said.  gotta wait until the network corrects the drift from being offline
It's like traveling back in time. I am in the past on devnet.
i really just need to be able to reference the current time onchain to compare it with a submitted timestamp. would be a simple block.timestamp in solidity
If I want to create a transaction in Web, how can I define the wallet it shall send the transaction to?
`Clock::slot` is the native representation of time on-chain, it stopped advancing when the devnet was down.  That can be used as an alternative in some cases but not all.  If you really need wallclock time, then there's nothing to do but wait until the time drift is corrected automatically
i will take a look thanks
There's two ways listed here https://solanacookbook.com/references/programs.html#how-to-get-clock-in-a-program
If you're interested in running a crank that updates a clock in a separate account, that is an option
Yeah I'm using this:
`let now = Clock::get().unwrap().unix_timestamp;`

what would be a good (more reliable) alternative for getting the current timestamp onchain?
I want to make a set of NFTs that allows users to access a game. How can I check that the user owns one of the specific NFTs that I will mint in order to gain access to the game?  I know I can use web3.js to get a list of their tokens, but how do I check they are the correct tokens?
if your programs are dependent on wallclock time, it's possibly time to consider an alternative approach as this is fragile in general
devnet time will correct itself over the next week or so. it's behind because devnet was not running for a couple days, and timestamp correction is done slowly.
i have not...just trying to update some accounts which have logic built in that controls the frequency.  and they keep failing saying that im trying to write too soon.  the current timestamp (external) is provided as input to the tx, if the blockchain thinks its still yesterday then it makes sense that they are failing....

yeah, did you notice that  time interval is 5 seconds?

No you're good, devnet had been having issues though. Check <#749059399875690557> for updates
which one am I suppose to used?
<@682066666175332362> https://api.devnet.solana.com/
<@682066666175332362> yes, it was a scam
What RPC are you using?
Don't DM anyone for support with devnet, likely a scam
Is this legit? Looks dodgy
i using web3 sdk
Can someone make a bot that auto responds to the word "devnet"

Literally the message above most of these questions is somebody else asking and then explaining about devnet üòÖ
Hi all 
i am getting the below exception. PLease someone let me know what exactly the issue and how to fix it?

/Transaction error:  Error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Attempt to load a program that does not exist

when devnet rpc nodes fixed? any news?
Where is "devnet-announcements" channel? I can't find it
just wanted to confirm something. I was looking through the source and it looks like the transaction only stores the signers public key. is this true?
I wanted to listen to magic eden auction house:
https://solscan.io/account/E8cU1WiRWjanGxmn96ewBgk9vPTcL6AEZ1t6F6fkgUWe

I thought I would get this data from the auction house smart contract: ListingReceipt, PurchaseReceipt, etc.
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/blob/master/auction-house/program/src/receipt/mod.rs

But I don't receive anything when I listen E8cU1WiRWjanGxmn96ewBgk9vPTcL6AEZ1t6F6fkgUWe with onProgramAccountChange.
I can listen to the logs though

However I can listen to this program (Magic Eden V2)
https://solscan.io/account/M2mx93ekt1fmXSVkTrUL9xVFHkmME8HTUi5Cyc5aF7K

I receive some accounts when I use onProgramAccountChange  but I don't understand the content, should I try to reverse engineer it, am I missing something
I just started on Solana, I might be missing something
when I listen to onProgramAccountChange how can I guess what the account contains ?
What do you mean? you mean we should wait more time until to reset the correct block time in the devnet?
No it‚Äôs out and probably won‚Äôt reset until the end of the epoch which is approx 36hrs away. Not 100% on how the time reset works though
Maybe I think it's different almost 23hrs
Currently, Devnet timestamp is incorrect
Hi, I'm still facing issue using devnet, any update on this? when the devnet will be available again?
is it again down ?
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":503,"message":"Service unavailable"},
see if it works for them
can someone run "solana config get"
its up
no way..

You are using Windows
You should be spinning up WSL and installing/using Solana from there
What is the fastest way to dump the tx history of my program (for further stats computing)
Program Accounts are data
Programs execute
However; no IO allowed in a program
You'd have to do the listening in client side and invoke program instructions accordingly
So, there is a constraint on the depth of invokes, which is 4
Other than that, the limiting factor will be ComputeUnit (CU) budget. 
For each invocation you are debitted 1000 CU
Then there is the CU consumed by your program and that which is being invoked
Depending on where you are targetting (local, devnet, testnet, mainnet-beta) you may add an increase to the default budget allocation: 
https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/runtime#transaction-wide-compute-budget
https://solanacookbook.com/guides/feature-parity-testing.html#facts
Yes, that's the addresses I need, thanks!!
IIRC it only returns the addresses you include in the `accounts` field yep
Hi, how can I listen to transactions from a program account ?
Is it possible with websockets
Oh I see, so I would have to change the accounts data to get their balance?
I think you'd need to check the current balance, then compare it with the balance returned by the simulate call
Yes but I couldn't find a way to see how the balances of specific accounts changes
is dev net started working ?
There's an RPC method to simulate a transaction: https://www.quicknode.com/docs/solana/simulateTransaction
Hey, I was wondering how does apps like Phantom Wallet simulate the balance changes right before you confirm a transaction. Anyone who can help?
anyone knows why
i want to create a custom token address but i cant do it
FML! TY for the heads up - You can report them in <#812122623654887444> and a mod will deal with it. BTW if you go to privacy settings for this server you can disable DMs, I strongly recommend doing that

hey guys how many invoke we can use in one function ?
like if i want to transfer token's to multiple address from smart contract how much invoke transfer method we can use ?
You can set `feePayer` for any transaction, but the fee payer has to be a signer so you'll have to sign the transaction as whichever account you're paying fees with before presenting it to the user
If yes, what's the abstract behind It? How should I do that
Possible to create a smart contract that pays for the Solana fees on the user behalf, covering every single expense and having users to actually only push the button?

how to integrate solana for multi signature functionality in wallet for transaction.
The clock is approx 1 day out so do we have to wait until the end of the epoch? ty
Is there an ETA on devnet timesync please? It's screwing with our time based contracts... https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet
aka is there a template where it could put all these arguments for me so i only put description?
are there any extensions for rust in vscode that formats code properly and also where i could add method comments that would auto create comment with arguments  instead of doing it manually?

example:
`// 
/// A small utility function that allows us to transfer funds out of the Escrow.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `user_sending` - Alice's account
/// * `user_sending` - Bob's account
/// * `mint_of_token_being_sent` - The mint of the token being held in escrow
/// * `escrow_wallet` - The escrow Token account
/// * `application_idx` - The primary key (timestamp) of the instance
/// * `state` - the application state public key (PDA)
/// * `state_bump` - the application state public key (PDA) bump
/// * `token_program` - the token program address
/// * `destination_wallet` - The public key of the destination address (where to send funds)
/// * `amount` - the amount of `mint_of_token_being_sent` that is sent from `escrow_wallet` to `destination_wallet`
///`
üòÜ Okay thank you!
no its up but seems to be getting random 503 errors
devnet still down?
I'm trying to use the command airdrop but says that I'm rate limited
I suppose there is always building from source üôÇ  not sure why Big Sur would be throwing that, unless your out of space, or some compatibility issue.
Is there any other function to get exact sol coin transfered?
getTransaction  functions, how to identify sol transfered. 
postBalances and preBalances fields contain multiple balances. The second one in the array looks like the sol transfered, will that be true in all case.
I might just uninstall completely and reinstall, but then I risk this failing and not even having the previous solana version rip
yeah bro I did
donnyyyyyy
primarily seen on some windows version. and dont recall it being mac related since long back.
did you try a different directory?  do you have an issue with a previous version?   I dont see this error being reported. had no issue. failed to iterate was generally something OS related or unable to operate within the folder for some reason.
Thanks
but i need it to work on the macos.
I tried on another machine running ubuntu 20.04.04 LTS, and it works
I know this is a common windows error, but I didn't get it before on macOS
Does anyone have any idea as to why this might be? Nothing on google or SO
I'm on macOS Big Sur with an AMD chip

Hi everyone, why am I seeing empty wallet? Any idea what am I doing wrong
i am also facing this error mate üò¶
does the new devnet changed the stack size? our program works on both mainnet and previous devnet but with the new devnet it now panics with `Program failed to complete: Access violation in stack frame 7 at address 0x2000075e0 of size 3080 by instruction #0` .  Reading from the error info it is also weird becuase the stack size (3080) is not reaching the 4kb limit yet.

oh my bad I should know this lol
Ah sorry - as far as i remember
damn so close... wdym by afair?
Should be all in the docs afair
Looks like it, but don't remember. I haven't done this tutorial in a while
I'm getting 
"Kong Error

response instead of "OK" on step 6. Do you or anyone know how to fix that? I don't understand how datahub and my code interact, am I supposed to put my API key somewhere or something?
Yo is the Metaplex Storefront Doc still working and is it still viable? I heard some devs say it's over engineered - whatever that means.  I'm about to dive into it.
yes the devnet blocktime will be wrong for a while, since the network was off.  It will correct itself using the method described at https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/bank-timestamp-correction#timestamp-correction
I faced the same issue, Does anyone else? ü•≤
could this because of the amount being lower than transaction fees or something?
(custom devnet cluster btw)

yeah I do
Are you having enough sol left in your wallet after sending it?
anyone?
not really. still rejecting my transactions XD
looks like DEVNET can push message now, but the block time is wrong
built from source, that fixed it

I just can't deploy with Solana version `1.9.17`
Hi, how could I check how many blocks the validator has synced ? I want to deploy a full node, so I try to check the progress of block syncing.
I'm getting the following error:
```Error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Transaction leaves an account with a lower balance than rent-exempt minimum```
What could the reason be? The account through which I'm transferring SOLs does have enough balance to transfer to a newly created wallet, so I wonder what might be going wrong here
I'm not able to deploy to devnet with the same error
Hi, I want to create a PDA account where my program can save some data with respect to a token mint
But I am getting 'Signature verification failed' error
What mistake am I doing ?
i have it working on the current version now... not sure whats up but at least its working
I reverted back to an old version of Solana I installed. 1.8.5 and I could deploy. I think it's my install. Recompiling on my M1 now with version 1.9.17 to see if that fixes it
And if I want later a token account so the program can store custom tokens, do I need to use the same keypair right? to create an ATA for that Account right?
So the purpose of the key is just sign the transaction to allow the program create an account for it, so the program become the authority of that Account.
Depends on if your program ever wants that keypair to sign again (so if you don't foresee asking for its signature, then it's probably fine to drop the secret key, solana itself won't ask for it)
since the account is owned by the program, is still the keypair needed?
What I don't get it yet is if the keypair is needed later? "const myAccount = anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();"

https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/tutorials/tutorial-1.html#creating-and-initializing-accounts
You pass a pubkey and sign the transaction so an account is created on the program side
I get it
took a snapshot
what is this block of code called?
and it looks like it requires a feepayer
I'm trying to just grab the estimated balance changes after a potential transaction without actually making the txn
do transaction simulations require sol to be spent?
I'm getting a similar error when trying to deploy to mainnet as well.... Long hang... then `Error: Custom: Invalid blockhash`

`Error: HTTP status server error (503 Service Unavailable) for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com/)`
I'm having issues deploying anything.... Anyone else having issues?
I know Solana is hungry for disk, it might choke when full
i have plenty
i installed prebuilt binaries
Have you checked disk space?
probably wasnt installed correctly
tried that üò¶
try with sudo
ü§î

pc or mac?
doesnt help
restart terminal
Found the solution! Was to run with ``sudo solana-test-validator --no-bpf-jit`` flag
```

tf?

Update: for those wondering, building from source instead fixed it

https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools#build-from-source
(using ``sudo solana-test-validator`` to run and seems to be running fine on the outside)
stuck finalizing any tx, including deploying programs so kinda stuck
been running into this issue on my new m1 mac recently when trying to do any tx on localnet ``solana-test-validator``
Oh well ^^
Maybe to have a fixed price (not based on usage) or higher speed as you can sit them right next to your application servers
Why is people want to create their own rpc ? I mean what are the advantages
I don't know the price, but I think it's with 256GB so look up what you can find with that
<@303390406979092482> this one also helps 
https://github.com/rpcpool/solana-rpc-ansible

I‚Äôm interested in this as well üòÉ
Want to provide all candy machines to our users for browsing and possible minting and this requires doing a large getProgramAccounts call on main net.  I‚Äôve found there‚Äôs no indexing on the cm_v2 program and so it seems like accountsDB may be the solution here.  Wondering how this setup goes though.  Been doing a bit of research on validator nodes and rpc servers but still feeling pretty unsavvy (idk if that‚Äôs a word).  Wondering if someone might be able to shed some light here on what exactly is required to populate this accountsDB setup.  Would we need to host our own instance of the blockchain to read data into our db?  Or maybe we can connect to a validator node somehow for reading data at some interval?
hey guys is it hard to create your own rpc, if so do you have any resources that could help?
does that create a transaction window prompt? or nah
like simulateTransaction?
without actually executing the transaction window?
Is there any way to grab the estimated balance changes that would occur from a txn
there tends to be more error information after that line, could could try calling the methods individually instead of using the wrapper though.
Thanks to the Solana dev team for fixing the devnet issue.
Can you guys deploy anything
How long is the block hash timeout for transactions?
Why is there no transaction count on status.solana.com?
anchor deploy ?
what was the deploy code?
ye
it will open you the file explorer
Any tips on getting better error/debug info out of a sendAndConfirmTransaction? I'm currently just getting `Error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: Program failed to complete`
lol
perform explorer.exe .
how do i file search on here lo
same ^^
im in wsl
you can search for the file manually if u forgot the right name ^^
delete them
or delete them
in the brackets
then anchor build again ^^
pase it in anchor.toml and lib.rs at the place u had old addresses
and copy the address it will give you

thats a dev wallet
as a test
send 0.5

I don't think there is. I loop over the signatures one by one
before i airdropped anything
i got rate limited
can u send me some?
looking like u have 217 dev sol
and it won't let me check the token address
ye same for me
on devnet
How come I can see two Solana in my wallet?
my balance won't update
Are there a way to call function similar to [getTransaction](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction) but with more than one signature at once?

the `{ commitment: "confirmed" }` part in the function was actually not there when I ran the tests initially
Hmmm
Not sure what that property is
because later you may need it in some examples ^^
Can it be the `undefined` you pass into the `createMint` method
Not sure what can cause this, sorry.
second half, when creating the token acc
Is it the first part of your snippet (`const mint....`) or the second (`const aTA....`)
Ok, so the mint is invalid
Showing the actual error is crucial

What errors are you getting?
am I using something incorrectly?

##REMINDER
Update your solana version with either
#$ sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.9.17/install)"
or
#$ solana-install update
```
Why all the examples include "pub system_program: Program<'info, System>", in fact there is tutorial that says doesn't know why he is including it, he just include it because everybody else is doing it
Thanks everybody for putting in the work to get it back up and running!
devnet is back ü•≥
Yeah, he is very funny but helps
seems to be a funny content creator ^^
i'll take a look ^^ i didnt understood everything but it's really hard x)
Believe it or not, this video helped me a lot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWZAXXygVOM
yeah, you are right. Also understanding PDA was a crazy thing haha
so it's one of the possible alts
there is no global variables in solana smart contract's so u can't use hashmaps or whatever mapping ^^
yes
yeah, and store it into the program account
haha while it works
oh u can make a vec of Pubkey
i'm trying to catch the idea behind that but my solution is to hardcode it i think ^^
so later I can validate?
Should I store the pubkey into an account?
Yeah, I am on it but I would like to know how a program can validate if the caller is authorized to do something, for example, release funds
thanks bro ^^
yo its up
try checking how account works => https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts
ethereum & solana are having really different archs ^^ that's all i can say to you u have to totally re-learn from zero to understand how it works and avoid trying to compare it to solidity contracts ^^ (it's hard i know)
In Solidity you have this idea to "store the owner" so you can validate later whatever you need. How is this translated to solana? does anybody have a tutorial about that?
alright ^^
is it possible using testnet as an alternative to devnet ? never tried testnet ^^
but we _do_ want weekends, so tradeoffs
i think that they're not wanting to have downtimes x)
Thanks !
Pls no downtime again cuz bored kek
Lfg
Thank you sir!!
got it upgraded using this build guide https://swaroopmaddu.medium.com/solana-installation-in-macbook-m1-b08582d50db1
develop it yourself if it is for testing purpose else it's not really fair ^^
Hey guys, does anyone know how I can get a discord mass dm bot?
ah- misread this. I didn't realize it wasn't up yet.
i were lucky enough to put some code updates while spamming with cmd x)
<#749059399875690557>
this channel is AMAZING
i've upgraded to 1.9.17
x) right
which was not long enough to bother mentioning
is devnet up and working? I can't airdrop a wallet
```Requesting airdrop of 1 SOL
Error: RPC request error: cluster version query failed: HTTP status server error (503 Service Unavailable) for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com/)```
only long enough for the bug to be triggered again
but it were on sometimes ^^
actually it went down saturday
idk what time is it for you but for me it is 23:48 ^^
devnet up just in time for happy hour..
u french ?
It's soon sleep time for me so probably won't get it done either way
yeah no worries üòÑ
it's gonna be soon just wait a lil bit ^^
So close to pushing out a new thing, just wanted to do some nice final testing on the devnet üòÑ
x) things that aren't only happening to other ppl ^^

TY for resurrecting devnet!
I'm a lucky man
Today started developing in Solana, today solana devnet go down xDD
oh kay x)
Yes, my answer is just more info about RPC is down xD
did you read the message you answered to ?
Error: RPC request error: cluster version query failed: HTTP status server error (503 Service Unavailable) for url (https://api.devnet.solana.com/)
Anybody know where the function to decode token account data is in the Solana explorer project (or any other project)?
I can find the reference to the front-end rendering in Solana Explorer but I'm losing the token account data in the state.
yeah some trillions sol are waiting to get transfered from devnet to mainnet ^^
and then it hit him.. he was never the same
you people write code with billions of value on it?
he said rpc infra is following so we have to wait ^^
holy shit they don't even read the active conversations
not working for me folks. Do we need to change something to connect? can I still use solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com?
could be more than one bug and it crashes again so, ya know temper your expectations
awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
x) fr
yes
don't my get my hopes up..  you know what getting me worked does to my system.. my heart can't take it
Niiice
Ah so just waiting for RPC infra to also be running?
devnet _is_ up.  RPC infra is following
it is still down (i'm waiting too x) )
you might need to wrap everything in your on() callback with try and see if promise chaining is not being caught
I still get 503 errors from the cli
shouldn't the devnet be up again by now?
That describes my issue perfectly haha -- using web3js to interact smart contract (remix) --> nodejs. I've tried to dig around for this issue but haven't found anyone else experiencing it
Thank you :)
yeh, really into the part about the `finality` commitment, and play around with sending txns and retrying with different levels of aggressiveness, and different retry approaches, depending upon optimization for speed vs avoiding transaction drops
I will look again thank you
It can be named as Items right
The name MyAccount doesn't have to be MyAccount it can also be Items for example?
what is this?  the issue you're describing is that the `.on()` event is not emitted.. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  without knowing more context, but look at the source code of whatever lib you're using to see if the underlying function emits different events
MyAccount is a global account not an user specific account
setting up my rosetta terminal now
But then a user is only able to see his own items? I want the items to be global so every use can see and add items or remove items to that item list
Any help would be so immensely appreciated
Gonna ask this one one more time ;p

Was wondering if anyone else has had this problem:

var option = {from:App.handler}
await App.contracts.MyContract.methods.test_method(testVariable).send(option)
    .on('receipt',(receipt)=>
        {
          if(receipt.status)
          {
            console.log("success");
            console.log("code snippet A goes here");
          }}).on('error',(err)=>
        {
                console.log("failure");
            console.log("code snippet B goes here");
        
          })

console.log("code snippet C goes here");


(app.js code for my Dapp)

When this smart contract interaction goes through (without speeding it up with metamask) -- it always works and I get either success or failure based on the result and it continues through execution to where I have code snippet C.

HOWEVER

If I speed up a transaction and replace the gas price with something higher than when I initially accept the transaction -- even though it goes through and gets recorded on the blockchain and in my smart contract, neither code snippet A, B or C runs. It's like a promise that never resolves? Unsure what to do about this. I've tried taking out the await and wrapping it another promise / another function but nothing works. It completely ends code execution.
create an account for your contract => ```rs
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize)]
pub struct Item {
  pub organisation: String,
}
#[account]
pub struct MyAccount {
  pub items: Vec<Item>,
}``` initialize it with ```rs
  let my_account = &mut ctx.accounts.my_account;
  let temp = Item {
    organisation: "test".to_string(),
  };
  my_account.items.push(temp);

```  You can put it in a function like ```rs
    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result <()> {
        let my_account = &mut ctx.accounts.my_account;
        let temp = Item {
        organisation: "test".to_string(),
        };
        my_account.items.push(temp);
        Ok(())
    }// u will need this to work (context)
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = user, space = 10240)]
    pub my_account: Account<'info, MyAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```
did you see the part where they describe mango's approach?
I think we need to retry the blockhash check rather than the send
You're welcome!
Thanks!   We use most of the standard public URIs, and we avoid getting throttled.   But "invalid blockhash" is high,  maybe 50%.    I did look at the cookbook but didn't find quote what we were looking good for other than  increasing maxretries  which helped a little but not a ton
Thx üôèüèª
I‚Äôll check them

I need to download it and print it as a book. Since I don‚Äôt always have access to the internet and the laptop
I want to have a list of items where a user can remove an item and add an item. But I don't know how I should define that. Because in my case rn every user will have its own list of items but I want that list to be universal for every user logging in on my dapp. How should I go about doing something like that?
There's all kinds !
I ran it right from the default installed terminal program on Ubuntu
Hi guys, I am new here and I want to learn more about solana and how to build and develop on top of it. 

Is their any pdf formatted document üìÑ of the doc ?
seeding exploits..   üëÄ
why are u guys writing release.solona?
and you used `sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solona.com/v1.9.17/install)"`? did you have to run it from a rosetta terminal?
<--ubuntu user, I thought Mac used the same command
yes
what does your connection look like for submitting txns?  solana cookbook has some good content explaining retrying transactions..   you might need to try a variety of techniques, specific to your needs
are you on an M1?
'unexpected syntax'
Sorry to interrupt whatever that was
i had to..  i'm human ü§°
Any suggestions for exchanges on how to have the best uptime for withdraws during network congestion?

We get a lot of "invalid blockhash" errors.    Does running your own node help or not really?

We always check for the blockhash first.    I am not sure if there is a preferred method of "retrying" etc
don't marginalize & invalidate the solana attracted persons community..
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solona.com/v1.9.17/install)"
Ya'll are making devnet restart take longer by asking üò≠
did solana make a deal with the easter bunny?  ehh?  is this deep state at play
we need our dopamine of seeing devnet txns
I ran the original install command and modified the version to fit

how do I update to 1.9.17? `solana-install update` only gets me to 1.9.16
Restarting since two hours ago xD
<#749059399875690557>
Of course
Is the dev test net still down?
send token to  wallet not show an nft because I need in send token has metadata show nft in wallet
<#749059399875690557>
hello, is the devnet still down ?
https://github.com/jacobcreech/Token-Creator
For example this token

Hi everyone Hos has an idea about method ADD METADATA TO SPL-TOKEN
collect the wallets + amount and airdrop?
What's the next step after getting that information?
Okay. I've taken snapshots in the past.
snapshot
Is there an easy way to do this all at once?
For example, a project pays out 1 solana per nft you hold.
How do projects pay out spl tokens/solana based on a certain amount of nfts you hold?
nice, I'll try that once devnet is up again. Cheers mate
yeah, i used the other method:
```js
const signedTransaction = await wallet.signTransaction(transaction);
const res = await connection.sendRawTransaction(signedTransaction.serialize())```
I have a doubt, I have hired a developer to make a token in Solana and he asks me if I want the token to belong to one wallet or several wallets to have access to it. For it to be decentralized or something like that he told me, what do you recommend?   And the same for other secondary nfts that I‚Äôll have
But there are assets available for v1.9.x
Same, I'm planning on making one for my family
So there no assets released for Windows from v1. 10.x onwards
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases
Pumped to create these tokens and do fun things with them
Would love to! Sent you a fr. haha. 

Like that personal connection and able to reach out and say hi and check in when I can
There's also examples with the CLI or JS here: https://spl.solana.com/token#example-creating-your-own-fungible-token
I'm new too, and I have created a few tokens on the devnet if you would like to learn together
random question: why aren't there any spl tokens on Solana that are used to track real-life assets? Like, why can't I buy an SPL token that's pinned to the price of commodities like a barrel of oil, or an ounce of gold? It feels like it would be pretty simple: just spin up some oracles tracking the price of the commodity on chain, then rely on existing arbitragers to keep the peg as close to the price as possible. But the fact that no one has done it yet makes me think its more complicated.

Any big problem I'm not seeing?
I appreciate that. Just don't want to overdo the chat with questions but makes sense üôÇ
I prefer to help people in the public channels TBH, it gives the opportunity to help others too :)
Happy to send sol for your time
I have pretty much the same code as you and get the same error. I was only testing it using devnet though (also before the outage I think). Did you get it resolved on mainnet?
I sent you a fr. Mind if I reach out?
I'm just getting started with Solana development. So I'm stuck as to where to get started. This will be my first 'project'. üôÇ Thanks üëç
Sure, so you can remove the other. üëç
I did it in 2 because I did not see this one
No need to spam your question in several channels
Are you using web3.js or the CLI? Where are you getting stuck/what error are you getting?

It's covered in the cookbook: https://solanacookbook.com/references/token.html#how-to-create-a-new-token

I also have a heavily commented example script here: https://github.com/pointer-gg/solana-pay-tutorial/blob/5-coupon/scripts/create-coupon.js
anyone here that knows how I know the name of my workspace?
I'm trying this  anchor.workspace.Noname but its the wrong workspace
Has anyone created SPL tokens ? Kinda stuck
understood fam, thanks for the heads up def appreciate it
dam. no way....bro thats crazy, so is there a way to prevent this or update this keys?
just be careful mane
sry id help more but im super busy and not on ur clock ya know
just giving u a heads up
also the % of course
the dude who makes ur candymachine is going to need a keypair to create the candymachine
aka the wallet that makes the money and has full control over the nfts

that's a requirement there's no way to not give him they wallet

if ur mint is gucci and ur funds are fine
he can stiiiiiill change stuff/do whatever
he has not mentioned any of that yet, only asked for royalty wallets and minding funds wallet
there's no way to change the keys later? so basically he will have access to our royalty wallets?
wait what? for what? lol dam I didnt know this part fam
when he makes the candymachine they're going to need the keys so just be careful
is that cool? safe?
he only got addresses to setup royalties etc.
but I got all the wallet keys
we have a developer working on our candy machine/minting site right now
yeah dude
be careful who has your candymachine wallet keys
if they seem off/strange do noooot give them ur candymachine keys
bc they basically have control over ur NFTs for life
thank you so much for the input fam! üôèüèª
developer just dropped random wallet so we were curious lol
got it. Thank you so much for input. We werent sure since we thought wed pay Solana directly
probably like 1.9 sol
but you get that money back after ur mint
how much is funding for SOL mint machine
someone charging 2 SOL for 1,111 collection.....any input greatly appreciated!
solana devnet is working now?
What's best practice for creating SPL tokens then airdropping ?
Will halt to adhere to strict +1hr for every person who asks without reading chatlog
it's being restarted ATM
Thank you
Ahhh okay okay
Has anyone seen this error before ?? ^^
I am trying to airdrop SOL on the local dev by running this command

solana airdrop 2

But the error that I am getting is :

Error: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds
devnet is down, they just restarted it like 10 min ago, it should be working soon
devnet is down. no current eta.
Any experienced developers active? Have a few questions if you're up for it
Is devnet down?
hey fam good day, i need to extend my current CM v2 collection to add burning mechanism, and in order to do so i would like to create a new collection which requires 1 NFT + certain token amounts to be minted.

is there a walkaround i could do this with metaplex?, or i have to go on a custom contract?, if so, could any of you be kind enough to pint me some repo to get inspired please üôå 

thank you very much in advance frens
Hey guys I own several discord services and I know a couple developers that are willing to start a project with me. We intend to use solana pay in order to create invoices generated through discord bots to sell such services. Also we plan on providing this service to other service groups and have clients interested. Is there anyone I should contact to start? I myself have zero development background and am looking for resources along with those to collaborate with. (Sorry for double message in general lol please dm if you would like to learn more about the project we will be making and outreach that we have)
:sad:
Does anyone know when the devnet will be back up ?
if this is correct for 2 SOL
for the funding of the contract, about 1100 NFTS....just wanted an idea
getting charged 2 SOL for candy machine, is this right?
Good afternoon!
Okay. I'd try that. Thank you
hey what is the approx time till devnet is back up?
Do you have any idea what could've gone wrong?
I'm trying to airdrop solana on devnet but get this: Error: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds
Hi everyone
You should try this question in metaplex server if you haven't already they might be able to help you out
`solana balance -k  .config/solana/devnet.json`
It shows the same balance that I'd get with `solanace balance` , i.e 150 SOL
ts-node ~/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts upload \
    -e devnet \
    -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json \
    
this would be the command that you'd be using, right?
can you do `solana balance -k  .config/solana/devnet.json ` just to check it's balance! 
or whatever keypair your passing in that -k flag!
yup
you're setting up the candy machine using the CLI?
Ig 1 to 2 sols should be enough for uploading, but even after dropping 150 sols, I'm still getting the same error üòï
i don't think it has anything to with the config file! i faced the same error only when my wallet didn't have any sol in it! After airdropping this error was removed!

yeah 
that's the downside of it
I downloaded Solanacookbook.com and now it is available to me offline by poking around chrome
autocompounder sounds obviously a lot more heavy-handed
1200 hours maybe? I knew nothing about solana programs and it took me about a week to build a simple token swap using Anchor
but knowing solana, the book would be outdated a week later kek
would be nice innit? but no afaik...wouldn't be a bad idea to start compiling information (downloading the website)
Hi folks. I'd like to build a simple autocompounder for Solana. 2 questions
1) would it be possible for someone new to build an autocompounder in 1200 hours?
2) is it even possible to build an autocompounder on top of another protocol (assuming open source) if solana smart contracts have to specify in advance all the accounts they interact with, so they wouldn't have the foresight to add the account id of my autocompounder?
is their any file or book i can download other than the solana doc on the website

i need a file that contains all the information
May I ask when will the voting for tx_wide_compute_cap start on mainnet?
Thanks! Probably i have to look for program(smart contract) on solscan, related to mobile in-app marketplace of Stepn
I use the solana web3.js lib
All marketplaces use a program (or smart contract in ETH speak) so theoretically you could pull all recent transactions for that program and look at what‚Äôs been listed, if you want to making a listings bot for example
I suggest you look at some of the listings on ME or Solanart, go to the token on solscan, and study the transaction structure
NFT is just an SPL token with a max supply of 1. To get the floor price you‚Äôd need to know which marketplace you‚Äôre polling and what the price is, which you can fetch from the listing transaction
let me try
Hi, guys! Jest started learning solana. Have a question: there is this project Stepn with NFT's on Solana. Is there any API to get floor price of those NFT's? Don't undestand where to dig, as i don't understand what **actually is** NFT on Solana
it means you don't have enough funds for the whole deployment process
tried 1.9.17?
I am using  the same solana 1.8.14
Now I am using 0.24.2
and anchor version ?
For me deploying was successful when I use solana 1.8.14
@Everyone
serum discord: 
https://discord.gg/xG5tSAnq
anyone know how i can distinguish between fresh nft mints and normal transactions when reading from the blockchain
What other way can I go about for this? Would https://docs.rs/serum-swap/latest/serum_swap/ work?
I need a way to programmatically do swaps on the serum DEX. I have spent hours trying to get their typescript @project-serum/serum/swap to work but it's a lost cause. Many many issues incl. signature verification failed on their own example.
Thanks for all the help!
Dumb me. I saw that in docs and completely forgot.

https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
Btw, how can I find out if the transaction was a success or failed?
That‚Äôs what came to my mind. Kinda wanted to avoid doing that.
and only add if it hasn't been added before
You can check for if the message already exists in your array
Hmm. I don‚Äôt get it, why am I even getting duplicates.
It works properly but it just sends the result as soon as it has been processed(there needs to be 32 confirmations for the block to be finalized)
I will have to store all the tx‚Äôs to remove duplicates. Is there any better way?
I'm not sure why you are getting duplicate messages, so I would just remove the duplicates as an easy solution
Does it not work properly yet?
Is there any way so that I don‚Äôt get duplicate message?
yeah looks good, you could try removing duplicate messages
I don‚Äôt think so. Tested using the exact same code - 
```js
const { clusterApiUrl, Connection, PublicKey } = require('@solana/web3.js');

(async () => {
    const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl('mainnet-beta'), {
        commitment: 'finalized',
        wsEndpoint: 'ws://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com'
    });

    connection.onLogs(new PublicKey('M2mx93ekt1fmXSVkTrUL9xVFHkmME8HTUi5Cyc5aF7K'), async (log) => {
        console.log(log.signature);
    }, 'finalized');
})();```
that sounds like an issue with your code
If I use finalized on both connection and on logs declarations, I sometimes get multiple logs for the same tx.
you can set it to `processed` to get a faster result but it could potentially be unreliable
It's dependent on the confirmation level and the congestion of the network, if you choose `finalized` which is the default configuration it's usually around 30s
I‚Äôm on it.
I just wanted to know the max time/ideal time a transaction needs to get finished.
I would log the api response and see what's wrong there
Not sure yet. Just started testing live.
do the tests pass if you wait longer?
Hi!
I'm trying to find user stake accounts.
Can someone help me to create ```getParsedProgramAccounts```  request with filter params? 

I have this params 
```const filterParams = {
    filters: [{ memcmp: { bytes: userAddress, offset: 8 } }, { dataSize: 165 }],
  };```
where userAddress - user pubkey (string);
I'm not sure about offset and dataSize


I get empty array after request, could someone help me?
Yes. The code passes all other checks and stops on those lines.
does the tx exist?
What is the best wait time before I fetch data of a transaction got from `onLogs()`?
Currently i have set 1 min so that the script fetch‚Äôs data of the tx after 1 mins. But most of the times seems `<Transaction>.meta.postTokenBalances[0].mint` or `<Transaction>.meta.postTokenBalances[0].owner` is undefined (attached screenshot). What should I do?

I‚Äôm using `confirmed` commitment btw.
I know trying it now.
Look, I don't have any issue retrying. It'd just be nice to get to a stage where 14/15 transactions aren't failing, or something like `getProgramAccounts` isn't accidentally nuked destroying half the ecosystem. Development on Solana has been a bumpy road.
Very easy to use google to understand the issue https://solanacookbook.com/guides/retrying-transactions.html#facts
Yes and blockhash not found is a prominent recurrent issue on multiple rpcs atm
This is not even the correct channel for this noise. This is for developer support.
it's noise. stop
not useless, i'd just like solana to work one of these days
please refrain from posting useless screenshots

i answered the question as asked.
rip solana
Recommend asking questions on stackoverflow. Indexed by google, and will be linked to a duplicate question if you asked a second time
tried sry. Might've just been blind x.x
You could always try googling it. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71939350/api-for-tps-and-other-cluster-stats
So i was thinking if there was a open api somewhere for "chain info" <@585868308419444749>
I mean they also have it on explorer.solana.com
huh?
prolly magic eden devs
Does anyone know where Magic eden pulls tps value from the network?
authors of whatever program declares the instruction, probably
Does someone know what this error means?

`Error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x10005d3`

`custom program error: 0x10005d3`
thank you for this!!!!!
https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list/pull/25556
Any idea why this fails?
testnet is pooping rn
It's only being used in the first deployment process to sign the last transaction
Once you have deployed the program to devnet, testnet and mainnet, I don't see any reason to keep it secret.
As best I can tell, upgrade authority is with the program's funder by default
Possibly a dumb question: does the private key in the keypair json generated by `cargo build-bpf` need to be protected as a secret? Is it ever actually used to sign anything when the program is deployed via `solana program deploy [path to adjacent .so file]`

Is there no way to withdraw a candymachine anymore?  Looks like devnet and quicknode have blocked the withdraw call.  Anyone know a work around? "The RPC call or parameters have been disabled."
is it possible to listen to a program id with a websocket and does anybody know where i could find more info about that?
Hey, is it possible to set block time for local validator from javascript?
We have some instruction and we want them to run after a specific time, what could be possible ways to write test flows for them!

Hi! How can find user stake accounts when user connected his wallet (using front end JS)?
For example like on https://www.socean.fi/app/stake in section "Stake accounts"
you should ask to the program owner or check the program is upgradable or not.
?
Anchor calls it the "account discriminator". Anchor wants to ensure that it never accidentally deserializes a `struct Foo` account as a `struct Bar`, so it uses 8 extra bytes of account storage to write down "I'm supposed to be a Foo".
in other words, they choose a bunch of cloud providers to store the NFT images under the hood?
Thanks for confirming! What do u mean by this thought 'also its account also take first 8 bytes as an account descriptor' ?
I think it depends on you.like metaplex, they don't put NFT image on chain directly. or if you want to make a completely on chain program, you can just store it on chain.
if a program is written by anchor, the first 8 bytes of instruction data will be a `hash(function name)` as an function selector. also its account also take first 8 bytes as an ~~account descriptor~~ account discriminator
Hey guys, trying to understand how to decode instruction data using borsh / python. I can see that the solana explorer can decode the tx 5Zu9LKxPNqAXBAjatLQgYNHPfud6E9zetE6bdRATwHNtCYPVfV4xUXnJyeq7G5Zosx9JQ1aPx65k4GkWFsrwNXTY successfully but I cannot when following the tutorials online:

```
import borsh
from borsh import types

dict_schema = borsh.schema({
    "escrowPaymentBump": types.u8,
    "amount": types.u64,
})
borsh.deserialize(dict_schema, bytes.fromhex("f223c68952e1f2b6fe00d088c310000000"))
```

But removing the first 8 bytes from the instruction data works

```
borsh.deserialize(dict_schema, bytes.fromhex("fe00d088c310000000"))
```

Any clues to why this is the case ?
dunno which to choose
either arweave or multiple transactions?
Price will always be available on Program logs for `Buy, Sell, List`?
if you want account data in an on-chain program, you can take a look at https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L44
you can't use RPC in a program directly
I see
if you want to retrieve SOL back, you need to close it
do I have to close it?
https://solanacookbook.com/references/token.html#how-to-close-token-accounts
solana account stores a byte array. technically you can put anything into it if you can transfer something into a byte array. A video sounds like a large file, it will be a cost also there is a 10mb limitation in an account. I think use something like arweave or IPFS will more suitable for a large file atm.
https://docs.rs/solana-client/latest/solana_client/rpc_client/struct.RpcClient.html#method.get_account_data
I have find this will it work?
I think you can get current owner, and fetch parse his tx history to know who send it to him. then do the same thing again and again.
I'm not sure if I want to close the token account completely, but I guess I could
Someone in my community accidentally sent solana to our token address (like as if it was an account). Is there any way to claim some of it back?
can i upload a video directly into solana blockchain or do i need to use cloud providers?
yes just remember use a same function. for now there are two functions can derive PDA, 1. createProgramAddress and 2. findProgramAddress.
and findProgramAddress is based on createProgramAddress but add bump seed for you.
ideally you will get the same result from those two function if your seed and program are the same
Ok thank you. 
Any idea on where I should look if I want to retrace the ownership of a NFT?
Then I would be able to query the PDA only with the seeds and program ID even though it was derived with a bump seed?
you can't get account data by RPC in program but you can just pass the account into your program so that you can get the data.
maybe https://solanacookbook.com/guides/account-maps.html#deriving-pdas
can anyone tell me how can i make a wallet object from its private key which is not an array?
you mean findProgramAddress? findProgramAddress is more like you give seed and it will add a extra byte in the end of your seed. it calculates from 255 ~ 0 and return the first match. (off curve)
I don't think this API has the guarantee you describing.
how can I get account data through RPC in program?
üòê
Like let's say my program derived a PDA on a certain user. Now I want to modify that account. How would my program identify that PDA?
<@788215642070581289>
Like wouldn't there be a difference between a PDA derived using bump=20 and bump=250
But what if it was derived using a bump seed? Would it still be mapped to the seeds only?
For the getTokenLargestAccounts, yes I figured this. Just want to know if the list of the reported accounts is sorted from the more recent owner to the older owner
Thank you for the TX. Any hint to easily track the different moves of an NFT across wallets?
a tx is composed by instructions. SOL transfer, token transfer, create account ... all of them are instructions. a tx in Solana will more like a fee payer and other accounts. not like ethereum has a from and a to.

about NFT question. normally NFT's supply is 1. so you can get the owner via getTokenLargestAccounts.
a PDA is derived by [seed + program id]. you can use different seeds to derive a different PDA.
Is there anyone here who can help with a token-list PR merge? 
It‚Äôs approved by the creator and now not getting feedback since 19+ days. Initially opened the PR 30+ days ago
Hey everyone,
Sorry for posting the question again, I think the one that can help didn't see them.

Can someone explain how from connection.getTransaction I can find the from and to wallet address please? (using `@solana/web3.js`) Please?
Also for an NFT, does `getTokenLargestAccounts` returns the wallets in the order of the ownership?
there are so much frequent 503 errors coming randomly on devnet üòê
Could the same program derive different PDAs on a user?
i get this error when tryign to deploy....

Is there any explanation to `onLogs()` sending same tx data twice when tracking a specific wallet? Is it because I‚Äôm using `'finalized'` commitment?
Should I use `'confirmed'` instead of `'finalized'` so that I don‚Äôt get duplicate logs?

Take this as an opportunity to exercise your error paths!  Or perhaps educate yourself on the mechanism whereby the network keeps time so that you can understand why your bitching doesn‚Äôt accomplish anything: https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/966197240441999370
Ok but that doesn't help me so I'm not relaxed. And things like this chip away at faith in Solana. It's the devs that build stuff and when they can't they get pissed. Time for more unhappy path coding then. Glad this didn't make it past devnet is all.
the time will catch up over the next week or so, you just need to relax
So another day and the devnet is approx 24hrs behind. Can anyone explain when the timesync will be fixed so we can continue development? Has anyone seen an official update on ETA or what the issue was and when it will get fixed and more importantly a 5 whys so it doesn't happen again?? No pinned message or anything. Yeah I'm shading and I know shit happens but no comms ain't cool from Solana...

Probably a better question for the Metaplex Discord
are there guides on customizing the candy-machine-ui ?
regards to sockets questions, most of the general socket design and implementation details apply. for public sockets there is likely no guarantee nor should there be an expectation that these stay open. private providers might offer a more stable or premium service for sockets, but no one should expect to have 100% solid connection in regards to any public sockets, especially high frequency ones.   if your familiar with socket handling, especially public use, all the tricks basically need to be deployed for design management and socket handling, and or using private services may be more beneficial and reliable. These tricks and design can all be googled and is par for the socket course in high freq use public domain. 

that being said, there are some potential incoming updates to improve on various socket implementations in the future the will hopefully help out a lot.  other providers are also looking at offering data up in different and potentially more accessible ways.
how to decode intsruction data received from json encoding to look like jsonParsed encoding?
The `onLogs()` sometimes logs the data and most of the times doesn't log anything at all. What am I doing wrong? Here is the code - ```js
const { clusterApiUrl, Connection, PublicKey } = require('@solana/web3.js');

(async () => {
    const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl('mainnet-beta'), {
        commitment: 'finalized',
        wsEndpoint: 'ws://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com'
    });

    connection.onLogs(new PublicKey('M2mx93ekt1fmXSVkTrUL9xVFHkmME8HTUi5Cyc5aF7K'), async (log) => {
        console.log(log.signature);
    }, 'finalized');
})();```

Is it necessary to unSubscribe from an event?
What happens when the code is force stoped?

I‚Äôm making a account tracking discord bot. Should I create all onLogs for all the wallets at once or with a gap in each subscription?
I assumed this meant you redid everything native.  which route did you go?  -good point mv.
what does the account `EBDRoayCDDUvDgCimta45ajQeXbexv7aKqJubruqpyvu` do in mango txs? it's not in their `ids.json`
that's what i wanted to know ^^ thanks so i have to bear the thing with an other idea x)
You can store data things encrypted, but anyone can download the data (accounts are public)
(what i mean by my account is -> the account created in my smart contract)
yes into my account i have a vec of a struct i created and i have in it a u8 that i need to keep private ^^
oof, just use the native solana tools on m1, they've worked fine since late last Fall
they are definitely doing some expanding, but base58 decoding then looking at the first byte gets me all I need for now
On-chain you mean?
hey is it possible to store an int but kind of privately (nobody or people that have access only could see it) ?
I get base58 encoded strings that are very short, unless the website is somehow expanding it...
If I am looking at something like https://explorer.solana.com/tx/zge7DLv9PHhMwGThV7CbWGQpvwxhqgrA2CGaMeWVyPjmsYHx3Tj4wg2JCZYi9jAqEomu1utunT9DWSpYC83ZKjy, how do I get that `Instruction Data (JSON`) that the website shows?

in either case, make sure the connection object your using from the client is pointing to the correct address and network.  if the program you are trying to call is not actually deployed to that network or does not exist (same), the program will not be found.

My validator is running on http://127.0.0.1:8899 and my connection in react is set to http://localhost:8899

    &destination_token_account.key,
    &source_token_account_holder.key,

    token_transfer_amount,
)?;   In my program I ma creating the account before this transfer instruction, then I used the instruction_creater.program_id but it gives error IcorrectProgramId
I thought I may have misunderstood the return of getAssociatedTokenAddress, but on reading the docs, it seems correct
It appears as though getAssociatedTokenAddress is returning the incorrect tokenAddress, which is resulting in an error when trying to transfer. Do I have to pull the ATA in a different way, such as getProgramAccounts with a filter?

See below for code and outputs:
Correct ATA is: 6xcxXmQKA4p9n3WVW8Rf2Z7kc2RaskPSjeudn7JdXxfD

Try this. I've just found it at Stack Overflow. It can works but not with public RPC's.
For example: first candy machine of 128 items, with a specific collection name. After, another candy machine of 256 items, same collection name. Then 512 items etc
Unfortunately I cannot find many info about this in the docs, maybe I'm just a noob
Hello, question: can I make a verified collection after minting? I plan to do this: first, make a first candy machine with a small number of NFT, then, make others with the same collection name increasing the number. If I keep the collection name always the same, and I sign them after mint, will I get, in the end, a unique verifiable collection that will show up as a single thing in secondary markets?

Thanks for your reply sir. I thought so‚Ä¶
Is it possible to stake 10 NFTs in one transaction?
What
I feel like there's an implicit assumption here around relations between the 10k that you should clearly express to get a good answer. Also, I'd wager metaplex is probably the better discord to ask this in, because I bet the Collections specification is going to be one of the possible things you should research to understand your strategy here.

Caveat that I deferred implementing the Metaplex Collections specification myself at this time (for the derivative avatar NFT from today's Everseed Elixir sale), as it seems either unsupported on mainnet-beta at this time or at least has no community integrations yet (e.g. Solscan, Phantom, what have you). But I could be out of date on that as the ecosystem moves very quickly.
I don‚Äôt believe so
Why would this be impossible?
hi guys, is it possible to firstly deploy like 500 NFT'S and after lets say, month deploy another 9500 ? Or that's technically impossible?
Hi guys,

Pretty timely! I was just wondering what the best channel would be to _post_ announcements about JavaScript infrastructure üôÇ

Let me run it by some folks and figure out where to put that / what to call it.
lol sounds like a browser thing? try a diff browser
it only lets me register if its the recommended password
this is odd its not letting me sign up
Yeah that would be nice to keep track of all the minted nfts
you can see all the uploads and what not
plus its easy to manage
üëç
I would hope the site would do better than 1000 monthly transactions so yeah I think ill go with pinata!
damn so 1000 transactions and its equal to pinatas monthly?
approx 2 cents usd?
because my idea is big one so I would need scale and paying pinata would be better
for a json i think it was like
oof im not sure because I use the script metaplex uses to upload
Nice do you know what airweave fee is?
https://docs.pinata.cloud/api-pinning/pin-json <@761040494369046579>
yeah pinata does for sure
checking it out, I would need to host it on the fly tho, I know airweave has an api does pinata?
with pinata, it's monthly
just keep in mind, arweave you pay a small fee once and its hosted forever
https://www.pinata.cloud/
I've recently seen others use this <@761040494369046579>
does anyone know how anchor account validation work? i have 
```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(
        owner = "MarBmsSgKXdrN1egZf5sqe1TMai9K1rChYNDJgjq7aD".parse().unwrap()
    )]
    marinade_state: Account<'info, marinade::State>,
}
```
passing `8szGkuLTAux9XMgZ2vtY39jVSowEcpBfFfD8hXSEqdGC` to it fails with `The given account is owned by a different program than expected'`
i've seen others just host on AWS
then you upload, etc etc
which requires you to have arweave tokens
https://arweave.medium.com/permanent-nft-storage-on-the-arweave-network-41f38d700a2d
the norm is to use arweave
sorry if thats a dumb question lol ive never done it before
Tuff, how do I host a json?
yeah what Donny said
you need to pass the account key to the program to get the balance. you cannot query an API or get a token balance otherwise from on chain without the account. Oracles are not for this and work differently and for different purpose. It is the nature of the stateless design.
neg the uri is the manifest, which needs to be hosted, can't be local
What do you mean?
one last thing sorry to keep bothering u XD but for the uri I can just use a local json right?
you need to feed it everything you're gonna use
unfortunately in solana you have to be extra explicit when it comes to program accounts and accounts in general
Wow yup errors gone ur a hero bro üò≠
you would need to pass in the token account
I mean the situation when we have only pubkey
Lool yeah lemme delete it thats super dumb
that fixed it for me
you can honestly just nuke the one inside
its dumb but it defaults to that
I mean the situation when we have only pubkey
you should see <@893467316564676698>lana/spl-token INSIDE of @metaplex
@metaplex
yeah
go to node modules dir
oh i had this same issue
it should be fine tho because the spl was just for testing purposes just wondering

üò¨
It just stops letting me export items
what do you mean by stop working?
hmmm
as simple as that
```rust
pub x_token_account: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
```
```rust
        // Assert the amount is equal to user's full token amount.
        let amount = ctx.accounts.x_token_account.amount;
        msg!("Found {} ROPE in user's account", amount);
```

ofc
Is it possible to check how much a particular user has of our spl_token?
I'm talking about a solution inside a contract. For example some Oracle or something similar (I want it to be possible from the contract)
Im getting the weirdest error üò≠ for some reason whenever I use metaplex `@solana/spl-token` just stops working
lemme try that
Ah ight thx
then do `metaplex.actions.mintNFT(...)`
I'd probably just import metaplex from metaplex/js
ah you're looking for actions.mintNFT
import {mintNFT} from '@metaplex/js'
yeah its not letting me import mintNFT
just make sure you're on the latest version
i personally used mintNFT from the original lib and it works
xD
pick your poison
they say that about all of their libs

but
yeah I saw that

seems a lot more legible
just an fyi
but yeah
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/js-next
like i also mentioned, metaplex told me to use their `js-next` lib, so you can also look at this
yeeeeee
Yep, metadata alr gened just needed a way to mint thanks soooo much ‚ù§Ô∏è
for best standards on building your manifest/metadata
https://docs.phantom.app/best-practices/tokens/on-chain-metadata
make sure you also read this
yee
Yeah this will work thanks so much <33
there's a few examples on Anchor I believe
Ight thanks!
you can do that
ye~
Could I just pass in the users wallet?
```js
const { Wallet } = require('@project-serum/anchor')
```
sec
for that I use project serum wallet
yeah it's gonna ask you for wallet argument
Been breaking my head over this for like 4 hours now
thank you üôè
üçª
Holy shit ur jesus my guy
I just import this method
https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/js/blob/main/src/actions/mintNFT.ts
this guy

Heh
kek
wait I just found it
haha documentation? on solana?
Intresting do you know where the documentation is? I cant find it anywhere
the borky thing is that there's no easy way to get stuff onto arweave atm without arweave tokens so i recommend looking at the metaplex web repo to see how they do it
I believe they've advised me to use `js-next` lib though
their `actions` dir has a few useful things, including `mintNFT`
check out `@metaplex/js`
yes this makes me happy

if that doesnt work id recommend just using a temporary solution and using the faucet
I definitely used to be able to airdrop 2 until a few days ago‚Ä¶
Ok I believe ur only allowed to airdrop 1
Yeah
thats how it should be
solana airdrop 1 <RECIPIENT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
you are putting the address in right?
Though the same thing happens if I try run `anchor deploy` (for Anchor projects)
It's literally just me running `solana airdrop 2 --url devnet` in the Terminal
can I see the code?
```

Does anyone know how to mint only 1 nft on the fly?
I just want to view all the nfts a given wallet has.
I‚Äôm not sure but I think this will be the program id `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`.
```js
console.log(await conn.getTokenAccountsByOwner(wallet, { programId: wallet }));
```
Can I see your code?
still not working for some reason
I put programId to the wallet that iw ant to get the tokens from.
Here is some info -
Yep
I know this isn't python that error is from ``@solana/web3.js`` not my code.
This isn‚Äôt python so you need to `filter.includes(‚Äúmint‚Äù)` instead
Devnet is down?
What should I put for mint and programId?
I didn't have a filter.
how do I use the system_program as an AccountInfo type?
Yeah seeing the code would be helpful
Where did you define filter? Please show your code.
Yeah it should return null if there are no tokens
why doesn't it just return ``false`` if there are no tokens tho
i have a ton of tokens
yes i used nfteyz to view all the nfts
Whatever the `filter` is, it‚Äôs undefined. That‚Äôs what the error says.
Does ur wallet have a token in it? Try and add a token and see if the response is the same
``getTokenAccountsByOwner()``
Which method are u using
check amount*
Is it possible to use how much token a user has on his account with only pubkey? (From a contract) (e.g. Oracle)
This would mean there are no mints on this wallet?
<@761040494369046579>

scroll down on the bar on the right and u should find "How to fetch and display token holdings"
this should help
I assume u mean SPL tokens, https://spl.solana.com/token#how-to-fetch-and-display-token-holdings
How can I access the nfts a wallet owns specifically the mint tokens?
Yeah I just fixed it thank you.
`new PublicKey('your key here')`
import `PublicKey` type from solana web3
public key is the wallet address
Well not knowing much about ur project I suppose you could do something like make a vault where you create one staking wallet and then on a button press have a transaction that sends the stakers nft to wallet and then save the NFTs address in the DB as well. So for example Staker A and Nft A. Staker A wants to stake his NFT so he clicks the button and you send NFT A to your own wallet and save the NFT address to the DB in addition to Staker A's wallet and when staking started
Thanks a lot! But how would you build the staking platform / vault itself?
So for using ``<new Connection()>.getAccountInfo()`` I need a ``PublicKey`` how do I get a PublicKey for a wallet I want to get information on?
Anchor has made it really easy
i still don't know much about rust
nope, python/js nerd
Hi. I'm using the community Go SDK to build a simple project. I'm using the Go SDK example for transferring sol from one wallet to another. The code is here: https://github.com/gagliardetto/solana-go#transfer-sol-from-one-wallet-to-another-wallet

As you can see, that code includes an airdrop request for the originator account so it has funds to transfer to the destination. That said, if you try to run that code with a brand new wallet, the transfer will fail - unless you wait a minute or so. My question is: **how can I guarantee order between operations when using off-chain software?** The `recent_blockhash` doesn't work for this, does it? Thanks in advance
I suppose you could do something like save the address that are staked in a database as well as when they started staking and that way u can know which addresses are staked and how long they have been staked for
Hi, Im trying to mint and send a singular nft, does anyone have any resources I can see?

`solana feature status`  on the per network feature status. no eta that I am aware of.
whats the status of the address lookup table feature? is that something we can expect soon?
I was gonna downgrade to this. üëçüèΩ
that would be useful with 0.1.8 version
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70224185/how-to-transfer-custom-spl-token-by-solana-web3-js-and-solana-sol-wallet-ad
try 0.1.8
Especially because the instructions I want to call are pretty basic
Which version are you using before? I should probably downgrade as well.
It ll works, I m working with spl-token since 6 months and the older version with Token construction works fine. Never got any error, today is the first day I get trouble with the new 0.2 version
can anyone help me please?
Hello, while transfering tokens from one account to another, I am trying to add fee_payer in the transaction itself, but it is charging me 0.00001 for transaction. when I am proceeding with a single signer in token transfer instruction  it is costing me 0.000005, but the problem here is I want to have another account as fee_payer while transfering the token and want the transfer cost to be 0.000005 only.
maybe creating a stackoverflow topic if i dont fix this issue by today
What if we downgrade to an older version?
Same here.
not working but thanks for the help, so strange comportment as I look into the spl-token src folder and there is the getorcreateassociatedtokenaccount function
Bad idea. Didn't work for me
<@!178602642077908992>
Wanna try this üëá ?

`import { getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount } from '@solana/spl-token/lib/esm/index.mjs';`
`Module '"@solana/spl-token"' has no exported member 'getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount'.` nobody knows how to fix that ?
btw i believe this cmd https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/tokens#distribute-spl-tokens is broken from the latest getLatestBlockHash change. Everytime I run it seems like its working then just fails with 'Invalid blockhash' I think its coming from the RPC client module but not sure. Maybe i need to update tho, current version:
```
solana-tokens -V    
solana-tokens 1.9.1 (src:b66e2ae3; feat:4100269022)
```
For example, all token accounts are owned by the spl token program; only the spl token program can mutate their data. If I want to send some of "my" tokens to you then, I need to ask the spl token program to please do that mutation (nothing else can)‚Äînamely, decrement my token account's balance and also increment your token account's balance. The spl token program is written in such a way that it will only agree to do this if I sign the transaction with my wallet's secret key.
Program accounts are just accounts that happen to be marked as executable. Every account in solana has a "program owner", and only that program is allowed to modify the account's data or decrement the account's lamports. The idea of user ownership is something higher level: a program could be implemented in such a way that it will only agree to mutate an account's data if someone signs the transaction.
check <#560174212967432193> <#837340113067049050> better suited question there
<@!270368441972555776> thanks for your help it finally worked! everything looked to be correct already... but what matters is it's working now. Much appreciated.
i know the accounts programming model can be confusing for some lol
right yea some details are definitely missing, but feel free to add anything additional to address the question
E.g. you can have a token account (owned by the spl token program) that lives at one of your own program's PDAs‚Äîthat doesn't mean you can modify the account
PDAness is actually totally distinct from whether the program can modify the data at that address
Excuse me, how to setup my RPC nodes? Is it the same as validators?
You can update via `solana config set --url devnet`
the RPC URL
RPC URL: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
run `solana account` and double check your info
for the network, I assume you're referring to websocket URL?
I am. I just created the wallet and sent funds to it, also using the CLI, so it should be pointing at the correct one -- which I just confirmed with config get
also make sure youre on the correct network
are u using CLI? if so make sure when your run `solana config get` the keypair is pointing to the correct wallet that has funds
I think its ok here
Complete noob here, so I apologize for dumb questions or if this isn't the right place to ask. I'm just trying to create a token for fun and educational purposes but I keep getting an error "unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds" even though I have .05 SOL in the wallet.
I could go on a bit more but basic idea
Theres a few missing concepts here. Programs can only interact with accounts that are either marked mutable or program derived accounts (addresses off the curve that the program has control over and can modify or access data). For example when you interact with a program, you are interracting with multiple programs that have access to do different things with the accounts passed int. Think of the System Token Program as ERC20 basically defines functionality and how transactions with an SPL token works. Your wallet is your own data, you are the sole owner of the keys so everytime you interact with SPL tokens you are actually creating Associated Token Accounts that own the data of that SPL token but only u have access to
Thanks
look up simulate transaction method
Hi, I am building a dApp with `solana/web3.js` and I want to implement tests, I wonder if there is any documentation/example on how to test these apps. Good practices for unit testing say that you should always mock your responses, but in case that I want to do End-to-End testing, submitting transactions doesn't seem right to me, unless somehow I could clean that up from the Solana network. What recommendations do you may have when testing against Solana clusters. I would appreciate it if you can point me to some sample code, however, I am pretty sure that any little help counts. Thank you!
If im right u doesnt need a program cuz it's very simple to check: simply ask the user to connect his wallet (solana adapter wallet), then get all the mint he has on his wallet, then check if one of these mint has benefits
getTokenAccount of the connected wallet, verify the SPL token is the correct NFT, unlock site
Yeah, BAYC has this on their website
like if a member on ur website has an specific NFT he ll have benefits ?
I've been digging into solana recently and still dont have a clear understanding of why there are program accounts and data account. I thought at first a data account was owned by a user (personal wallet) and a program account with executable code was used to modify data owned by a user. But if the owner is the program account, what's the point? and how does a user have ownership of there data
I want to use an NFT to unlock access to member benefits
Hello dev, is there a program which gives NFTs access to backstage things ?
Thanks!
but with that u have an idea of what it looks
Researches are ongoing for 0.2.0
this code was working with the last version
`Token.createTransferInstruction(
                TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
                fromTokenAccount.address,
                toTokenAccount.address,
                fromPublicKey,
                [],
                1
            )`
Yes it is
Will try this.
and then send the transaction to the user wallet to be approved
Thanks!
Is it mandatory to create a new associated token account for the user before transferring to them?
Then add an spl-transfer instruction
The basic steps to send an NFT is to: -getOrCreateAccount for the sender and receiver
Are they by default rent-exempt? This wasn't addressed in teh cookbook
Do you have any idea about what to do for the associated token accounts for example?
Coolio.
You're right and that's not corresponding to the documentation about 0.2.0, im doing researches
Oh. I just installed the `"@solana/spl-token": "^0.2.0",` version and it seems to export the `Token` class though? I guess the `createTransferCheckedInstruction` is a static member of the `Token` class
`Module '"@solana/spl-token"' has no exported member 'createTransferCheckedInstruction'.`
Hey, I got this error while importing some function from the new version of spl-token (0.2.0). Dont know why, in my package.json spl-token ^0.2.0 is well installed
BE careful with the new 0.2.0 version Token class isnt avaiable
https://solanacookbook.com/references/token.html#what-do-i-need-to-get-started-with-spl-tokens lot of helps here to understand how to transfer an nft with spl
Hey everyone. I'm looking for some examples on how to transfer an NFT from one user to another in Solana using the `@solana/spl-token` package.

My understanding is:
1. Before transfering the NFT to the new address, I need to create an Associated Token for the recipient. (Is this account automatically rent-exempt? If not, what is the right way to make it rent exempt?
2. Transfer token using the `Token.createTransferCheckedInstruction`.
Forgot crucial thing: "only the owning program itself can do that". Thank you for reminder.
The only way to write data into those accounts would be by asking the program to do it, so the program ultimately is the only thing that can write data
You can indeed create those accounts, but you *can't* write data into them‚Äîonly the owning program itself can do that
Hi! We have a method `solana_sdk::system_instruction::create_account_with_seed` for creating an account that takes 7 params two of which are `pubkey` and `program_id`. Upon a successful invocation we create a new account with `pubkey`  as account's public key, and owner with `program_id` (also a public key of a, say, my official program). Since `program_id` is a public information any one can craft a transaction for creating  account whose owner is `program_id`. So, I can create thousand of accounts whose owner is `program_id` and write into that account anything I want. If I'm, say, a company who created that program, then anyone can compromise me (at least harm by creating unnecessary accounts pointing to my program id). Or do I miss something?
Ahh, so the user signs all the CPIs that my contract will call, if they sign my the transaction to my contract?
actually the user don't sign for some specific CPI, the user sign all transaction.
so here https://github.com/jarry-xiao/solana-bootcamp-lectures/blob/master/lecture_3/tracker/count_tracker/src/processor.rs#L43
is the user, in your client you will pass it as isSigner: true
and he need to sign the tx
cc <@!851464725257912340>
Hi! Stuck probably a trivial question -
How is the user signing this transaction - https://github.com/jarry-xiao/solana-bootcamp-lectures/blob/master/lecture_3/tracker/count_tracker/src/processor.rs#L57 ? user is the one paying for the rent on the tracker_ai pda, but I'm unable to understand where exactly the user signed this CPI to allow a debit from its account
thanks.. can you please provide me with an example for serialization of a token account ?
curious on this as well
Is anyone else seeing it? Any solution
We are seeing a lot of these errors on Mainnet: 
Error: Transaction was not confirmed in 30.00 seconds. It is unknown if it succeeded or failed.
Thanks a lot! literal hero
Yeah, ultimately there needs to be an actual token account at the address you're trying to send to, so you may need to create one yourself. When in doubt about which address to use though, that's what "associated token addresses" are for: they're program-derived addresses derived from the associated token program, with (pseudocode) seeds = [the owner, the mint].
When transfering an SPL token or nft-token to a wallet, when you need to define the token-address to send it to, do you need to create a new token-account for it when you are sending it or what token-account should you reference as the "send-to" account? (this would be from the frontend)
So, what is the Program that owns that account? SPL Token? Once you know the program you can go look at their source code to determine how to deserialize
it is an account.... any tips?

{"mint":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,191,216,175,173,51,19,165,234,223,61,151,229,131,111,154,182,75,154,149,128,184,123,25,132,156,142,41,68,95,118,176]},"owner":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,15,202,92,108,205,94,222,135,136,235,223,68,117,100,240,251,236,102,200,89,24,176,209,142,244,58,245,128,90,206,50]},"amount":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},"delegateOption":0,"delegate":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},"state":1,"isNativeOption":0,"isNative":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},"delegatedAmount":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},"closeAuthorityOption":0,"closeAuthority":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}}
Depends, is that an account's data? Is the account owned by a Program? How does the program serialize the data to the account? When you know those you can deserialize the buffer
You would need to read through the contract's source though to figure out why/which `has_one = ...` constraint is failing.
0x7d1 = 2001, so it's most likely this anchor error: https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/blob/master/lang/src/error.rs#L49
this may be a bit far out to ask, anyone knows why a program might fail with custom program error 0x7d1?
When running a transaction, cant really find any reference to the error
I made test transfer on phantom and all keys are identical (source,desti... etc) but why phantom succeed but calling it in javasciprt using the example in the URL fails? ü§î
Not dm
In the group
Say me something
If you can help me
Hi people
So, using the example in the URL throws `invalid account data for instruction` if you try to send USDC between different wallets?
Is there docs how to transfer, say, USDC from wallet to wallet? Seems like this is for if you transfer to the same owner? https://yihau.github.io/solana-web3-demo/tour/token-transfer.html
got a new one!
AccountOwnedByWrongProgram. Error Number: 3007. Error Message: The given account is owned by a different program than expected.
u mean the problem is the issue of my ssl config,right? i am sorry for that,i am a ungraduated student. haven't studied further...
i feel like my mistake is insanely dumb and i just don't see it
still nothing, even after all the re-configuration
have you installed using this method before?
generally things like this are SSL, config issues, proxy / VPN issues, IPV/Network related issues. but generally some kind of setup/config->mac related issue.  may want to google the error. 
also, for smaller portions use text or link to text.  images are not great here.
that might be it
i think my baseAccount doesn't have permissions yo
but still nothing
re-built my contract, cause i hardcoded the pubkey into the smart contract. lol
yeah, i dropped my id.json and generated a new key
as far as i know.
afaik?
i have considered this question,but it still doesn't work...
unless otherwise handled you can only init an account once afaik. but yea can try. lots of anchor related items are very specific to anchor.
something with your ssl may be not installed?  try updating or getting the SSL package
maybe simple re-build and re-deploy with a new account will help?
kay, cool)
not that I am aware of.  data can be different from different accounts as well.
probably need to check the anchor docs and discord on this
hey.. how do i parse this to a number in ts?

{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}
Can i know why it doesn't work for me?
While I can see lots of information of an account in the solana explorer, I cant download the accounts data there. Is there a website for that?
i get my base account from secret. key (from id.json)
hey, can't seem to understand why i can't sign this transaction. i always get 0x0. init method is available only for admin (wallet.PubKey = baseAccount.PubKey), so it should sign, right?
don't want to buy a 4k machine and then discover I can't ship anything lol
cool, thx for confirming
yeah. I think it also works fine to me. I just deployed a program on devnet and mainnet haha
oh I meant more as a smart contract dev - so deploying/upgrading programs, other dev solana-cli commands
if you are taking about validator stuff, I'm not pretty sure.
if you just use cli to send some SOL or token transaction, it works fine to me
thinking of transitioning at some point
btw is solana working on m1 fully ok?
yeah no I meant mac as in apple mac, you got it right
I'm not on m1 - for some reason airdrop command is always really weird for me, eg the vpn issue above used to cause problems on devnet
I use m1 mac too. not sure what happen on your side. maybe try 1.9.14
oh you mean mac sorry
dunno
I had problems with VPN being on in the past, but it's off rn
probably a mac issue then
sounds weird. I installed 1.9.13 and I think it work fine to me.
1.9.13, no error, simply stuck "finalizing transaction" even with small amounts, eg 1 sol
what's the error ? also would like to know which version you used
base58 can't use an alphabet `O`
the allow character list is `123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz`
guys 

solana-keygen grind --starts-with O:1

Above command gives below error. Any solution ?

error: Invalid value for '--starts-with <PREFIX:COUNT>...': O: InvalidCharacter { character: 'O', index: 0 }
anyone else having trouble with airdrops on `solana-test-validator` (ie localhost)?
Hey lovely Solana community, please help me with this problem.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71723456/how-to-deploy-a-solana-program-from-a-particular-address-or-public-key
yes
If an instruction in a transaction returns an error, will Solana revert the entire transaction?
so to clarify, is the `getProgramAccounts` call going away long term? what's the closest alternative we should be using?
Ok cool Thank you üôÇ
Yeah, not sure why the installer didn't work for me. I'm in a rush so I just did it that way. Works fine you just have to add the path envs yourself if you want those
<@!182296047052259338>  Gotcha, So that is the install from source instructions? I will give that a go. Thank you!
Yeah, I just went to:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/tag/v1.9.14
Then downloaded:
solana-release-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.bz2
Then unzipped with 7z twice to get the solana folder.
Then you can place that somewhere and setup a path var. 
Or just CD to it and run the commands inside
should have specified
yeah sorry
Solana cli?
is anyone else having issued downloading the windows installer?
how can I help write upgrade guides with all the breaking changes?
upgrade the prgram
write a handler to close the account and refund the sol
plz help someone expert

if i have an account that is attached to another program that is not the token program, can i move SOL from this account without using the program? (i have the private key)
breaking changes are becoming more of a pain to deal with
Mint and RawMint were swapped in some version of the spl-token lib
why do we have a mix of BigInt and BN in our libraries?
for now will have to deal with the existing limitations. if you really need that much you may need to wait on some features or figure out a way to break things up and still accomplish what your looking to do.
Would it be possible to build an on chain program that takes smaller transactions and puts them in a big one? Or is that not possible?
ok awesome, I really appreciate the response. It is a lot of accounts, although I should really dig into these and see if there is any more efficient way these can be constructed. But was just wondering in general if there way anything I could do without having to put a lot more effort in.

Alright thanks again, really appreciate it!
its impossible to know if there is a way to optimize without links to relevant code.  and not something everyone is accustomed to.  generally you would have to break it up or figure out how to optimize. several updates are under way to help out with many issues regarding size or budget of certain things, but in some cases it will just have to be broken up. if its too many accounts eventual address map updates look to address that, for cpu budget there is another to address that.  `solana feature status` to see the latest on the relevant network and its activation status.  and the feature id/description to search for more detail.
you should be able to fix the lint issues and try again.  it may have seemed obvious to a maintainer that it was pending on your end potentially without being more specific. see if you can get it resolved by looking at the details.  everyone is incredible busy, but if you give effort and keep persistent as with most things it should yield some results.
Im sure this is a stupid question, but I was just wondering if anyone had a solution for this, but I am pretty sure this just isn't something that can be done, just wanted someone to confirm my suspicion. (Please be nice to me I am new to blockchain in general) So my transaction is too large (1525-1650 depending on certain things). Is there any way to 'compress' this, or is it just simply not possible to stick all this in one transaction if it is consistently slightly too large? 

And if this is not possible, is there a way I can make multiple transactions atomic?
Thanks for the response! I will try that out. I did add a comment to the PR, however it's going on a month and nothing. So just wanted to see if I was missing something obvious
generally click on the details by the failed steps and you can learn more.  its possible at times it has nothing to do with the PR itself, but when the rules were run, some conditions on the back end were not met for whatever reason.  its generally better to put comments in the PR/Issue and work to get it resolved there.
in your case the linter found 2 issues, and the node one is either related or the server process just failed when running. either way the 1 appears to be on your end? and something potentially simple. if not resolvable try the above.
Ok, maybe not exactly the right place, however can someone please tell me what I am missing with this PR?
What else needs to be done? I'm not really fluent with the checks that are failing
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/23511
you may want to look at the wallet adapter issues or search on the error in walletadapter github and discord.  if it does not exist and you have some reproduceable error you could file an issue
Resolve your issue?
You can use borsh, yeah (it's the default with anchor)
Is using `solana_program::program_pack::Pack` de facto standard for serialisation and deserialisation? Can we use borsh crate instead?
Reposting, if anyone has an idea
Think of two big numbers S and P. The rules of the keys are the following:
- Knowing P, you can derive S
- Knowing a message signed with S, you can derive P
- There are no ways of deriving S from P
what is the test Automated market maker so i can provide liquidity to tokens?
The term "wallet" doesn't really make any technical sense, it's an user term. In reality, all there is is secret and public keys. To prove that the person pretending to own a secret key, we have to check that they're able to sign a message with that key.
noob web3js question

why most apps do request the user's signature to prove they own their wallet? if a user connects their wallet isn't it proof they own it?
When parsing transactions (in JS). Whats the best way to determine which token a `transfer` is for? `transferChecked` has the `mint` property but a `transfer` does not.
Is it possible to determine the validator executing a program instruction at runtime?
I'm currently trying to mint tokens on demand for new users on my platform, and creating multisig accounts for them on demand. I get a long delay when creating the multisig and was wondering how long on average the wait time is for the rpc call to return with a result

Is it possible for a solana program to get a program account that's not coming from the input public key ?
Awesome response, thanks!
Oh my.... I was not using the connection I thought I'm using. I was sure as hell it has something to do with my accounts and was totally blind for more simple solutions, only confirmed the connection by eye, the first time I stdout the connection it was fallback to devnet, pfff. Thanks a lot for your help and <@!409036697813123073> as well, thanks!
Hello all! I am new to this and I am trying to build a simple ui that display a token mint address and the amount of such token, I am using getParsedAccountProgram to get the info but I just have no idea why it won't work and I am just smashing my head on the keyboard lol, Does anyone know why it doesn't work? here is what I have at the moment: https://github.com/jdaniel96/BalanceAndMintUI/blob/master/src/InfoRequest.tsx (I don't know if there's an easier way to do it)
I have checked it and the dest address is the same as the one I'm sending
phantom wallet will use your wallet as a fee payer to init the dest token address if it doesn't exist. you can take a look at the transaction
Sorry if this is the wrong channel: Following up on <https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/24094>. Do  log subscriptions with mentions actually work?
Since sending USDC from phantom using the same addresses works, its kinda odd why does that function fails? At first I was sure the issue is something to do with the destination address but I'm literally out of ideas now

how to fix?
Hi, I am looking for a Solana's developer to talk for a possible work about "monitoring energy via proof of stake/similar". If someone fits, please DM me
I wanted to be super clear what I'm sending. SOL transfers has no issues on mainnet, only the token transfers fails üò©
genesysgo RPC on mainnet
or are you using a correct connection?
BTW, this part
```
    {
      publicKey: new PublicKey("FROM_ACCOUNT_WALLET_ADDRESS"),
      secretKey: 'FROM_WALLET_SECRET'
    },
```
can use these method https://solanacookbook.com/references/keypairs-and-wallets.html#keypairs-and-wallets to recover a keypair object
and `FROM_ACCOUNT_USDC_ADDRESS` owner address is the `FROM_ACCOUNT_WALLET_ADDRESS` in the explorer as well
Confirmed using solscan and explorer, both of those ends up to the correct token account
ok. I just want to check are `FROM_ACCOUNT_USDC_ADDRESS` and `TO_ACCOUNT_USDC_ADDRESS` valid token accounts.
On mainnet, I would not like to dox, though üòü
if these account are existing on devnet or mainnet, could you share them here?
Hello! I have a question. I just realized how stupid I am. I want to develop a program that will do something specific on an NFT. But before sending the NFT, I do a lot of client side checks with Web3. And if the NFT passes all the checks, then it is sent to the program. Except I forgot that anyone can use the program, and therefore literally override all the checks. So I have no idea how to secure my program. Do you have an idea? Also this check can't be done from my program, because it requires external off-chain tools, and since there is no Oracles, it's not possible. I'm glad I realized how stupid I was before I deployed the whole thing, now I hope I can fix it
I get it, and from/to addresses are correct USDC addresses for those wallets. Confirmed also from successful phantom transaction, everything is identical
https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction
invalid account data normally happen when you try to use a non-token account to send/receive token.
you should init your from and to as a token account.
also different mint need different token account to hold
a USDC token account will be different with a SRM token account
To make this super clear, does this look correct to you?

```javascript
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

//building the token transaction
let transaction = new web3.Transaction().add(
  splToken.Token.createTransferInstruction(
    splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
    new PublicKey("FROM_ACCOUNT_USDC_ADDRESS"), //token account pubKey object
    new PublicKey("TO_ACCOUNT_USDC_ADDRESS"), // to token account pubKey object
    new PublicKey("FROM_ACCOUNT_WALLET_ADDRESS"), //sender pubKey object
    [],
    1 * 10 ** 6 //amount in lamports
  )
);

//consider revising to return message instead of signature.
const signature = await web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [
    {
      publicKey: new PublicKey("FROM_ACCOUNT_WALLET_ADDRESS"),
      secretKey: 'FROM_WALLET_SECRET'
    },
  ] //keypair of sender
);

```

Accounts are confirmed countless times and those are 100% correct, but still this throws ` Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: invalid account data for instruction` - doesn't make any sense üò©
`So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112` is not a token account. it is a mint.
in token program, there are three kinds of accounts, multisig, token account, mint account.
a token account is used to hold tokens.
a mint account, you can treat it as a ERC20 token.

so back your qn, you can use https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/b2fad8a0781bddd90c8e9b768184f55306265cef/token/js/src/state/mint.ts#L73 to decode So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112

Hello ! I tried to use some functions from solana web3 sdk in React Native (Expo) in my project and I get this strange error . 

 "@solana/spl-token": "^0.1.8",
 "@solana/web3.js": "1.32.0",

System : macbook pro M1 chip, macos Monterey 12.13.1
I want to mention that I cloned this repo to get familiar with solana : https://github.com/jferrer/expo-solana-wallet and it fully works on the same machine.

Do you have any idea why ?
I'm using these package versions but should be fine, right?
```json
"@solana/spl-token": "^0.1.8",
"@solana/web3.js": "^1.31.0",
```
Fails due to the same reason. `InvalidAccountData` I have confirmed many times each account address is correct... pfff
shoot me a DM if you want some help
I can probably help you out with this. I would first use getParsedProgramAccounts() since this is a bit faster/less data intensive. displaying it correctly should just be a matter of converting the data
My first guess would be it's going to be something react specific like `useEffect`, assuming that's the library you're using for functional components. Could you copy your code into a codesandbox or similar and share a link?
cookbook isn't the greatest example of a token send also.... You can try this method, i know this works:
```
 //building the token transaction
      let transaction = new web3.Transaction().add(
        splToken.Token.createTransferInstruction(
          splToken.TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
          fromTokenAccount_pubkey, //token account pubKey object
          toTokenAccount_account.address, // to token account pubKey object
          from_keypair.publicKey, //sender pubKey object
          [], 
          amount*10**decimals, //amount in lamports
        ),
      );
    
      //consider revising to return message instead of signature.
      const signature = await web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction(
        connection,
        transaction,
        [from_keypair], //keypair of sender
      ); 
```
make sure your using the token account public addresses and not the pubkey that owns the token accounts
To be clear, the https://solanacookbook.com/references/token.html#how-to-transfer-tokens function fails, and the only difference I can find from successfully sent tx is the USDC mint ü§î
Hey there! I am trying to build a simple UI that displays a token address and the amount of such token using a solana public key account. I use the Get Account Program, so far I can Console.log everything(the mint address, token amout etc...) however whenever I try to extract that info to display it on a functional component it doesn't work! does anyone can give me a hand on this? (I know is probably a basic thing, I am just starting)
For example, `new PublicKey('EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v')`
Sending USDC from wallet to wallet https://solanacookbook.com/references/token.html#how-to-transfer-tokens

Comparing the transaction instruction data sent USDC using phantom, and the above function. And the successfully sent tx using phantom has different mint address than the `PublicKey`generates for `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`
that is the correct USDC mint. What are you trying to do?
What's solana USDC mint address? I thought `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`is it but seems like that not true. I thought address === mint address, but its not? ü§î
Hey, how can i get details for a specific transaction signature ?
anyone know what i can use to deserialize the candy machine config in rust ?
how do you add a geyser plugin? there is no definitive instruction on how to integrate it, is it installed alongside RPC server or integrated with a program?
Hey there. Any explanation as to why there is no restriction on the CLI to the number of decimals a token can have, even though a token with 19+ decimals is not guaranteed to work on every case? (Due to base units being stored as u64)?

I can create a token with up to 255 decimals in Solana and break the explorer, receiving no errors. Try token mint `7L8hvYsw28HCEzAY6etojEceDKkoT7H74gLehjiczFKa` I created with 50 decimals on Devnet, for example.
Instead of doing `bump = the_bump`, just do `bump,` (weird, I know)

oh ok, thank you i  will look into this. so basically the spl-token library will be used to transfer token from account A to B. something similar to https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/e8b7009cc4d8cdd87232ccfc9ce93ab203ada496/token/cli/src/main.rs#L707 ?
CPI = cross-program invocation, which is how you invoke a different contract from within your own
Looks like you'e already got a dependency on spl-token, but you would need to use it as
```.toml
spl-token = { version = "3.2.0", features = ["no-entrypoint"] }
```
sorry im kinda new to rust dev but what is CPling
Yeah, by CPIing to the spl token program
where can I find examples of c/c++ used in programs? (other than hello-world)
is there a way to transfer spl tokens on-chain using any other library or sdk?
Ah, you can't use the solana sdk on-chain (it's for off-chain use)

I'm building a system where I wanted to derive public keys from a single private key so that I can authorize transactions for many public keys without having to store private keys in the database. Instead I could have one exported in the env during app build-time to reduce attack vectors.
Is there a standard/protocol for these things? Where there are a lot of deposit wallets generated for clients and the server should be able to sign transactions for those wallets
your best bet is to change the derivation path, instead. but you'd still have multiple private keys, except you can derive them all from the same passphrase
you can't do single private key from a passphrase = multiple public keys. you need to get a different private key per public key
Is there a way I can derive multiple public keys using a single private key + a passphrase ? If so, which BIP do I use for this ?
any updates on this ?
that would be the opposite of what I told you
depedns on the transaction
no, then I get `returns a value referencing data owned by the current function`
Is there a specific order in which one has to supply accounts to process_instruction()?
take the pubkey by reference
When I upgrade on mainnet, it tooks SOL without success.
How can I get this amount?
After we Auto-merge our SPL-token metadata for the first time, are we able to Auto-merge an update?
it's driving me crazy
like a simple, you have a function that takes in an account, gets the key from the account, puts it in the array, puts in a second u8 seed and returns the whole
how do you return a seed (of which one of the seeds is a public key) from a function? whatever I do Rust keeps complaining
I haven't found any good resource on this yet
https://docs.metaplex.com/auction-house/definition#auction-house-receipts
Anyone here familiar with getting AuctionHouse receipts from Metaplex? using the `connection.getProgramAddress(AUCTION_HOUSE)` API?
I would like to filter accounts by my auctionHouse ID and then use it to get all `ListingReciept`, `BidReceipt`, `CancelReceipt` and `PurchaseReceipt` accounts for an NFT `mint` account.
actually I realized it's the tx _simulation_ that's failing... it doesn't even show in the explorer:
 ```   
Error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x1
```
`Error: failed to send transaction: invalid transaction: Transaction failed to sanitize accounts offsets correctly`
this is my first time coming across this error can anyone let me know what this means?
hmm I tried airdropping solana to my test wallet but it still errors out...
hmm I got `Transfer: insufficient lamports 0, need 1552080` during my tests... how can I airdrop tokens to my accounts with anchor (for testing in localnet) ?
meh, found out thanks to SO that I should have provided the key of the account I was creating too (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70406575/what-is-signature-verification-failed-in-solana)
thanks a lot mate, always helpful üòô
I'm trying to test something and I get Signature verification failed.. wehre can I inspect the logs or find more info ?
can we use this endpoint for mainnet <@!788215642070581289>  ?
yes this "https://ssc-dao.genesysgo.net" endpoint works fine for me aswell
I think it depends on your design. transferring to ATA or origin account are both fine (and valid)
not sure what's the scenario. to me it will more like an ethereum contract thinking.
in Solana, you can use user's account to do anything in your program.
so I think it will more like when a user call your program then you transfer his SOL to some where if failed. just revert it.
or you can use https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/sysvars#instructions to check other instruction's situation
Thanks! I'll use it to transfer that NFT out of that account. If I later want to send the NFT back to the initial holder account, should I use the same method to fetch the previously existing token account?
```ts
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";

(async () => {
  const connection = new Connection("https://ssc-dao.genesysgo.net");
  let tx = await connection.getParsedTransactions([
    "5ztqPmdFUzHhBoYaYQ9vnPegeGBeEWBhe8LtcCfXB8E3rDvM1EgXBukBumtoYXCWP9oTNkgvrKax8hzrhExPsy2e",
    "5STNSxtUDDZfrn8NzM5UBZXFwkaF7mTSCZ1L8E7Djh5PXYb19iwxS8Q8GP5Kp7E6cvaY7jbwtsZWQetm2h9P4VD4",
  ]);
  console.log(tx);
})();
```
sorry I changed the endpoint due to I hit the rate limit. but it seems work fine to me.
i mean SOL, how can i verify (in my program) that a user is sending me SOL token and not anything else (wraped sol for example) -
getParsedTransactions will take an array on signatures as input ,
getParsedTransaction method worked but getPrasedTransactions() doesn't work
your mean wrapped SOL?
just check mint is https://explorer.solana.com/address/So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112
I just get some random tx and it works fine. not sure what happen in your side.
```ts
import { Connection, clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";

(async () => {
  const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl("mainnet-beta"));
  let tx = await connection.getParsedTransaction(
    "5ztqPmdFUzHhBoYaYQ9vnPegeGBeEWBhe8LtcCfXB8E3rDvM1EgXBukBumtoYXCWP9oTNkgvrKax8hzrhExPsy2e"
  );
  console.log(tx);
})();
```
const transactionHistory = await connection.getSignaturesForAddress(_publicKey).catch((err) => {
            console.error(`Error get transactionHistory: ${err}`);
        });
yeah. For now there are some NFTs won't store in our ATA.
you can use https://solanacookbook.com/references/token.html#how-to-get-all-token-accounts-by-owner
to get what is the real token account which hold the NFT.
Hey, is there a way to verify that a token is of type SOL token ?
what's the signatures?
thanks
Hey <@!788215642070581289> , what is your experience with the getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount returning TokenAccountNotFound error for some NFTs (the ones which ATA owner was changed through setAuthority, probably done by Magic Eden listing/delisting)
networktype = mainnet-beta
const networkType = await KeyManagement.getNetworkType()
        const connection = new solanaWeb3.Connection(solanaWeb3.clusterApiUrl(networkType));
        const transactionss = await connection.getParsedTransactions(signatures)
        console.log("Transactionsss: ", transactionss)
its used by a program that i'm plugging into üòï
basically we will use it on client side. if your program need it, just pack the result into your instruction so that your program can get the account info
what your code look like? maybe use a gist let me know.
or rather you can use it on the client side only?
so basically new_unique from solana_program is faulty?
you can't use random on program.
https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust#depending-on-rand
[TypeError: Network request failed]
what's the error?
FYI https://solanacookbook.com/guides/retrying-transactions.html#facts
`/node_modules/@solana/buffer-layout-utils/lib/esm/web3.mjs`
`Can't import the named export 'PublicKey' from non EcmaScript module (only default export is available)`

So i'm intergrating my solana web3 with my react app and i'm getting this error and I can't seem to make sense of it anyone encounter this problem as well??
anyone had an idea how i can implement stake pool in defi ?
check the program's api, there might be a function to calculate this PDA for you
Hi, im using getParsedTransactions() method to fetch transaction history, but it works fine for devnet but while switch to mainnet-beta it throws network failed error, can anyone help ?
I thought maybe it's ATA at first but it's not üò¶
oh sorry, it's different for each wallet and NFT. So if I'm buying same NFT from same wallet every time - this public key will be always the same.
how can I find/calculate that public key? I can see it's somehow related to my wallet public key and this program (it's unique for each wallet), but I can't find a way to calculate it in order to pass to instruction
hi all, i'm having a problem with Pubkey::new_unique() function. I am getting a "invalid PT_DYNAMIC size (0xd8) warning" at compile time, and "ELF error: Found writable section (.data._ZN14solana_program6pubkey6Pubkey10new_unique1I17ha2b7fb560b29dc4bE) in ELF, read-write data not supported" at runtime. Is there a way i can use this function and not get these errors?
Hi, does anyone have a problem with transaction confirmation on mainnet? I increased the connection timeout in Connection object to 5 min but it still timeouts üò¶
Error: 
Transaction was not confirmed in 300.01 seconds. It is unknown if it succeeded or failed. Check signature 28NeMWSBDbBAHmevz9YQF8tT9qEEijs7mJEVEJApsk9vYoUXwsFwHNV5dQPfq2yWyNvax6BnKigyJbBz4whEruKr using the Solana Explorer or CLI tools.
that's the account that is being initialized, you must provide the public key beforehand, if it's from a program you might need to get the PDA the program is trying to initialize (that account?) and pass it with your instruction
is there an anchor discord? I'm trying to mark a PDA with `rent_exempt = skip` since I don't plan the PDA to last the block, but when I do so I get
```
error[E0425]: cannot find value `__anchor_rent` in this scope
```
why smart contract in solana called program
guys, any ideas what this account might be? and how to get it?
Following up on this, I did some tests with one of the failing NFTs. 
- If that NFT is sent to another wallet, the problem goes away (obviously, as the ATA changes)
- BUT, if I return back the NFT to the original owner, Phantom moves it back into the problematic ATA again. That is quite interesting, as Phantom cannot be using getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount for that... they may be looking for past token accounts by owner maybe. 
- Also, if I do getAssociatedTokenAddress for that owner and mint, I get a different address. I guess I could be creating that secondary ATA and move the NFT there to solve the issue. 

Interesting related read here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/issues/2497#issuecomment-944159188
Seems like there is no way to retrieve those anymore. Sorry for your loss.
they are paying the deficit out of their own funds, and trying to do some damage control first
but in doing so, burned 400/1800sol
team is trusted and did the right thing and refunded to everyone who was "scammed"
I mean the project that scammed was using this team as an escrow to hold their funds
Yea
Nvm this shit was scam
let me work backwards again
yea
Yes that's just token account.
heres a close account trans
https://solscan.io/tx/4vq1sdU8tLRAxAGPU1unrhoyscsnuHw3b81Vb6h4pFfwV8TwPoSTbaPWcGbbTpSomTceUdRKEckeds1PNTAqq5nf
Like vlamez said, the address should be owned by system program or there should be an api to handle this in solana token program
when you burn the token
hm
is it possible that the sol gets transferred to the wallet with update authority or something
yea i wonder how much is out there
They should add an api to transfer sol which are stuck like these in spl token program tbh
Weird thought, but is there a delegate mechanism that allows the mint account to transfer SOL on it's behalf via the `update_authority`?
wild
well the token account only holds the standard rent. That balance is not held as rent which is whats puzzling me, its just like xzy token has a 2 Sol balance
I mean ye you would def get it burning token account.
just standard rent ~.002
you get no rend from the token, but you get the rent when you close the token account it was held in
So If you burn that particular token, you only getting the rent sol?
that dev won't be deving
i'm just scratching my head how they got that list from the candymachine in the first place. And personally id like to know where the sol goes when you burn that actual token with a balance of 1.99 sol on it
Damn 400 SOL gone like that. ü•≤.

Welp! It wont be happening again for sure.
but I
so i don't think they were planning on actually issuing a refund in the first place. Most of those projects just launch and everything is fine
they're providing escrow  forth another project
We recently also had to do something like this at my company. Ran like 50 devnet airdrops before doing them on mainnet.
I don't know how they arrived at that data
Its just being careless
yea but I don't even know bow they obtained the list of token addresses rather than wallets
Who goes mainnet without testing thoroughly lol
The kills the whole purpose of having testnet and devnet
doesn't matter how much talent you have
it was so simple
lmao, mistakes happen
I'm not sure what they did
There is devnet and testnet for it like
lol
Ye but if you talented enough to write the whole thing, how can you make that mistake like??
WOOOOOPS
Woops
it was scheduled for an entire refund of like 1900 sol
this isn't the first time this has happened, there's likely thousands or tens of thousands locked up in a similar manner
I luckily caught it for them
üò∂
yup
416 sol
Oh shit
208 transactions were sent that way
you can't close the mint account
the mint account is not the token account
I understand the mechanism
So sud be 200 sol I reckon?
100 of em
Its just not in that single accouny
I was testing a few things with their devs, including burning the token in cli and closing the account. Where did that Sol go?
Wow it really is 2 SOL in there

so million dollar question
yep
Oh ye that would solve the issue.
if there were an api via the spl token program to transfer sol from a mint address yes, but there isn't
Even if its owned by spl token?
must I specify Foo's account when calling Foo so that Foo can use it when calling Bar?
Shouldn't it still be able to transfer the sol?
Oh dear
yea thats what I was thinking
you can't do that, it's owned by the spl token program
Have you system transfer from mint address ?
ie by closing a mint account somehow if there is 0 supply
team has talked about maybe introducing tools to walk it back
yeah if sol gets sent to the mint address it's in there forever
so the token itself has the sol balance of 1.995~ and the token account has the expected rent
that is one of the transactions sent
https://solscan.io/tx/4Sty9tn5PSWqmxVbuyRd83wkZBREQJRN22vvsNUqonu8Uv7zJtUdMjk2yZvWSgCnHJsjCZePid5KhP79DUhQxt5m
Can you provide the mint address?
Ah sure.
one sec
lol, its been driving the team insane
let me grab and example
Oh lord.
You mean token mint address?
the solana was send directly to the token address from the looks of it
haha no
You mean its a token account?
The account is the token itself
When you close the account, you would be transferring all the sol in that address
How can you close the account, if there are still sol remaining in that account?
Hey guys, I'm trying to help a team recover some sol they sent out incorrectly. I want to tell them that it is gone forever but want to double check here first. Their dev sent refunds of 2 sol to about 200 addresses, but it looks like they were token addresses and not actual wallet. Is there a way for the wallet owner to retrieve the Sol from the token itself (shows a balance of 2.002 sol)? Burning the token and closing its account only withdraws the rent as expected.
Ah nah. The link you sent me worked perfectly fine. I was answering the other guys question haha. The guy deleted his message ...
to use in normal js
Guys where i can find spl-token minified bundle ?

but seems like the devnet is out of fund
you can install solana command line tool and use `solana airdrop 1 <address-here>` to get some devnet SOL
which steps you stuck? maybe just follow the cookbook step
so when calling Foo, I'd pass Foo?
when you call Foo, you should pass accounts which is Bar needed.
then in your Foo program, you use invoke or invoke_signed to Bar and pass accounts info into it.
is it possible to retrieve the account info associated with your own program? ie I'm a user calling Foo, and Foo calls Bar via CPI, but Bar wants Foo's AccountInfo in the invocation, how can Foo do that?
seems like the faucet is dried
may i know where should i get some solana airdrop on devnet?
dont think so.
i have no idea about it tbh.
Oh I see.iwill try that.thankyou so much
only system program owned account can use system program's transfer instruction.
for this account, he is already owned by the program Hp.........
so you need to use https://solanacookbook.com/references/programs.html#how-to-transfer-sol-in-a-program to transfer SOL out
So I have invoke signed, and pda seed as signer for that  pda account
Im trying to transfer that back to another wallet
Yes,that's the pda account. I have solana transferred to that account .
how about the message?
a tx is composed by signatures + message byte array
so if the final message byte array is different, the signature is invalid.
I can't see what you're doing now. I can only guess the situation
what's your tx do? you use this account on devnet right?
if yes, this account is owned by the program Hp...... 
this account's SOL can only be modified by it.
that account?
how do i verify?
The account you're trying to send the money from
wym by verify the account here ?
I did check signatures, they are the same
I am using Phantom wallet to sign
I guess u didn't verify your account is the reason for the error
hi,
```  failed to verify account 7kabtb7RYVFUUArFLjnSJXL6zR9LzwNo2zBTyYuNtVqi: instruction spent from the balance of an account it does not own```
what does this error means ?
how you generate signatures?  just guessing it is different between the origin message you signed and the final you send. maybe print them to compare
if you want to call another program in your program, you need to use invoke or invoke_signed.
Since the verification error is random
I did try to inspect Transaction object of failed & success properies seems to be same
Hi team
I am facing issue simillar to 
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/22391
how to delegate spl token account to pda from contract?
Morning folks! 

I bumped into this error (see screenshot) when attempting to follow the example provided by Anchor to extend our protocol to throw errors. I wonder if there is something I am doing wrong.

The section of our protocol i am attempting to extend
https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/truesight_protocol/blob/throw_errors/programs/truesight_protocol/src/lib.rs#L215-L222

The anchor example I am following
https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/blob/master/examples/tutorial/basic-4/programs/basic-4/src/lib.rs

Any advice to point me in the right direction would be great! Thanks! üòÅ üëç
I've opensourced one over here: https://github.com/z-institute/sol-batch-token-transfer
generally means stop. if your tagging people with here and everyone, several people, or other non support friendly posting, that is not encouraged.
What does the stop üõë mean?
yes i did üòÑ
i guess you need to give it more than a quick glance?
on a quick glance, I see that this talks about failed transactions, but my transactions arent' even sending on the network. They are being simulated and are failing?
thanks, ill check this out in the morning
You are probably here though, https://solanacookbook.com/guides/retrying-transactions.html#before-a-transaction-is-processed
blocks are queried by slot height, not blockhash
did some logging, i got `using block D18kucARLULgZGgrq87TwKjmC3K5tCXk4Jv2raNrnL2t for transaction`, yet the block doesnt exist when i put it on solscan?
yeah, but i think its sending me the wrong latest blockhash value?
that should do the trick
weird
wdym? I am getting the block through the `getLatestBlockhash` method
Try adding block has to the tx .
all my transactions are getting `Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found`, any way i can fix?
@here
I am trying to change the authority of a SPL-Token on the terminal but can figure where I am going wrong. Here is the command I am using
 ```spl-token authorize <TOKEN_ADDRESS> <AUTHORITY_TYPE> <AUTHORITY_ADDRESS> --authority <KEYPAIR> --config <PATH> ```
Hi, just wondering  what causing this error ``   Program log: Custom program error: 0xa3``
I was thinking about using the `connection.onProgramAccountChange` Would it achieve the same result?
currently I can make the logged in wallet sign the tx but the created account can't sign it
I'm creating an account for my program, I want to pass the account keypair to signers to sign the transaction and make the current login wallet sign the transaction as well how can I do that
Hi everyone, so I'm trying to deploy a node js solana web app with Heroku. The command used to get the app running on localhost:3000 is serve -s build. In heroku everything builds successfully but the app says error. I think the issue is in my Procfile. In the Procfile I have this listed: web:serve -s build but I think this is incorrect to get the app started. Does anyone have any suggestions on what to put in the procfile for Heroku to start the app correctly? Thank you.
yep I think you got it üôÇ
i guess..
ok I looked into the SPL token program code:
some actions require checking ownership (or authority), for example during transfer. 
The token program will destructure the account's delegate, and pass it (if present) to `validate_owner` (https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L270-L275)
nothing prevents you from specifying a PDA as a delegate, or another program, afaik.
in the `validate_owner` check, other than checking for multisig, it also checks if the owner info `is_signer == true` https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L1005

So, from what I understand, `invoke_signed` will set the PDA as `is_signer`
There are RPC providers that can run the node for you, I think for less than that a month
Na, anybody can create a transaction with a PDA in it.  So the presence of a PDA doesn't mean much. It's only the signing of a PDA that's significant wrt. indicating that the program the PDA was derived with is in the call chain
Oh! That's interesting. Is building a validator the only alternative to getting accounts data?

My goal is to get `ListingReceipt/BiddingReceipt/PurchaseReceipt/CancelReceipt` account data whenever a user interacts with my `auction_house` instance.

It seems to me like running a $1000 service on AWS to index accounts is a bit of a leap financially and time-wise. How long does it take to setup a validator node? (I'm new to validation and indexing)
I'm not sure what I said is dumb actually
or is it that the presence of the PDA is indication of it being signed? ie, it's impossible for users to invoke an instruction with a PDA in it?
The "signing" of a PDA is simulated by the runtime when `invoke_signed()` is called. PDA addresses are not on curve 25519 so it's impossible to actually sign a transaction with a PDA like one would with a normal ed25519 keypair
yeah I get that the PDA will be signed, but how, from foo, do I inspect that the PDA is signed? that's what I wanted to ask üò¶ or does "invoke_signed" sign the whole tx with the PDA, thus marking the PDA as `is_signer` ?
yes that's right
When the bar program invokes foo, it needs to use `invoke_signed()` to indicate that the PDA in question should be "signed" by the runtime. It's a little tricky, I don't have a good reference to a nice simple example for you unfortunately. But hopefully some of the community support folks will spot this thread and know of a good link to send your way

Hey all. Question:

1. When indexing accounts using the `solana-accounts-db-plugin`, does this mean that you end up running a validator node?
yeah, and also it can only be signed by programs from which it was derived... but I still don't understand:
how is the AccountInfo of the PDA marked as "signed" ? `is_signer == true` ?
"fact #4" on that page touches on it: "Programs can sign for their PDAs by providing the seeds and bump to invoke_signed"
how is it marked as "signed" as you were stating earlier?
yes it will
is the PDA going to show up as an AccountInfo in foo, then?
Maybe something in here will help: https://solanacookbook.com/core-concepts/pdas.html#facts
hmm could you elaborate a bit more on this? or where should I read more for this information?
for non-cpi, same thing.  the user conveys their authority by signing with a keypair they hold
typically signing is used to convey authority. bar could sign a PDA, and foo by inspecting that the account was provided signed and is correctly derived from bar could know that bar called it (either directly or indirectly)
oh? so in non-cpi it's different?
hmm... how can I verify it then?
say I have program foo and program bar, 
bar calls via CPI foo, how can foo verify that bar called foo and not something else, for example?
In the CPI context?  No, not currently
you can't "undo" notifications, likewise you can't undo that transfer
is it possible to retrieve the caller of my program ?
ah sweet. now thirty people have been phantom pinged... way better
Since that is the case, I'll remove the message in hopes of not bothering any one else I tagged
thank you for the response
I'm sorry but if you transferred SOL to a Token mint account, it's unrecoverable

Very sorry to bother you and the team. obviously won't do it again, but just trying to help a few hundred people recover 250 dollars that I can't get back due to my mistake
tag you all? Because I am looking for potential support from the solana team and felt this was the best way to achieve that. As I said in the message, I am sorry for it as I know its not proper behavior but I am in a state of desperation
And I mean mention two dozen people.  I didn't even read it as I refuse to support this behavior
why would you do that?
Sorry for the huge ping but I am in a bit of a desperate state and hoping one of y'all may be able to help. I was performing an escrow service where the business folded so I was refunding the supporters. In doing so, I had been sent the mint address list rather than the wallet address list and was not made aware of this until I was about 25% of the way through, over 400 SOL sent to the wrong place. Right now it seems like there is no way to withdraw that SOL (burning the token, closing the account, anything else I have found does not work). It seems like I either need a new tool added to the spl-token library or some other magical way. If you do see this, thank you for your time.
ok, I'll try messaging some of them and see if I have any luck. thanks for your help
They're part of the team, yeah
Do you know if the contributors are part of the actual Solana team? or are they just "verified" developers
Sorry, just other people in this discord, no direct contacts
I know you're in here a ton, do you have any contacts that I may be able to reach out to at solana? I know thats a big ask
üò¨ that's my understanding
so i'd have to get in touch with people at solana themselves, request this, and pray they can actually do it. In other words, impossible
As far as I'm aware, the only way to get it back would be for someone to add a new instruction to the spl token program
well that would be multiple thousands of dollars that I just lost. Do you have any ideas on a potential solution or if it is even possible to build something that would fix this?
That's not recoverable
Ah, you sent the sol to the *mint* https://explorer.solana.com/address/AhVDpwYB6xBi3ifCaMx36VFLppdUCb3ttg2F5JTMhDAm?cluster=devnet

Are you sure that's where you sent the sol?
In the first link, if you go to transactions, the second one down is where I sent it 1 sol
In the other two links, if you go to the sol balance change tab, you can see that the 1 sol never moved
That token account didn't have any extra sol in it

This was the token: https://solscan.io/token/AhVDpwYB6xBi3ifCaMx36VFLppdUCb3ttg2F5JTMhDAm?cluster=devnet

spl-token burn HajMsJDm2a2jdh17j8ZAYGiT7d6jTdFjqsQ8zom54UYd 1
Then:
spl-token close AhVDpwYB6xBi3ifCaMx36VFLppdUCb3ttg2F5JTMhDAm
What about it didn't work?
this did not work
Whoops, yeah, what trent said
Closing the account would give you all of the lamports there
burning doesn't give anything back. you have to close the account (which you can now that the balance is zero, post-burn)
How can you send to multiple addresses at one time with solana adapter? Ex. If I want to split up a refund into two transactions to two different wallets
So I have tried burning the NFT and it gave me the rent back but nothing else
Unfortunately the only way I'm aware of is to close that token account (doing so lets you recover its sol)
I accidentally sent SOL to a token address rather than the wallet address that holds that token. Does anyone know an easy non-cli way to get that SOL back?
do i need to actually create another account to handle that ??
Hi, so when i try to transfer sol from the data account? why is it not possible??
hmm i have no idea about those.. works completely fine in mine
I cloned serum wallet adapter repo then install dependencies then run and I got this
well i used it and it works perfectly fine for me
```js
    tx.feePayer = wallet.publicKey;
    // to sign
    let signedTx = await wallet.signTransaction(tx); 
    let txId = await connection.sendRawTransaction(signedTx.serialize());
    await connection.confirmTransaction(txId)
``` something like this
hey guys, does onSlotUpdate or onSlotChange on solana-web3js means a new block has been produced?
serum wallet apdapter got a bunch of dependency conflicts
anyone have advice on how to install solana cli on mac? I keep installing it, and then it gives me the path prompt. I proceed to run the path command, but everytime i exit and come back to run a solana command, it doesn't work and i get the error
zsh: command not found: solana
user serum wallet adapter
How can I pass wallet signer as a program signer here? it requires a Keypair type but I can't get it from wallet object
ok
Once you finish building you can delete the target/ directory and save a bunch of space
Cargo uses a ton of space when compiling rust projects üò¢
i got 150GB in trash im dumping. ill try again
i dont have enough HD space
why is solana taking up 42 GB when i try to build it??
I just found an open issue specific about this: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/issues/2514
Ok, I'll keep investigating also
Well that kind of change is allowed, it is just a setAuthority on the Token program (that is what happened here https://explorer.solana.com/tx/2XriJk2mD4mHn3hqjqsXiKpq94NSSb1tTdVe3JYH4XGq7FMEcs9DCZZEdF46xJ1nyfDuwhwzJEdRBwpK7s929rL3).

I can't really understand how that allowed action breaks the getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount functionality
Actually I lost my train of thought writing that post lol, now I'm back to being confused what's going on but too sleepy to double check tonight‚Äîas far as I know ME was going to fix this ownership transfer issue though
I've tried to reproduce it listing / unlisting my own NFT, but no luck. Maybe ME fixed it already.
wow... that is quite an issue
The issue is that the ATA you posted above, https://explorer.solana.com/address/GmZRx5UVh7FS4G62YjRbcAvhRxfvHoKQHBqdRSxwg9K6, has had its owner field changed; it was originally made for 88Cn1AmvsdFvuZHXD7ESsTvimpdstMveoa2FN6N3DA2E but is now owned by BimQcRpPnLj562m9SEikfdJft3dHHcKN777xPfWZcD1s (take a look at its first tx, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/48xPdTsxuYKCVW657QmMjtRHPC4VC2ptKeQxtse8wiUwj1AemhTscxVhinWkBLYNaZBKdVdXWEwP5grYDaKYMUWK)
from 1 wallet to another
Hi, is there a way to transfer SPL tokens through rust code?
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/src/actions/getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount.ts#L84
Urgh, ok, I think I see the issue, and yeah lol, it's because ME is being dumb ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It got me thinking if higher TPS is just a slogan QQ
Just makes no sense :(( 
Why would this problem exist when avg TPS is 1900?
Me too kept trying üòÖ
<@!470799930227949618> I basically just kept trying it and it eventually cleared successfully. Kinda annoying, but I got it done. Three or four attempts in a row were required for token creation, as well as account creation, as well as minting üò¨
Here it is:

The call
const account = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
      this.connection,
      this.wallet.publicKey,
      new PublicKey("7ucKvaW5R5m6A98DANQmuup86hD1DVWFfnVrvz1Uq6GY"),
      new PublicKey("BimQcRpPnLj562m9SEikfdJft3dHHcKN777xPfWZcD1s")
    );

The trace attached
And actually, yeah, now that I think about it, ME does apparently do some dumb stuff that could mess up getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount, but I thought it would throw a different error
Can you show me a stack trace of the actual error?
I'm going to try on a sandbox to make sure it is not related to my dapp flow
that's it
Just try to use that same mint + owner?
Interesting, so what should I do to try to reproduce?
Plenty of SOL in there for a spl-transfer
I can send you an example, easy to reproduce. That method should return this account for the given owner and mint. But it fails with that error. https://explorer.solana.com/address/GmZRx5UVh7FS4G62YjRbcAvhRxfvHoKQHBqdRSxwg9K6
At any rate, getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount is super super simple under the hood
That's what I'm talking about

NFTs are all just regular old SPL tokens at the end of the day‚ÄîI'm trying to think how magic eden could have anything to do with it ü§î
I'm not aware of any way that could happen, for what it's worth
Is there some update happening today or something?  The explorer showed TPS dropping to close to 0 a littel while ago
Hold up - I just got one through
I'd love it to work like that. But I've found some cases when it doesn't. Seems to be related to NFTs that has been listed on Magic Eden
I just used Phantom to test the transfer because everything was timing out on the command line
DEFINITELY
It will create the account if it's not already there
Why would getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount fail with TokenAccountNotFound?
Mmm the problem is: if I want to transfer back to that owner the same NFT, I'd need to use "getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount" to resolve the account where to transfer it. Will it also fail with TokenAccountNotFound? If so, that's a problem... where do I send the NFT?
Have you definitely got enough SOL in the fee paying account? How long is it between the transactions being created and signed/sent? And also what is Phantom doing here, if you‚Äôre using your own RPC and the transfer is from command line?
Not sure sorry, I haven‚Äôt looked. If there‚Äôs not an equivalent on connection though, then it‚Äôs probably just calling signTransaction one at a time then returning all
No luck
I'm dying here folks - any advice?  I've used a paid RPC (Figment), a free one (SSC), and just mainnet-beta
Have you tried the classic delete node_modules + reinstall? Maybe drop the lock file too. It sounds like it might be an NPM issue and usually nuke + install again works for that
because I can't really understand anything from the react wallet adapter source code
do you know what exactly is the difference between sign and signAll
Not sure if there‚Äôs a signAll, but there‚Äôs connection.signTransaction and also IIRC connection.sendTransaction
I'm getting either this:  ```unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds``` or ```RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found ``` on like all of my attempts
How is it that Phantom is timing out, and I'm just trying to do simple spl-token transfers from the Commandline and we're getting no transactions through?
Anyone who has ever used the react wallet adapter. The usewallet() hook has a few functions like `signTransaction()` and `signAllTransactions()` How could I replicate those, using just <@893467316564676698>lana/web3.js and my wallet private key?
nvm searched and seems like you still have to deserialize manually. i'm just going to go with the Dummy wallet approach for now ü•≥
tried this too with `const parties = await connection.getParsedProgramAccounts(PROGRAM_ID)`  , but the response i get still seems to have `data` as a uint array. ü§î
yeah that one caught me up for a while haha 
glad I could help. ü§ù
okay so I tried to recreate a new project, just install web3 and spl on it, and it works. Still don't know why my actual project doesnt work, maybe do u know command to debug project dependencies ?
awesome, getTokenLargestAccounts worked. I owe you one üòâ
sounds interesting. havent done something like that so not sure, however if all else fails you can always use metaboss to completely rewrite the metadata yeah
at least thats what worked for me
just get the largest accounts for that token mint and grab the account with a 1 and you should be good
no problem, noticed that error would happen for NFTs that were listed on Magic Eden
thanks mate! I'll give it a try
I set my collection to hidden in the config file. When minted my images are replaced with a logo like I wanted. When it is time to show the images and traits what is the best method I should use. Would you suggest metaboss or something else?
could be a variety of reasons. actually had that same error and used connection.getLargestAccounts() instead and that worked for me
if you prefer a guided tutorial, i thought this was super accessible while still taking time to explain important concepts: https://lorisleiva.com/create-a-solana-dapp-from-scratch
what do you mean by revealing?
Having a bit of trouble **revealing** my nfts. Can anyone suggest a simple way to do this?
Why do I get this error when doing: 
```ts
 web3.Keypair.fromSecretKey(
                Uint8Array.from(myKeypair)
            );
```
```ts
Error: bad secret key size
```

The keypair is 100% correct
thanks! that seems to work and was quick and easy. here is what i did in case someone else finds it useful later: 
```
import { Transaction, Keypair } from "@solana/web3.js";

const DUMMY_WALLET = {
  async signTransaction(tx: Transaction) {
    return tx;
  },
  async signAllTransactions(txs: Transaction[]) {
    return txs;
  },
  publicKey: Keypair.generate().publicKey,
}
[...]
useEffect(() => {
    const provider = getProvider(wallet || DUMMY_WALLET);
    const programInner = new Program(idl as Idl, PROGRAM_ID, provider);

    setProgram(programInner);
}, [wallet]);
[...]
```
no problem!
Bro, thank u. You're awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
well whatever you wanna do this is a fantastic resource! https://solanacookbook.com/#contributing
Oh, got it
dApps probably would wanna have some javascript/react knowledge before diving into the API
Hey wise Solana overlords, I'm really struggling with this one: I have an NFT (token mint)  and I want to obtain the associated token account where it is stored, given its owner (in order to transfer it to another account). I've been using **getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount**, which works most of the cases, but** for certain NFTs** it doesn't, **returns TokenAccountNotFound**. Any explanation for this, and any suggestion?
depends what youre trying to do with it
Hi, guys!! I've a question. If i wanna learn to program on solana, what should i learn first?
You can also just pass in a dummy wallet that conforms to the types, something like
```.ts
const dummyWallet = {
  async signTransaction(tx: Transaction) {
    return tx;
  },
  async signAllTransactions(txs: Transaction[]) {
    return txs;
  },
  publicKey: thePublicKey
}
```
You probably want a Connection object (from @solana/web3.js), you can use that to make read-only RPC calls without any particular wallet
right now i have this code: 
```
const useSolana = () => {
  const wallet = useAnchorWallet();
  const [program, setProgram] = useState<Maybe<Program<Idl>>>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!wallet) {
      return;
    }

    const provider = getProvider(wallet);
    const programInner = new Program(idl as Idl, PROGRAM_ID, provider);

    setProgram(programInner);
  }, [wallet]);

  return {
    program,
  };
}
```

so if a user has not connected a wallet, then we can't make a program. and if don't have a program, we can't fetch anything from rpc api, even if it's just to "read" stuff
dumb question, but does anyone have any tips to initialize a "default wallet" on the client so that users can read data from accounts without connecting one of their wallets?
Are you able to repro in any shareable cloud environment? Or Docker?
personally on react/TS and same pb
Are you on the latest Node LTS?
How can I convert SOL into wrapped SOL using the CLI?
Not sure why TBH
this works in codesandbox but not in Node.js environmet
already tried to remove and re add the package
yeah same import, same version, <@!518960773545066500> has the same problem than me
Does my codesandbox work for you? I'm using 0.2.0 there, and:

```
import {
  createMint,
  getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount
} from "@solana/spl-token";
```
`Module '"@solana/spl-token"' has no exported member 'getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount'.`
unfortunately do the same code and got this error

tried quicknode and it works
Do you have a codesandbox or something? I can't repro this: https://codesandbox.io/s/pensive-sky-2oebrg?file=/src/index.js
i see ><
Not sure. Usually it times out for me if I send too many transactions. But I now use QuickNode's RPC for all my scripting to go around this. Struggled before on devnet.
I see some sporadic discussion above but has anyone been able to figure out deploys recently? hasnt been working on both mainnet and devnet `Error: Custom: Invalid blockhash`
what error msg will i see if I'm rate limited?
yeah i think it's rpc node's issue, may I send too many tx
I see. You can also check the transaction logs on https://explorer.solana.com if it outputs nothing in the terminal.
with all the same configuration
the rust problem works well sometimes and sometimes doesn't work, so it's not the program's issue ><
i wrote a program in rust to batch send custom spl tokens, I'm in Taiwan, OS is Linux
This is what I've done. I think it works üôÉ haha
In my case my local machine is in China. All calls to Solana's RPC's usually fail unless I run my requests behind a proxy
Are you using the CLI?
Can you provide more information about your error? I think it's hard to tell what the cause might be from your earlier messages/
Thanks.
it get stuck when showing [0/1] Finalizing transaction
u have to do some test but maybe put a getAccount method in a try / catch
is there a potential solution to this error?
How do you check whether an account exists or not?
True. Had come to sat this.
can't import it
yeah bro we know about that but this function isnt callable with the 0.2.0 version
You probably want https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/token/js/modules.html#getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount, which will create it only if it doesn‚Äôt exist and otherwise return the existing one
simply check before if the token account already exist
I get this error when building my project. Any ideas how to fix this?
it has a probability to fail sometimes, is there a solution? thanks:)
I want to report it to a solana dev, I think it's very unusual.
hey, has there been an update to the network in the last ~3 days? I started observing a very strange behaviour that didn't happen before and my onchain program has not changed in months.
me too!!!!! üò¶
Not sure if this is good for scenarios where the token account is already created for the recipient.
Thanks I ll try it later, it seems like the doc isnt up to date, happy that u made it
I used `v0.2.0` here
<@!178602642077908992> This was my final solution.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

How can I reach someone from the Miami Hacker House event?
do you have any specific youtube vids on rust for beginners that you know?
All done
ty! yeah it feels weard to start learning javaScripth or anything first when my goal is to learn Rust anyway
Great üôÇ
If i try to set my keypair with solana config set --keypair usb://ledger?key=0 it tells me no device found. Solana app is running on the ledger
def can start with rust. good base as well.
https://www.rust-lang.org/learn
free code camp and youtube, and other popular learning sites have some rust related resources as well.
Hello, is someone familiar with the solana CLI and ledger?
Might be the wrong channel to ask, but i am.

So i would like to learn Rust and coding in general to be able to create something on Solana in the future, i have heard you would nee to learn:
Rust, C and C++

but is there some language i should start with as a complete noob to coding? or whats my best Path to become a solana dev? or Rust dev? ty ‚ù§Ô∏è üôÇ
lmk how it goes im around
thanks, i will try
this was useful the other day for something similar i was stuck on
https://www.simplenextjs.com/posts/debug-vscode
i'll check how ot enable debug / breakpoint
i don't think so, pretty noob here on that ech -.-
did you configure vscode for nodeJs debugger?
can you setup a breakpoint on it?
VScode
what IDE you using
am I missing osmething oO
I have a try catch that is not trigger and I'm running it from nodejs server so I do not have access to browser tools etc
and it maybe a XHR request too.. so sometimes those are hard to see
and above line u got a try / catch around that?
just from a dev perspective i would think batching w/ a large request regardless of the endpoint is needed
oO
it doesn't have HTTP code ot whatever
maybe you need to batch the requests?
res is a Promise<Array<ConfirmedSignatureInfo>>
const res = await connection.getSignaturesForAddress(pubkey, { before: oldestTx, limit: 1000 })
that what I ask, how can I check this, tehre is no error status using solana/web3.js
i noticed when i switched between diff RPCs.. i would get variable results or 0 altogether
well when you get 0.. are you checking to see if your getting like 429 request error too?
? I replace getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2 by getSignaturesForAddress, seems to be better but the problem I have is sometime it return me 0 item, I would like to handle a real 0 result and an RPC problem, have no idea how to do it...
id have to agree
That was anchor error
I got help from anchor dev. Thank you
Hi! I'm planning to make an Ogame-like game on Solana. I have 4 resources and I plan to make these as different cryptos.

My game have a cycle of 5 mins, on every loop I update the resources depending on several parameters: building, skills, technologies, etc... 

If I make these resources as crypto I have to pay fees on every transaction right?
And if players pay a new building with these amount of resources they have to pay fees right ?
I think I have an RPC problem, is there a way to debug RPC call from javascript ? log something liek a response status ?
sounds like a custom program error.  ask the authors of that program or go code spelunking
hello, I try to write the code in JS to get all TXs from one PublicKey, at each run I got different result, sometime I have 4000 item, sometime 13000, etcc with the exact same code, I use getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2. Am I missing something ? 
Code is pretty simple, I have a loop

connection.getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2(pubkey, { before: oldestTx, limit: 1000 }

where oldestTx is always the last signature, why the fuck I got different result at each run for the latest TX ?
where can i find the error number
Hi, what is 0x92 error in solana ?
this doesn't really make sense. the point of base58 is to stringify binary data
How can you turn a string to base58, any ideas?
Not sure what the problem is

I am getting this error while deploying program with solana cli

```

My command

```
solana program deploy --program-id <program_keypair> <program_path> -k <payer> --upgrade-authority <payer_address> -u <custom_rpc>
```
Transactions have to be deterministic (this is just how blockchains works), so no network access, no randomness, etc.
Does it have to do with atomicity of transactions ? I'm unable to interfere with on-chain data even for reading while inside the code issuing a new transaction ?
You have no network access of any kind/have to pre-specify all on-chain data of interest from the client
None unfortunately üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Oh, I see, thank you. So the question is what api  can I use on-chain which is analogous to client side calls like, for example, getSignaturesForAddress ?
that's not the full output.
I dug into their code, and that looks like it's because `sys` is filled up with items for windows and unix-like systems, but not for anything else.
Actually, you should get an error: https://github.com/rust-lang/socket2/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L127 in that case, which is missing from your log.

You can't compile anchor-client for the program that is on-chain...
Those are all network-y things, none of which work on-chain
Sounds like you have a dependency on some stuff that can't run on-chain
https://pastebin.com/QWWY7dKy
The publicKey is a property on the wallet you get with e.g. `useWallet`
ah ok thanks,
The signature of your entrypoint is `(program_id: &Pubkey, accounts: &[AccountInfo], ix_data: &[u8])`, its' that last argument
Hello everybody! I am implementing the solana-wallet-adapter(working just fine) but I was wondering how could I use the this to extract the public key of the wallet I connect, any ideas? I want to display the tokens and amount in a UI (so far I did, but I am hardcoding the wallet address, I was wondering if I could get it manually.
You get the raw bytes
do i need to unpack it or anything, or I can just use something like: `msg!("Data: {}, instruction_data}`
Yeah ^
it's part of your entrypoint's `instruction_data`
How are you writing the rust side?
Hi guys, when sending data instruction in a transaction eg: 
```js
new web3.TransactionInstruction({
      programId: programId,
      key,
      data: Buffer.from([1234]),
    })
  );
```
how can i read the data instruction in Rust code? 
i just want to be able to send a simple Integer into the data and use it in rust code
can you upload the full error log somewhere like pastebin and share the link here?
Hi, thank you for the reply. As far as I can see many (if not all ) of the errors are related to file ...socket2-0.4.4/src/socket.rs. I updated the toolchain to no avail. I'm very new to Solana so I have a vague idea of what is going on. I also tried to work without anchor-client, using anchor-lang and solana-client for rpc api, but I was unable to build the project neither, it looks like because of version clash between these two crates.
Hello guys, I think this issue can be closed https://github.com/solana-labs/bpf-tools/issues/39
I have written a comment, mentioning the steps to go around this problem
Yeah, can you post the actual errors?
Hey folks üëã 
Anyone able to give me a hint or two as to how I can retrieve staked accounts for a given wallet via the solana-sdk crate?
I can see em in solscan, I just cannot seem to retrieve them üò¶
if any of the errors says "experimental feature", then yes
Hi, I'm trying to use anchor-client 0.23.0, it's the only dependency in my cargo.toml, unfortunately, the build fails with numerous errors while compiling with Rust stable v1.59.0. Should I use a nightly toolchain to be able to work with anchor-client ?
Any help on this one, is it become of the low TPS on Solana?
in essence - I don't know where to find the css/js for the modal, and how to customize it?
My question - how could I customize / overwrite the CSS for the connect wallet button? I'd like to use TailwindCSS. Since I'm importing things from packages, all I'm doing in the actual js file is rendering a WalletMultiButton, and the rest is being taken care of for me.
Ive got another one! I'd like to add a "connect wallet" button to my website, and am planning on using the Solana wallet adopter packages to do so. I'm able to run this locally and it works as expected.
It still weird how its not working
I probably need to wait and make sure the account is created before bqckend does something g ..
The call on front end is redundant, but im just checking if the account exists.
And I make another call at backed to fetch the data again
I fetch the data before I make a call at backend
Well the account exist
did you initialize the account in the code (if it should be initialized by your program, of course).
For example I make use of a PDA just to "provide a signature" basically, but don't initialize it or load it with any lamports, so by the end of the transaction the ccount is empty and the explorer says it doesn't exist.

if you are sure it should exist, or you can see manually that it does exist, you probably need to wait for tx confirmation on your code... `anchor.getProvider().connection.confirmTransaction(tx)`
seems like it. Spending more time in the command line than I'd initially thought, but I know it'll pay off down the line
Just try to fetch data after the tx is completed.then i make a backend request to fetch the account data. And it gives me error saying that account doesnt exist like wtf..
Hi, I got this anchor fetch in client issue  and its bugging the shit out of me...
but yeah, there is indeed a lot to learn... You can write code right away, but that won't get you very far in the real world.
Tooling is essential in your skillset, much more than one would think
and get some help from good people along the way
and yea haha, just gotta keep pushing through it
thank you üòÑ
welcome to software :P, if you have the will and the curiosity I'm sure you'll figure it out! üòÑ 
also, tbh, your question was very smart and aimed, you were able to recognize what you didn't know very precisely! that's not something you see everyday!
Im new to coding, and it feels like there's a mountain of stuff to figure out before I can write one line of code haha
thank you so much
that is such a helpful explanation
cloning a repository is _only_ copying the files in the repository.
dependencies and such are not part of the repository, just like `npm` wasn't installed when you cloned the repo üòõ 
projects usually have dependency _specifications_ in their repository, which is what package.json or Cargo.toml are, somewhat.
so `npm install` will take care of fetching all the dependencies that the project needs to be built and run (with a few exceptions, sometimes!)
Just so I understand - if I download a repo from a forked github repo, what's going on that its not automatically installing next?
you should post the full cargo output, for linking errors usually the last few lines actually contain the most clues
I think that might be the issue
bingo üôÇ
perhaps forgot to `npm install` ?
any thoughts?
'next: command not found'
morning! I have a n00b question that I was hoping someone could help me with. I'm trying to run the Wallet Adopter Next JS example locally, and I'm having trouble getting it to run. I've cloned the repo successfully, and when I type "npm run dev" I get an error that says:
can anyone help with this error https://github.com/solana-labs/bpf-tools/issues/39
Hi, I have a question about staking:
Is there any way to "transform" an already used account (that had some transactions before and has some SOL on it) to a stake account? I know you cannot done that with cli, but could it be possible somehow?
lovely, thank you

Hey, I am getting this error while deploying on mainnet

```
Error: Custom: Invalid blockhash
There was a problem deploying: Output { status: ExitStatus(unix_wait_status(256)), stdout: "", stderr: "" }.
```

I have checked `solana cluster-version --url mainnet-beta` it is `1.9.13` so I am also using the same version of solana cli to build the program.
It's on their github repo README.md or somewhere there

Did you check their Discord?
How is that different than if I transfered SOL from my account to your account? Also, Lamports are not stored in Account Data
Who decides the SPS Target?
devnet
testnet?
but in the code in that account I do airdrop of 1 SOL üòÖ
the account does not have any amount of sol I think

hello i have this problem i dont know why but can help me please??
nice !! thanks !!
Using anchor doesn't absolve you of knowing how to do the pure rust stuff, but realistically it can be way, way faster/less error-prone to do things in anchor than in pure rust.
why would you suggest anchor over pure rust development without anchor framework?
a tx is composed by instructions.
an instruction can be SOL transfer, token transfer, create account ...
any function in a program we can call it an instruction

> Can anyone help me to detect transaction amount and transaction type
I assume you want to monitor transfer value, maybe you can
1. use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction there are pre/post balance and pre/post token balance
or 
2. parse instruction by yourself.
maybe https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/blob/59f267655e3041cd5c91fa30ecb0c82ccd7afd30/token-metadata/program/src/instruction.rs#L523-L547

hi guys, anyone knows here if it's possible to change updateauthority for an nft ? if yes, how ? i checked with metaboss, but can't find what i need
rn, the solana network is kinda slow, so might be linked
We're seeing very high latency in confirming mainnet transactions. Is this happening due to mainnet congestion or could be something at our end? Any solutions. 

We'e seeing Latency of: 8000-10000ms
is there more documentation on Anchor's `#[interface]`? I'm trying to use it to make my contract Foo be able to call any contract that implements an instruction `fromFoo`
Hi, Can anyone help me to detect transaction amount and transaction type
Who decides the SPS Target?
hi, i have some general questions, maybe i am stupid:
programs are stateless and access data accounts which store states 'for them'
if only the owner of said data account can deduct lamports but anyone can add to it, how can this be a reliable way to store a state?
Yeah it was a bug in my code... obviously, but I've learnt a heck ton about how transactions get confirmed so I guess that's a positive
In as much they can't be modified unless you deploy a new version, yes.
Thanks bud ‚ù§Ô∏è
if someone mint his own NFT with my collection name, people might think we are the same collection.. how can i bypass this ?
Hey, is Nft collection name isn't unique??
Why can't it work with multiple filters?
Oh it works with just one
Coolio
I don't think you're supposed to have multiple dataSize filters. try with just one
Yet I'm positive the allocated account sizes are accurate. Here is an example of the `PrintPurchaseReceipt` PDA data size from the explorer:
When I apply this I get an empty array
```ts
    /**
     * Allocated data size on auction_house program per PDA type
     * CreateAuctionHouse: 459
     * PrintListingReceipt: 236
     * PrintBidReceipt: 269
     * PrintPurchaseReceipt :193
     */
    const accounts = await this.connection.getProgramAccounts(
      AUCTION_HOUSE_PROGRAM_ID,
      {
        commitment: 'confirmed',
        filters: [
          {
            dataSize: 236,
          },
          {
            dataSize: 269,
          },
          {
            dataSize: 193,
          },
        ],
      }
    );
```
Here's an example of what I'd doing:
you set the data size to 193 bytes, not sure what your question is
Thanks. I was just reading the cookbook here. What I'm confused about is whether the `dataSize` filter accepts the allocated size of the of the account. For example if it is 193 Bytes, how can I apply this filter?
https://solanacookbook.com/guides/get-program-accounts.html#filters
Does anybody know how to filter `connection.getProgramAccounts` using the `dataSize` filter parameter? does this accept the allocated size of the PDA?
how can I speed up the clock forwarding in solana program test? I set up my own test environment and modified the ticks per slot and target tick duration, but it seems that it's still very slow, I'd like to increment in 1 month periods, but I get time outs
is the warp_timestamp_again feature from sdk::feature_set optimizing the time per slot? or is it the reverse and it's slowing it down?
if any instruction fails, the whole transaction fails and no account state changes are persisted
If we have multiple instructions in a transaction and one of the instruction fails, will the whole transaction fail (and the successful instructions  will also not be executed in the end) ?
hey i have a vault authority which is a auctionManager which is PDA i am trying to get my nft from a locked wall when its authority is on auctionManager. now the problem is i cant sign my instruction with a PDA solanacookbook suggest to change issigner property to false. but in contract there is a check is issigner is false throw an execption. can anyone tell me a workaround. my main goal is to get my token out of vault after the vault authority is given to auctionmanager
Does anybody know how to filter `connection.getProgramAccounts` using the `dataSize` filter parameter?
Are there any paid RPC Clients?
And why I failed to deploy,my balance still decreased.
Can I know what happened with this error? Is the problem of my network?
Hi
This is composed of transaction instructions
1. Sol tansfer from wallet user
2. Send NFT token from seller to wallet user
I am trying to execute this in one transaction
1st instruction need signing from wallet user (buyer)
2nd instruction need signing from seller
We tried to make a single script to do the same (having seller private key)
Sometimes 
transaction.serialize()
Methods completes successfully
But 
Randomly the "serialize()" fails with singnature error
Seems like it is similar to
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/22391
Thanks for the patience
Is it possible to implement some sorts of randomness on solana?
Are solana programs immutable?
Hey! hello everyone i have a problem to finish the transaction with my wallet adapter, summarizing when i do it with the functions "const signature = await sendTransaction(transaction, connection);" (class brought from wallet-adapter's useWallet()) doesn't work, it sends me 3 errors, this is one of them "{code: -32003, message: 'Transaction creation failed.'}" but when I use the web3 function directly call "sendAndConfirmTransaction" if the transaction works, does anyone know why? It should be noted that I am doing a transaction of spl-tokens
u.u
i have the same problem i don¬¥t know how to import getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount
Seems like this has been an issue for a while
Yeah whats going on with this? Seems like the type definitions are incorrect or something? TS is telling me to import `Token` but it doesn't exist

hello, does anyone know why program instruction is unknown, I'm pretty sure I named it "Initialize" but why it displays as "Unknown"?
ooo really?? ok ok let me check thanks :3
are you using the latest version of @solana/spl-token ? I think a mint account is created with the InitializeMint function now - > const { InitializeMint } = require("@solana/spl-token");
Hey I have a bit of a design question, I'm creating a pda to store a message passed in by a user. I've allocated 180 bytes of space for the message on the state account. But when I am trying to deserialize the state struct on the data of the pda, if the message is not exactly 180 characters I get an error along these lines 
`panicked at 'source slice length (121) does not match destination slice length (180)'`

is there any way I can store the state if the message/data buffer is less than what the state struct is expecting? My initial idea was to add a bunch of 0's to the buffer if the msg was less than 180 characters but idk if that would mess up the deserialization of it later on when trying to read the stored state?

pub enum SystemInstruction 
index 2  [2]  = Transfer
not sure if that is whats going on here.. but it adds up.
lookup up in something like..   u can look at other instruction, in programs, for index ref as well.
sdk\program\src\system_instruction.rs
thats also generally where comments are made that show usage and what to pass.
yea, if its using the system transfer, and or when looking at other programs and their instructions, transfer.
of solana?
you can check the source code the see instruction index.  thats generally how you call transactions, as well. by using the instruction index/equivalent.  generally an instructions.rs.  enum.
mean*
oh cool, they show what all the indexes mezna?
seems to be the way to go, based on the instruction index. when its known.   you can double check how Solana Explorer can name these as well, under solana repo explorer.
Hey guys got a quick question, how do I determine whether a transaction was a transfer? Is it if the program id index is 2? That is the only thing consistent between the transfers I have found (besides the number of accounts involved being len=3)

Sorry for the noob questions but no resources I found online state it clearly how to tell
Looking at https://docs.solana.com/integrations/exchange#poll-for-blocks I see they have a program id index of 2 as well
After how much should I request the block hash? Also is it better to spam the same transaction or to spam different transaction in parallel?
Ok that makes perfect sense, thx!!
The logic behind 0 retries is basically that sending the transaction multiple times with retry=0 has a better probability of not being dropped than sending your transaction once with multiple retries. If an RPC node is retrying a transaction and the queue is long the block hash has a chance of expiring and transaction getting dropped. Spamming the transaction with retry=0 gives you a potentially better shot at getting the transaction through
Thank you
But i got it
Yeah the issue was i couldn't reinstall
easiest way is to reinstall it and see what path it gives, and then manually put it in your zsh/bash/other termina profile based on what your using for startup .. based on your path:    export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
But not for 1.10.6 idk why
This worked thank you
i think 1.10.6 doesn't work on mac right
Weirdly enough 1.10.3 install worked
Mnn I don't really understand why would that work
I see, I mistakenly had maxRetries set to 5 while still using their custom rebroadcasting logic. The rebroadcasting helped a lot though, not sure why.
<@!785084693023424542> Can u tell me what this means tho
Like why wouldn't it work if I let the rpc node retry my transaction many times automatically without resending it from the client?
Still don't understand why they suggest maxretries to 0 and a custom rebroadcasting logic tho
Solana cookbook under "retry transactions". SkipPreflight set to true helps your transaction to start faster since it doesn't do any simulations, with that being said your are more likely gonna have failing transactions for stupid reasons like insufficient balance or sold out CM etc
??
Where did you hear this? Is it really better to set maxRetries to 0? 
Also, how does skipPreflight play in?
once installed the install lives in the folder its installed in, and referenced.. as long as your CLI actually works correctly and loads the env variables with the correct path in their, like any other CLI tool or path variable..  make sure its in your  CLI/Terminal  profile to load on new terminal sess.
How do i set the path variable without the the command it gives me after i install
interesting.  im not caught up to speed on that feature - but that does not sound right if what your describing is in fact whats happening.  all accounts are supposed to be rent exempt however in that case, and if there is an account associated, that is not yet, and was already created, that could be the issue..
yeah i follow what the docs tell me to do every time
sounds like a config or machine/setup issue.  the CLI doesnt have anything to do with this.
you need to set env/path variables if its not being done automatically on your system, as outlined in many install guides

Why in a congested situation it's better to set maxRetries to 0?

Ok but if I transfer authority the new owner is only one who can close the program and reclaim the sol I'm assuming
anecdotally, Phantom seems to get far less frequent transaction failures than i do. I'm using the retry logic in https://github.com/StrataFoundation/strata/blob/master/packages/spl-utils/src/transaction.ts#L275 . Any ideas on other stuff I can do?
Hi! Do you know guys with Anchor how to prepare a transaction in front, send to backend for add my signature and push to my program ?
you can close the program and reclaim sol.
you can update the upgrade authority on the program account.
`solana program --help` `set-upgrade-authority`
the higher the commitment the more time it likely takes. varies based on many factors - congestion, network, consensus. there is not really a good measure of time afaik. things like this vary in high throughput. as i recall the ideal or goal is seconds or less for finalization and every layer can affect this from start to response.
how do I transfer ownership of my solana program to another wallet? and is it possible to withdraw rent from the program account?
how much does the commitment level impacts a transaction latency?
This only happens on my local test validator and only started happening today, not sure what's going on
basically I generate a burner keypair in the browser with web3.Keypair.generate and send sol to it with 
```SystemProgram.transfer({
  fromPubkey: program.provider.wallet.publicKey,
  toPubkey: burnerWallet.publicKey,
  lamports,
});```
I use the keypair to send a series of transactions.
Then I send the sol back to the main wallet:
```SystemProgram.transfer({
  fromPubkey: this.burnerWallet.publicKey,
  toPubkey: this.program.provider.wallet.publicKey,
  lamports: balance - fee,
});```
This is when the rent exempt error happens
not enough details. but by default i recall the validator has everything unlocked/activated (features), where devnnet and most other networks do not. so something there may likely be the differentiator.
When i try to empty a wallet on localhost with SystemProgram.transfer, I get this error: `Transaction simulation failed: Transaction leaves an account with a lower balance than rent-exempt minimum `.  I don't get the same error on devnet. Does anyone know what causes this? I'm on 1.9.14

I have some questions about validators

1. how do we gain access to the validator-support thread?
2. if I have my own validator, does that mean I have my own private RPC endpoint?
3. if yes to 2, does that mean I will have no restrictions to it, i.e. I can call 1000 requests to it if I want?
see https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/master/js/packages/cli/src/commands/mint.ts `mintV2`
i'm not sure how the solana cookbook is doing it, but elsewhere I'm using the metaplex js code to mintnfts
so ideally what im trying to do is not have to rely on this metaboss script
`metaboss mint one --keypair keypair.json --external-metadata-uri https://arweave.net/${id} --receiver ${walletPubKey}`
in the employee dashboard of my site, i have a way to generate the Arweave link that is the URI for the NFT. i save it to my database then run a script locally that will mint any NFTs using their respective URI with that metaboss command.
this works perfectly and it mints directly to the users wallet.
problem is it requires me to have to do something locally on my machine versus have it be a part of the dashboard.
this scaffold does some minting with a config setup,  but just realize to actually mint, you require certain addresses and signatures, based on the minter and candy version.  this may help tho:
https://github.com/thuglabs/create-dapp-solana-nextjs
no problem. i will keep doing more digging myself. thanks in advance!
sorry I haven't been able to find anything yet, I've asked over in the metaplex discord, will ping you if I find something
much appreciated!!

Any data-aggregators in the house?

For a project I'm working on, I need to track the real-time movement of  1000 NFTs.

Ideally I'd like to build a component that will alert the system in as little as a few minutes if an NFT has moved.

I don't want to query the JSON api every minute, for each NFT, so looking for advice on what architecture I could build to support this.

Happy to setup my own validator if that's what needed.

Right now I'm thinking maybe I monitor all the passing blocks and query them for any transactions involving one of the 1000 NFTs I'm tracking. 

Open to any suggestions üôè
im following the process in the solanacookbook to mint an NFT.
https://solanacookbook.com/references/nfts.html#mint-the-nft
it uses the metaplex/js library and has this piece of code which does the mint
`const mintNFTResponse = await actions.mintNFT({
    connection,
    wallet: new NodeWallet(keypair),
    uri: 'urilink',
    maxSupply: 1
  });`
this requires me to know the keypair of the wallet i want to mint to. is there a way of doing something like this but minting to a wallet with just the Public Key of that wallet?

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
so only the token program has access to close it
its a PDA derived from the TokenProgram
Yeah but it's strange as I create a mint using a keypair then it's not a FDA then it lying on a curve then we have private key then theorically we could have the hand of it
i guess since the token mint is owned by spl_token program u cant do anything about it
<@!270368441972555776>  By The way big thanks for your effort it's help me a lot, be thankfull man
i understand that
a token account, and a token mint are 2 different things. as stated above. 
there are some overlap in terminology.
that really just closes the token account to ur keypair if its init
misleading
```ARGS:
    <TOKEN_ADDRESS>    Token to close. To close a specific account, use the `--address` parameter instead
```
<@!270368441972555776> I end up with the same consideration
u can only close token accounts
ah weird, i guess the cmd line is misleading
<@!270368441972555776> which cmd has you submitted?

solana is slooooowww
üò®
ü§ò
im running the cmds now
<@!933749030234755082> then I guess <@!785084693023424542>  is right we cannot close a token mint
correct
no its not a loader
then a mint != t han a Ata
as far I understand:
Mint auth and freeze auth are for mint
Close auth and ower auth are for the token-account
id like you to share the spl code for creating and closing a mint account. 
let me know if close works for you.
can i use UpgradeableLoaderInstruction?
data account
what kind of account are you trying to transfer?
i cant find the method in https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/1.10.5/solana_sdk/, am i looking in the wrong place? Y-Y
<@!270368441972555776> Yes, we can, but it's my fault as I'm do not provide all the info.
then let's me re-frame:
There is a token mint created using a keypair.json (meaning the address of the mint is an address coming from a keypair.json)
I transfer the ath of the created mint to an secret keypair.
Is it still possible for the owner of the token mint keypair to close the Mint?
to close the mint, u need to be mintAuthority
itll tell u all the options
just run spl-token close --help
```    <TOKEN_ADDRESS>    Token to close. To close a specific account, use the `--address` parameter instead
```
if its ur own, then u can close it
depends for which account
ya u can still close both
yes update update authority
token mint and token account.  2 different things.
ok, thanks <@!270368441972555776> then if the mint auth has been transfered is not possible
``` --address <TOKEN_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
            Specify the token account to close [default: owner's associated token account]
```
is it possible to transfer ownership of account
use the token account address
same cmd
spl-token close
oh
u have to be the mintAuthority
it close a token-accoutn not a mint
for full list
spl-token close --help
` spl-token close [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <TOKEN_ADDRESS>`
lol <@!270368441972555776> And how can we do?
you can close a mint account yes
<@!785084693023424542>  I love u. You just save my life
no. not afaik, or recall.
hey guy is there a way to close a mint?
o ok thanks
may want to check the solscan discord/support channels.
has anyone here used the solscan api?
Yes. I will take a look on that. Thanks !
interesting. wouldnt have been my first guess. id look at that constructor and see what in there could be breaking. debug as needed. break it out if necessary.
I already compared the package.json files from my project and that project and installed all the necessary ones. The difference is I‚Äôm using the methods from the sdk in another order but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be very important. The moment I comment the line that I‚Äôm creating a new public ( new PublicKey(‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù) ) key, everything works. If I uncomment it the project breaks.
is there any way I can speed up the slots forwarding in solana program test, to avoid timeouts? without setting up a bank from scratch
Okay, thank you for the response. I will look further into it.
for specific errors your better of copy a line or two of errors here, and or linking to text version of the errors. images dont translate so well and dont make friendly lookup or copies.  for mobile native and react native, and expo, based content, this is very much based on any limitations of the device and packages being used potentially, and something you may have to troubleshoot.  your stack is multiple layers of potential issues.  expo is another layer and no official support.  it seems fetch/bind may be causing an issue for you - and its the newer universal call to 'get'.  There is little context in your post, and details on what your doing, and how, especially with so many layers is important to figure out why. It would probably be worthwhile to explore the package you say has worked.. and see what libs its referencing and what versions.  many updates have been done to above packages as well. not sure if anyone has expo working with spl-token or web3 lib, in general.

i'm trying to update/close/deploy programs but all my transactions are timing out
anyone having issues right now?
the decimals is just a UI thing. Underneath, the number of tokens is just a u64 integer. So, you can mint as little as to 10^(-decimals)
Is it possible to mint a decimal number of tokens?
I've been developing on solana for 2 months and it's a pain in the ass because of the constantly dropping TPS üò§ 

Seriously, wanna be bearish on any crypto, start developing on it
Is solana devs having a good time in Miami ? cauz every one is waiting for tps to shoot up
i dont eevn know what it means
like risc-v and fpga tho.. ;-;
ive dabbed with lower level .. but not related to the crypto
no too complicated
y? lol
no ;-;
do you know asic
its a mess
and os ;-;
well i did try making few kernel for learning purpose
have you recoded linux or your computer kernel ? b4 using it
hmm half a day lol interesting.. thank you.
raydium is open source so half a day also
lol are you mad, does your car maker did recreate the wheel?
hmm lets say something like raydium?
not like copying their smartcontract code or any of the code.. everything from scratch??
its just a bad UI of etherscan lol
half a day maybe
Think it's a fair amount of work lol
I'm trying to get all the nfts of a candymachine, and I am using the getprogramaccounts function
But it returns nothing, what could be the issue? Could it be because not all nfts are minted yet?
If I wanna create something like opensea  solo, how long it would take ü§£
if someone need to solo create a defi platform (all  backend, frontend, smartcontracts). How long do you reckon it would take ?
isnt it solana to decide on that
ü•≤
ü§£
im opensea lead dev, i need power
how to raise tps to 5k ?
Ah i understand, Ty
You can have as many signers as you want; only the fee-payer necessarily needs to be mutable
Only if you're the fee payer, which I assume does need to be writable. Just signing is free and can be done offline though
but in order to sign a tx you need to pay lamports, which requires the account to be mutable, no?
Nope, signer and writable are separate. Eg I have TS code that does this:
```
    couponInstruction.keys.push({
      pubkey: shopPublicKey,
      isSigner: true,
      isWritable: false,
    })
```
are signers required to be mutable accounts when passed into a program?
hi, is there a way using the py documentation to sign messages? docs seems not talking about it
You could pass information from ipfs in from the client, but the contract itself has no access to the outside world of any kind
<@!913684207618904064>
Nope
Is it possible to read data from ipfs on contract?
fix
On catrack?
for other oracle on solana
did you see https://pyth.network/
Possibly dumb question, but what's the alternative?
yes this is bad idea
Hi all, could you help me understand how the validator actually does, what do the validators do in the simple example of the sample solana counter + 1 program?
Nope, don't think so
Hi guys, can I change the decimals to a already created spl-token?  I want to remove the decimals from it, I can change the info from the official spl token list, but I'm not sure how to change it onchain
Hey guys. I'm using JSON RPC sendTransaction method with preflightCommitment: finalized and in some cases I get txId which ends up not going to the blockchain. What am I doing wrong?
Hi, how do I get the list of transactions for an account using web3js?
E.g. tons of apps have to be able to talk to a database, etc.
Is it so bad to have a private key on your server? (Or at least accessible to your server)
What's the proper way to fetch some data from my API inside a Smart Contract, I know it's with an oracle but which oracle is the best, Chainlink is sooo expensive and provable doesn't support Solana. I need to check user deposits from my own API, this can be done multiple times at a day and these requests do not give us any money, so we are looking for the cheapest solution. Our other option is to do it in the other way, make our API call the smart contract to send approval but that means we have to store our private key in the server and that's what we are trying to avoid. Any clue or recommendation is appreciated
IPFS?
Can you recommend a solution that can handle this amount of data? (1250mb)
All my wallets have 0.04+ but it‚Äôs still not working..
Hey, 

I‚Äôm currently trying to airdrop spl-tokens but keep getting unable to confirm transaction due to expiration or insufficient funds. Which wallet would fund the airdrop of tokens? The token address wallet or the one holding all the tokens
Call getBlockTime() on the slot where the TX was accepted?
Is there a good way to determine what time a transaction reached consensus?
I'm trying to add unit unit tests for two SOL programs such that one calls the other and it appears that I'm hanging on a cross call to system program for a transfer

hey i was wondering if its possible to mint solana NFTs with onchain metadata?
Hi, Im trying to fetch the number of USDC tokens transferred from one account to another using the signature i got for that transaction, and i just used the signature in getParsedTransactions() method, but can't able to figure out number of tokens transferred, anyone can pls help ?
thanks bro.. although weird solution
Using Solana Install Tool
Hello guys! I can't install Solana CLI on Windows 11

Can I write solana programs in golang?
Can I send a http POST request from a solana program?
without knowing my 12 words
Hey, is there a way to import my private key to phantom?
can you please share an example?
Annoyingly, you're going to have to basically just copy the implementation of that function and re-do it so that you send the tx via phantom
ok.. so i updated the spl-token library - now i want to use "getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount" bu ti dont have the user's keypair.. how can i still sign this method (using phantom?)
It depends on what kind of account it is. If it's one of your own program's accounts, you can do `await program.account.theAccountTypeCapitalizedLikeThis.fetch(theAddressItLivesAt)`

no
Have you forked the original repo?
so confused, don't know what the steps are to get it to show here üò¶

but I can't find my commit,. look no sxy branch exists here

i see this screen
Ye I guess
From there chose your local repo and branch

Go in pull requests in the repo merge repo
No, just stay on github
i need to clone the repo as if it's my own?

Try using the current version of the spl token library, I've unfortunately already forgotten how to use the old one
thanks for the help...

until know i did this :

 const mintToken_nft1 = new Token(
    connection,
    nft_1_mint_account,
    TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
    account1Keypair
  );

  console.log(mintToken_nft1);
  const account2Ata_nft1 =
    await mintToken_nft1.getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo(
      account2Keypair.publicKey
    );

but i dont have account1Keypair in my new flow
You don't need the keypair of user1, you only need the address of the nft mint
You need to setup different source and destination branches if you want to merge one onto another
I see this screen and not sure the actions to take.
Feeling incredibly stupid right now..
Trying to submit a pull request for the token list.
But not sure where I should branch I should be pushing too?
hey... i want to create an ATA for user2 for NFT that owned by user1... how can i do it without having the keypair of user1 ???

But the data is weird. Can someone help me how to get the complete data of an account? If I'm decoding the data I received, it's not correct

Hi,
I'm exploring SOLANA REST APIs. I'm trying to get a record using API
Thank you. However, I wasn't sucessful to use it. I went with this code:
```
const {deserializeUnchecked} = require('borsh');
const {
    Connection,
    PublicKey,
    Struct
} = require('@solana/web3.js');

// Flexible class that takes properties and imbues them
// to the object instance
class Assignable {
    constructor(properties) {
        Object.keys(properties).map((key) => {
            return (this[key] = properties[key]);
        });
    }
}

class AccountData extends Assignable {
}

class SolPublicKey extends Assignable {
}

const dataSchema = new Map([
    [
        AccountData,
        {
            kind: "struct",
            fields: [
                ["bump", "u8"],
                ["authority", SolPublicKey],
                ["min-bid", "u64"]
            ]
        }
    ],
    [SolPublicKey, {
        kind: 'struct',
        fields: [['bytes', [32]]],
    }]
]);

async function getAccountData(connection, account) {
    let nameAccount = await connection.getAccountInfo(
        account,
        'processed'
    );
    return deserializeUnchecked(dataSchema, AccountData, nameAccount.data)
}

const connection = new Connection();

getAccountData(connection, new PublicKey('HJXrbMijeUep8CVB7U6doxJhJsjXCZ3j4Fg5Mwd6g6Fk')).then(res => {
    console.log(res.bump);
})
```

This is (https://anchor.so/address/HJXrbMijeUep8CVB7U6doxJhJsjXCZ3j4Fg5Mwd6g6Fk) a decoded program. There must be something I'm missing, because even `bump` is different (I get `235`, but anchor.so shows `255`). Of course, it's not the entire mapping, but do I need it for testing purposes?

I keep getting this: ```Error: Custom: Invalid blockhash
There was a problem deploying: Output { status: ExitStatus(unix_wait_status(256)), stdout: "", stderr: "" }.

```
is anyone else having issues deploying to devNet?
nvm the answer is yes, no we can just change recentblockhash property in that case
Ok thank you.
yea each provider may have better more focused advice.  sockets can be a pain.
in that case transaction will fail right? and do we need to have the new transaction from user again?
I'm using a private node tho. But yeah I guess I'll ask them.
get another blockhash
afaik its up to the RPC how they handle web sockets - if you are using public nodes, the likely hood is sockets will not stay open for long periods of time, for obvious reasons.
there is an unity SDK, are you aware?  or did you have a specific question about it
hey if recent blockhash in a transaction expires then what can we do?
Hello, I have an issue with the solana websocket. The websocket is closing itself after some time with status 1006 and no reason. Anyone experienced this?
Anyone working on solana unity wallet ?
probably easier for a lot of  things yes, I dont believe currently a lot of functionality is exposed in more traditional web2 / api based methods yet.  it also requires an exposed rest/other api layer, and service - it possible there are services out there for this.  blockchainapi might be one. I believe that is one big direction some more things may be headed.
I am calling `spl-token` cli from python script right now to do this. It would be easier to just do a POST request if there were RPC methods to do it.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from subprocess import check_output

app = Flask(__name__)

def command():
    address = request.form['address']
    amount = request.form['amount']
    stdout = check_output(['spl-token', 'transfer', '--fund-recipient', '8Edmysk7PtiMZRMh8cqXUpnpJZ4MXq2BwqJdaDaCo2h8', amount, address]).decode('utf-8')    
    return stdout

@app.route('/')
def my_form():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def my_form_post():  
    return '<pre>'+command()+'</pre>'

app.run(debug=True)

```
the documented JSON rpc api appear to be meant more for 'gets' and subscriptions from what I recall. These are mostly exampled with curl requests right..   you likely want to use actual code for functions that compose things. I believe others are working more consumable web2 based APIs, but I do not think all that is super accessible, yet..
you could create a rest api or service out of the RPC api ,  but that may take some work.
how to code in the console.  then u need to access that object and cast it yourself, or try anyway.  really it seems to be over complicated.  you might have better luck looking at a transaction signature in the explorer at that point üôÇ
I see. Is it possible to do this: `spl-token transfer --fund-recipient 8Edmysk7PtiMZRMh8cqXUpnpJZ4MXq2BwqJdaDaCo2h8 1 tTfbP9xMQ3FXyuyFsK13eeTZp6ebX1FAY1YUNCzRvFr` using JSONRPC API ?
what should i google?
i dont have a way to do it in front of me. if you dont know how to actively convert/cast in the browser with dev tools you can try looking it up. you should be able to do it in the console.
does not appear to be exposed by that API from those docs.  CLI is also not a good way to create and sign transactions.  generally its done with actual code, like javascript, rust, another SDK, etc.

expand toBase58  ?
How do I sign a transaction and create a transaction for signing? Could not find methods for it
<@785084693023424542>
As a string
I wanted to get the pubkey from this object
yea, it has to be signed already..
According to API docs it submits signed transaction
your trying to decode something in the browser.
output for tokenAccount.account.owner.toBase58
yes
i dont know what your doing here..  this looks like console output
this is what i get if i do tobase58
either that or this
not both of them.  toBase58 will convert the BN to a readable public key.  toString can do something similar.  the output above does not make sense.  u have to use toBase58()  its a method.
its not used for that.
```tokenAccount.account.owner.toBase58.toString```
I get this then
How can I declare the following schema with `borsh-js` in TypeScript?

The README.md is not very detailed https://github.com/near/borsh-js/blob/master/README.md
toString(), toBase58(),
`sendtransaction` can be used to send a fully signed transaction. Which method is used in JSONRPC for creating and signing transaction?

https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#sendtransaction

there's a toString method for it

Which wallet did you delegate through <@!911670019396616325>?
I am wondering if the price changed
I have coins, but I keep getting a transaction error
Can you define the trouble
The price would be the transaction fee and the rent exempt fee I think.
Hey so im having some trouble with the "spl-token create-token". Does anyone know if the price changed?
A good read:
https://solanacookbook.com/guides/retrying-transactions.html#facts
Either way it sends it. The commitment is for the confirm. So processed, confirmed, will return with it still having the possibility to fail. You can go for finalized, however you may timeout.

So you are saying it creates a new token account for the same mint? I don't see how.
Any help/advice is appreciated
The sm has to validate a deposit from an api but that validation can be n times, so spending too much money on that validation is not good at all
I know the proper way to get data from an API is an Oracle, I need to request data from a sm but I wonder if there is an alternative to chainlink since it is too expensive for the purpose I need it
does anyone know how the commitment level (processed, confirmed, max...) in sendAndConfirmTransaction affects the transaction speed and reliability?

fuck the whole chain up harder
hell yeah dude spam txs
to make a transaction go trought even during congestion, what should i focus on? Spam more transactions? A particular RPC? Some transactions settings?
here is at least one list, 
https://github.com/ilmoi/awesome-solana-nfts#%EF%B8%8F-rpc-providers
what are some other providers? It doesn't seem like there are too many that aren't like "contact us for pricing"
mainnet generally takes the most abuse - so have backups and alt providers.
the test net is workign fine too, just the mainnet
yeah sreum seems to work ok
try another RPC
Hey I'm getting rate limited really quickly on the `GetBlocks` RPC call, like well before the 40 req/10sec limit. Does anyone know why that might be? Tried on test net and mainnet
generally using tailwind or any framework, u will want to choose your own component lib or make them from scratch - tailwind tries to be more css/html like.   spl-governance has some references to custom components with tailwind, for how custom ones would perhaps be setup.
thank you so much
makes sense
aha!
that particular shortcut is because of most likely daisyUI.  which was used as a tailwind css component wrapper/shortcut, with some basic out of the box components - for time and simplicity.
Can you point me somewhere?
<@!785084693023424542>  another probably very basic CSS question for you. In your dApp Next repo, I see that you apply a classname of 'btn' (amongst other things) to the WalletMultiButton. But, for the life of me, I can't find where that class definition is described. Its not in global.css or the default wallet-adapter-react-ui styles.css file
if your using native and serialize/deserialize yea you have to use the exact space, and some people use padding for future space. if your using something like a string and there is a buffer you want to make sure the schema/mapping when serialized is taking the appropriate space specified and expected on the deserialization end.  spl-governance has many end to end examples, and the cookbook has a serialization section if it helps:
https://solanacookbook.com/guides/serialization.html#setting-up-for-borsh-serialization
anyone have any suggestions for how to handle this gracefully?
makes a lot of sense, thank you. I guess installing the Wallet Adapter directly from npm only really makes sense if I plan to use it off the shelf?
it seems pretty low tbh
yeah trying to run a query on Dune but the base58 decoding is a bit of a pain in sql lol
analytics questions. otherwise speculation.
based on your situation it may be a good initial bet.  so that you can continue to upgrade if needed I would recommend isolating your styles/css from the core functionality of the wallet as much as possible and keep them separated
Hey does anyone know roughly what percentage of transactions are transfers?
secondly I had another issue with getBalance, I figured out that this info gets returned on getAccountInfo under "lamports" and then you just divide by lamports per sol
Seriously appreciate your help here
Gotcha. Sounds like the right approach is to download the source, copy over the correct wallet components into my own folder structure that I need to set things up, and go from there?
if you dont have this only recent transactions will display status

<@!785084693023424542> has helped me solve the issue, looking it appears I was missing the following parameter
not sure offhand if there is a clean friendly way to override styling using the NPM packages directly,  but the wallet adapter is meant to be an example, not an end to end - of the road  - solution necessarily.
no you dont want to have to touch node_modules folder aside from reference.  depending on the framework, download the source from wallet adapter, and modify and reference that in your project instead.
Thanks so much <@!785084693023424542> , and sorry if this is a n00b question, I'm fairly new to coding generally so I'm not as sharp on standard patterns. I guess to put it another way - is it standard practice / safe to be modifying CSS styles for files in the node modules folder?
if you reference the actual wallet adapter project, and the base level projects, you can see how the CSS is applied - and it varies per framework implementation.  for react the react adapter and base adapter, and some frameworks use a themes concept.  if your accustomed to CSS and theme implementation in projects it should be fairly straight forward, but if your looking for a general CSS file that applies everything you will likely not find that. there are some default and root elements everything is based on for simplicity.  searching for the purple color worst case should yield results. its also depends what parts of the adapter(s) your attempting to modify. Reference the source for the actual adapter, and look for themes in at the base project level. If your having trouble with a specific framework package let us know and will see if there is better direction - but its nothing fancy.
Would appreciate any guidance on how to best customize the out-of-the-box CSS from the Wallet Adapter package. Any tips?
I'm currently trying to find where the CSS classes are applied, and I'm deep in a 'node modules' folder and something doesn't seem right (should I even be editing these files if I installed them via npm?)
hi there! Question for the group. I'm trying to use the Wallet Adapter package on a simple dApp project. I'd like to do two things - (1) customize the CSS from what the package uses, and (2) ideally do this using tailwind, which would require me refactoring how the CSS is applied.
dms are primarily scams. public troubleshooting is encouraged.
I'll dm you the link so you can see but its been a consistant problem, we've tried 3 different node providers
is this consistent? and code to reproduce, link?  something thats needs proof.   status should return a status or null if one does not exist. if its an old transaction that might be a different story.
Hey all, I made something that uses getSignatureStatus and I noticed that oftentimes it just returns null for value.  Why is this?  how do I get the status of these transactions, I know all of them are finalized
Hey all. I'm looking for some help with developing a Solona Decentralized Reserve. Similar to Invictus DAO. Does anyone have any resources or recommendations on where to start building the team members or hiring a firm to support our build out?
nice
~~what is the simplest way to serialize an instruction on the frontend, pass it via an api to a backend service, and have the backend service construct the transaction, sign it, and send it?~~

~~feels like this is absurdly more difficult than it should be:~~

~~* rust supports bincode serialization, js/ts does not~~
~~* there is no function to deserialize a `Message` from an array of bytes in rust, while there is in js????~~
~~* you can't use borsh to serialize/deserialize an `Instruction` type within rust, but you can in js/ts~~


~~perhaps im missing something?~~

it appears that bincode is being used under the hood? `bincode::decode` worked

And the account on solana is similar. Then we need to consider which programs can modify which data files by granting ownership. It's like using SUDO to give NANO or Vim the ability to edit files
the anchor discord would probably be your best bet for anchor stuff.  but the above looks like basic permission issues on your file system.. and not related to anchor at all. google those errors.
I understood the architecture and ideology of solana. I treated the solana like a computer. And in there, accounts like files. There are usually two types of files: data files similar to TXT and executable files like EXE or binary.
whenever I do, I get this error

hey guys, I'm having a hard time installing anchor on my local machine
solana does not map 1-1 to ethereum, in some ways, if at all in many others. its very different, and optimized for cost and performance. the best thing to do is take general blockchain knowledge, and start learning how Solana works, and leave ethereum way of doing things in the rear window when developing for Solana.   Neon Labs EVM and Solang are two alternatives to use existing EVM based contracts for Solana. But for Solana dev, your best bet is the above.  That being said, here are some solana-eth docs.
https://solana.wiki/docs/solidity-guide/introduction/
https://www.notion.so/Solana-Rust-Intro-for-Solidity-Devs-e27d881a14794a3199514336ee032d0c#eb143eaecb5c4ff4a5d7129826df83c8
https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
you can access Clock with sysvar inside a program. VRF like functionality and random numbers are not yet something afaik there is on-chain support for yet.  Switchboard and some other oracles may have some related random like capability, otherwise.
To be honest, I've been a developer on ethereum for many years and I've been having quite a bit of trouble getting into solana.
<@!785084693023424542>  Do you have any instructions on getting the timestamp in the contract and generating a random number?
Thanks a lot, I'll probably need to build it myself. I think many people need that function
ok. very likely you need to build it then. thats very specific.
I have researched through bofida and streamflow but they don't have this ability
look above. thats probably as close as your getting out of the box. your likely going to have to search for and find things on github and within the community concerning existing programs, and use that as a reference to modify or build to your own needs and specs..
for example lock 1000 tokens for 1000 seconds and can withdraw 1 token every second
For example I need to lock for 100 days but not after 100 days can I unlock it, I can withdraw it over time
I need something like the following. A contract can lock tokens into it, setting a final settlement time but before that can be withdrawn over time
here is something potentially relatable:
https://github.com/Bonfida/token-vesting
every transaction costs at least something, potentially fractions of a cent.  based on your design and mechanics you work around those features. for apps and games, and most designs, its trying to understand exactly how 'blockchain' is actually used for your app. similar to cloud, the more its used the more you are potentially charged, so design accordingly like you would for cloud storage and serverless call usage.

you have the ability to send multiple instructions inside a single transaction within certain size limitations.
Are there any Vesting contracts with timed balance withdrawal functionality?
Solana and ethereum are very different in certain ways, and have some similarities. There is not a lot of 1-1 mapping, if any mapping at all, for certain features.  It sounds like you need to learn Solana concepts and get familiar with and learn how to accomplish what your trying to do.  Those trying to map exactly and translate an EVM based app to Solana are probably going about things the wrong way, as there are many differences.   If you want to just try and use EVM for Solana, id suggest looking into Solang and NEON Labs evm for Solana. Otherwise, I suggest you educate yourself some on Solana by reading some docs, guides, and reviewing some code or find someone willing to do so that works with you.

alright thanks
<@785084693023424542> 
I'm planning to make an Ogame-like game on Solana. I have 4 resources and I plan to make these as different cryptos.

My game have a cycle of 5 mins, on every loop I update the resources depending on several parameters: building, skills, technologies, etc... 

If I make these resources as crypto I have to pay fees on every transaction right?
And if players pay a new building with these amount of resources they have to pay fees right ?
Well it's just written can revoke via the revoke function. But I don't know if we're talking of the same thing. These are for delegation of token for staking for egs?
post here
I don't know where to post my dev problem !
Can  a dev dm me please ? Thanks
what did you understand about the revoke function from reading the docs in the link?
Cause it's a bit too technical for me
Fine thanks ! But how concretely to use the revoked function and where ?
your runtime program only actively executes when loaded then not. there is no timer in that sense to trigger after 'x', this would need to be triggered from an outside source, which you could do with a service or something else.  times change relative to many things to using a hard cap on a time unless its overly generous is probably not at all reliable if you need to be extremely accurate.
looking
can you check dm please
for things like delegation there is revoke:
https://spl.solana.com/token#authority-delegation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsocPEZBd-M
Hi there ! Got a question. Is there a way to see on solana the tokens approval or contracts approval with our wallets and if so, how ? The same way as we can do and revoke on eth bsc or polygon
Hi,
Is it possible that a program calls a function after a certain time?
And how accurate is the 800ms blocktime. If lets say i want a transaction happening in 100 blocks is it gonna be 80 sec or is it gonna be off by a few seconds?
If its even possible to do such thing

anyone here deployed a program in the last 24 hours?

I keep running into

and I get to < 50 pending (got to 1 pending a few attempts ago) but I keep running out of retries üò¢
thank you I don't think I had rebuilt my program after changing it's programId in anchor.toml, unfortunately I'm not out the woods yet
probably more configuration shenanigans
which is using 0.1.8
npm wants to default to the `spl-token` under metaplex's `node_modules`
ah yeah, this seems to be an issue with `@metaplex/js`
Thanks ‚úåÔ∏è
generally thats a build/setup/cache config related issue.  otherwise npms and yarns generally by default install whatever the latest published is.
okay so for some strange reason, npm installs 0.1.8 by default, you have to specify `@0.2.0` ü§î
apepars to be a few questions. 
im guessing you mean CPI call, cross program.   in any case. msg! appears on chain. if the calls succeeded the msg! gets printed to the on chain logs, which you can view in explorer or tracking with a validator, or log subscription.   
for your cargo if its referencing github it may pull from there, otherwise you want to adjust your cargo refs. 
https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/
these are a lot of good questions but more about design and architecture, blockchain in general, and related to blockchain with Solana. Id suggest you read up on Solana architecture, docs, and start experimenting.  Its more of a stateless design and setup compared to most other blockchains. https://docs.solana.com/introduction
I'm trying to make a CIP call but I can't see any outputs from the `msg!` calls in the CIP when I run anchor test, or in solana logs
Does anyone know how I should make the msg! outputs appear?
I'm trying to understand why "An account required by the instruction is missing" is happening. It seems like the account that's being used belongs to Program that's on it's Github repo, instead of the program I compiled locally that's deployed to my local cluster. For reference I'm trying to run https://github.com/evanmarshall/cross-pile, which has a dependency on https://github.com/evanmarshall/solrand
Hey guys, 

Hope you are doing well. I'm sort of new to Solana. I've been working as software engineer for almost 4 years. Mostly focused on the backend. 

I have a few questions, 

1. How do we scale Solana apps?
For a say REST backend, we can add more servers, add caching layer, deploy them on multiple geolocations and with load balancing and other stuff. 

How do we achieve these for a Solana app? 

2. Suppose I'm making an app like https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon, decentralised and have some integration for accepting payments Sol. 

But as you understand that I'll need to use a database to store other data like posts, comments etc. How does a regular database come in to play in a blockchain? 

3. And which part of the application do I push to the blockchain? 

These might be silly question but I'm still unclear on these. 

TIA
generally the buffer error like that is due to a different deploy or size issue.  if your re using the same program key from something else that could be why.  if your using same code and deploying a fresh program make sure the program id/program key is fresh too.

for the other issue there have been some expiration and misses for transactions, but a few attempts at most under normal conditions, as long as the funding account has enough funds should be enough.
if its being loaded in your require, and is actually accessible from where your calling the function there shouldnt be an issue.
worse case reference a previous version and see if its recognized, as the spl-token has changed recently and it is possible there is some conflict in your code. make sure you can access those other imported objects as well to make sure the refs are being loaded.
if you want to do it in program there are still just much better examples in rust.  you dont need to be a rust expert. just be familiar with syntax and be able to run the programs following some simple instructions. in any case your over simplifying it üôÇ  so youll probably not have a difficult time just following the examples and knowing at least functioning rust implementation.
```
const { burnChecked, TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID } = require(`@solana/spl-token`)
```
`0.2.0 ‚Ä¢ Public ‚Ä¢ Published 2 months ago`
im installing the latest through npm, perhaps npm hasn't been updated
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/token/js/modules.html#burnChecked
are you importing it?   typically u get an import error first if it doesnt actually exist..
also, spl-token has changed recently and cookbook is not all the way updated.
I can use it fine fwiw
What version of the library are you using?
not sure what you mean fetch the main wallet using the token program.  the token program has functions for tokens.  NFTs while similar is different and likely using metaplex if your doing NFTs.
https://solanacookbook.com/references/token.html#how-to-burn-tokens
hmm 
```
        await burnChecked(
              ^

TypeError: burnChecked is not a function
```
coming from delphi, but my dApp should be simple, I dont want to be an expert actually ahhaha, just read token price and put / retrieve orders basically. Thanks <@785084693023424542>
Deployed a similar set a few times (it's built from a template I re-use)
First time deploying this specific set of code.
it is, but is not 'as supported' atm, only meaning most are using rust and there are not many examples or otherwise with c++. rust is a very easy transition from C++ so only benefits knowing both.
<@785084693023424542> yeah, I want to make a simple dApp that put and retrieve orders, read value of tokens, I saw rust could program on solana, but c++ also possible?
could be a few things.  have you deployed many times and is it possible the current size of the program is now larger than the original allocated size?
rust is the way to go.  you can start with anchor is that might be an easier overall start.
https://book.anchor-lang.com/
Can anyone deploy to devnet
and if so, which version of anchor-cli are you on
and solana-cli
Nope https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/js/src/actions/burnChecked.ts

Hi guys, i am completely new to blockchain development. I would like to know, what language should I learn to make a dApp to trade tokens? put and withdraw orders in a token contract? Interact with solana blockchain...
I ran the following:
`solana-keygen recover --outfile ~/.config/solana/temp.json` and recovered the correct Program Deploy Buffer Account but when I run the following:
`solana program deploy --buffer ~/.config/solana/temp.json`
I get `Error: Buffer account passed is not large enough, may have been for a different deploy?`
any tips?
How do I continue a program deployment?
I keep getting this error around 90% mark
```====================================================================================

====================================================================================
Error: Data writes to account failed: Custom error: Max retries exceeded

it seems that you don't use the correct type
When I'm making a CPI call, what do I need to do to make logs from ```msg!``` display in the local cluster logs? I already followed the instructions here: https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/debugging
in that case I just need to fund the contract but manually just to be sure the contract has enough balance to make transactions but there is no need for me (my pk) to sign transactions since the contract is going to do it by itself, does this make sense?
I mean the contract has it's own wallet and can tranfer funds from itself to PDAs right?
Hum, ok.
So here i'm doing `getSignatureForAddress2()`, then i use the signatures with `getParsedTransactions()`.
Does this mean, if a transaction got multiple signer i might get a transaction multiple times ? ü§î
It's not possible to make the contract pay for it? And send the money to PDAs created for each user?
when a nft is staked an account is initialized under a token program
and on unstaking at the end, the account gets closed

so like the nft goes into that new wallet
so im creating a snapshot bot but i want the main wallet rather than the vault one
so is there some way i can fetch the main wallet using this token program, new wallet and nft token
this command does not give me an error but the tokens do not reach my phantom wallet
Sup guys, what should i download for windows?
hello, i am trying to migrate from eth to sol. I had a SC written in solidity which used a library deployed as another SC. The library contains simple math operations like 
```    function add_mod(uint a, uint b, uint m) internal pure returns (uint) {
        assert(m < MAX_NUMBER && a < MAX_NUMBER && b < MAX_NUMBER);
        return (a + b) % m;
    }```
Is is possible to achieve something like this in solana? I am currenty using Anchor for development - is it a common way? I looked into their CPI but I found out, that the programs cannot return a value? Is that correct? So it is also impossible to call a method of the same program and get some return value eg f32?
has `burnChecked` been removed from `@solana/spl-token`?
ok i will try with them
the releases are all in github, including binaries.
if your trying ti use curl you wont be able to run any of the curl commands if curl is not recognized.
still not working
Otherwise you get 403 for some reason
Root domain is release.solana.com, if you want to be safe just replace v1.10.6 with stable üëç
is this link safe admin
can store dat in an account. what and how is up to you, right? account data.  overhead is the space,  which is cost for size you use.
I also had a problem where that URL is wrong. I found this worked:
https://release.solana.com/stable/solana-install-init-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe
transactions can have multiple signers, 1 fee payer
Can I store a custom struct in an account, and if so is there any overhead cost?
your on windows? i would use wsl.  if curl isnt supported its because the terminal, CLI or whatever method your using does not support curl..
Why the parsedTransaction has an array of signature ? 
Can't a transaction can only have one ?
 
```
  export type ParsedTransaction = {
    /** Signatures for the transaction */
    signatures: Array<string>;
    /** Message of the transaction */
    message: ParsedMessage;
  };
```
.
so in the solana form for installing the cli tools it's says run this command(curl https://release.solana.com/v1.10.6/solana-install-init-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe --output C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe --create-dirs) but when i run it i have the following error  'curl' is not defined command.......
you have to describe in detail and provide the info. share what u can in chat. if u dont get it resilved try again and can always link back to the details
so can u plz help me with my issue
that made me angry
if your paying for a transaction the private key needs to be used to sign one way or another, that's how sigs work, no way around it. if its automated, youll have to store and use the key as needed to sign in a service or elsewhere.
i talked like that because i faced a lot of scammers
can u plz help me
sorry
probably need to be much more descriptive.
an error like that generally means an account involved in your transaction has no SOL or balance to pay for fee involved.  you ha e to check the accounts involved and make sure they at least have a SOL balance for fees or for the methods being called.  log the balance, token balance of accounts involved.
hi
i want help about setuping the cli tools
it dont work for me
That's what I thought but that means I have to store the private key on the server right?
Anyone have any help on this?
maybe track this https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/23720
Sure, i will share code part shortly
But
When i checked through forums there is a mention about accountmeta sorting bug
Where isSigner & isWritable values where getting switched or miss placed

Is this already fixed in new web3js ?
you can check size of your .so file. use `solana rent <byte size here>`
it won't be a precise number, but most cost will be the program.
I think you can get an approximate value.
the steps looks good to me. not sure do I miss something. maybe check the serialized message in your side. I don't have any related code can debug
understand. just curious why don't you fetch the information from an API first and then tell your smart contract? I think your contract only your admin can call it?
Hi. I've written this article on our experience doing an NFT giveaway in Solana. Check it out üôÇ
https://medium.com/invisible-lab/save-thousands-of-dollars-in-solana-nft-giveaways-7d584de2e174

Although I tried to run this in my local environment, separately from my project, and for some reason it doesn't give me an error ü§®ü§î
metadata imported from @metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata btw
Hey guys, why do I get this error when I try to run Metadata.findDataByOwner()?
```console
accountInfo.amount = spl_token_1.u64.fromBuffer(accountInfo.amount);

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'fromBuffer')
```
My Current implementation is like this
1. Create transaction with instructions
2. Call serializeMessage
3. use nacl sign with server private key
4. Send the signature i got and serializeMessage as encoded base64
5. The in frontend the message is decoded and then created a Transaction object
Using Transaction.populate method
6. transaction.addSignature is called with server public key and signature from server
7. After adding signature the transaction object (tx) is passed to wallet's *signTransaction* 
8. this signed transaction is used for calling *tx.serialize()*

But i am getting this random signature verification error 
Thanks for the help
Is there anything wrong or anything to add in this approach?
if you don't use durable nonce, you can check is blockhash expired.
1.8 use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getfeecalculatorforblockhash
1.9 use https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#isblockhashvalid
there are two different things, for example, you want to buy some tokens and make a deposit (off chain) in a bank, after that our process (off chain) will detect your deposit and tell our Smart contract (just a simple call) to fetch the information from an API, that will fetch your deposit and send tokens (on chain) to your address
is there a go to crate
what is the best way to store a sha256 hash on chain? I am trying to avoid using a string
Hi if I increase the `confirmTransactionInitialTimeout` on the connection to 90s and it still timeouts due to congestion, can I for sure assume that the transaction failed?
it seems you can combine deposit some money and mint new token in one instruction in your custom program.
or you just want them separate?
I think remain the message is the same will be the key
a tx is composed by some signatures + a message
so it will more like
1. you composed a message and serialized it
2. you request everyone to sign the serialized message and get a signature
3. you composed signatures and message together
Okey Understood, then what should be better approach in this case?
Since the one signature is send from the server
yeah. I think just follow the command line's message. add `--allow-unfunded-recipient` to your command.
FYI https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/951298265037549649
maybe https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getaccountinfo
you can issue owned token and mint it what ever you want.
follow the steps https://solanacookbook.com/references/token.html#how-to-create-a-new-token
Any advice <@788215642070581289> would be awesome
in your `send` function, you get a recent blockhash then get signature.
after that you get a recent blockhash again
a recent blockhash is not always the same so if in your second times you get a different recent blockhash, your will get a signature verified failed because your message is totally different.
I know Chainlink offer a custom API but it's so expensive
that "fetch" from the smart contract is what we are not sure how to do it
So we think it's better if the smart contract fetch the information periodically or maybe based on an event (that can be done in backend securely) and the Smart contract get the users to deposit
We are trying to avoid the backend to send the instruction to the smart contract since it will require to store the private key in backend
What you mean to monitor it? My escenario is this: users deposit some money in a bank, we have a process that detects that deposit and create a record in a database with a pending state. What we want is the Smart Contract to read all pending states to mint new tokens for those users and send those tokens to them
I created a new walllet and a new token now I try to send my token to a phantom wallet but it gives me an error
Error: The recipient address is not funded. Add `--allow-unfunded-recipient` to complete the transfer
Is there an alternative to 'solana account' for checking the conent of an account ?
Hey guys, I have a lil question, how to airdrop USDC on devnet ? Thanks
is there in bug in serializeMessage ?
I am Using transaction returned by wallet's

Sometimes the serialize method runs successfully, sometimes it throws verification error
Since the error is very random, i am not able to figure out what is happening

as gidge say there is a integration maybe you can take a look https://solanacookbook.com/integrations/web3auth.html#social-logins-on-solana

with which @solana/web3.js function can we create a new Solana wallet?
just guessing when you sign tx, the serialized message is different.
just the short answer is fine, if it's possible I will do my due research:)
I did 0 web3 stuff so forgive me if I'm asking a stupid question but I can somehow request the owners public key aswell Im guessing ?
Great! Thanks
You can however do `new BN("10000000000000000000000000000000000000")` etc.
BN = big number, so yeah, it only works for numbers üòõ (in fact, specifically integers)
Since the discussion is locked, am not able find any solutions
not sure is there any service for this. but you can use https://solanacookbook.com/references/nfts.html#how-to-get-all-nfts-from-a-wallet to get all nfts in a wallet then request user to sign some your custom message and verify it.

If I try to base64 encode/decoe or base58 encode/decode "95/A2WN2S/UdTYpehTx6rV/JJfNHNpoAs4BT1jmS8Zs=" I get nothing that Solscan can recognize. Makes no sense.
Thank you for the advice!
Can someone please help me figure out why it is saying that I have not credited my account even though the wallet (fromPubKey) has 3 SOL in it?
Hey guys I am trying to write a token swap program in dart and have an issue: When I create the liquidity account, I get this error: jsonrpc-2.0 error (-32002): Transaction simulation failed: Attempt to debit an account but found no record of a prior credit.
Here is my code:
List<encoder.Instruction> createLiquidityAccount = [
    SystemProgram.createAccount(
      pubKey: liquidityTokenAccount.address,
      fromPubKey: wallet.address,
      lamports: await solanaClient.rpcClient.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(
          TokenProgram.neededMintAccountSpace),
      space: TokenProgram.neededAccountSpace,
      owner: wallet.address,
    ).instructions.first
  ];

  print("Creating liquidity account");
  encoder.Message first = encoder.Message(instructions: createLiquidityAccount);
  String txHashLiquidity = await sendMessage(first, [
    liquidityTokenAccount,
    wallet,
  ]);
  print(txHashLiquidity);
Thanks, I told it to do base64 though and I've tried decoding it as base64
Yes, if they are open source you can see.... otherwise contact the author
Ok so in my case I am trying to deserialize the account data from a stake account created by lido when I unstake from their pool.

So my best bet would be to check how their program is serializing the data and reversing that process?
You need to look at the program to see how it is serializing data to the account(s) you are fetching. Once you know that you can deserialize
where metadataAccounts is the response
return metadataAccounts.map((metadataAccountInfo) => (
    bs58.encode(metadataAccountInfo.account.data)
  ));
is there any way to see how much space has been allocated to an account info?
i have a bad feeling that account_info.data_len just returns the len of the non-zero data in the account
Yes, the code I posted above has the creator_address for the degods collection in it. It's returning data but the data doesn't seem to consist of token addresses.
That would be wonderful. I've already tried the code posted on Stack Overflow but can't get anythign to work.
I can dm you the code if you want
Yeah, I worked it out. The problem was that i was using the method for candymachinev1 when trying to get the program accounts of a candymachinev2
Hey folks üëã anyone able to give me a little advice on how to deserialise the data  in an Account returned by `get_program_accounts_with_config`  method?
its the collection already minted?
I'm trying to do that same thing in javascript. Let me know if you have any luck.
"error": {
                "code": -32600,
                "message": "Sliced account data can only be encoded using binary (base 58) or base64 encoding."
            },
I get an error when I do that.
Ye it will only return minted nfts
You can use `encoding: 'jsonParsed'`
But the data doesn't seem to be a base64 encoded token address.
An example of the data returned looks like this...

{
    "account": {
        "data": [
            "95/A2WN2S/UdTYpehTx6rV/JJfNHNpoAs4BT1jmS8Zs=",
            "base64"

Hello. If I use `solana_program::ed25519_program` to verify signed messages, I need to somehow restrict people from using the same signature multiple times. In Solidity I could create a mapping and set the signature value to `true` to do this, but since Solana has no mappings, there must be another way. 
The easiest way I can think of is to create a PDA for each signed tx, but there has to be a smarter way.
Hello. I have an error 413 when submitting my project to ecosystem. What is wrong? Who can help me?

Sharing my code for sending custom SPL tokens. I've struggled with this for hours, so I hope it helps others. Cookbook is a little out of date, so I couldn't get it to work following it.

*Note: It assumes you've already minted your SPL tokens to* `sender_keypair.json`

```

Possible to read a transaction logs directly on-chain by programs?
hi, i've this error while creating an own spl token: RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x0 [3 log messages]

Any ideA ?
Hey there is way to refuse transaction in to a wallet own by a solana program ?
From a program perspective, you are limited at the moment to 10 MB per account so you'll actually want to separate each bank into it's own account which will simplify the program. If you need to keep information  centralized you can still designate one for that as well. The issue will be that you'll need to pass the accounts into the instruction that operates on them.
Can someone help me with this please?
yeah, after 7 or 8 attempts it finally went through...
maybe it was just a network congestion or smth, but the dev experience has been terrible ;p
hi,
by anchor client I can send any number to program
`program.rpc.initialize(new anchor.BN(1234)`

but when I try to send any string it is not possible anymore
`program.rpc.initialize(new anchor.BN("1234".toString())`
why?
yeah, its a pretty centralized blockchain, but thats the nature of proof of stake
Anyone can suggest a good PAID RPC Service for mainnet? Thanks
Just figure out that I can try to read account db directly without `ledger-tool`, thanks for the info.
i wonder what they will do to make it scale then? the more expensive it is the less validators, and the slower the network
Can the deployer wallet for a contract be changed to a different wallet? Ie. can someone else have full control access to the contract?
I have a quick question regarding solana tokens
You need some pretty beefy hardware. Plus if you want to be a full validator node, you need quite a lot of solana delegated to your validator in order to be chosen as the block leader, which is needd to be profitable.
what does it cost to run a validator?
<@525758014150672405> sorry, I went to bed and didnt see your responses. I sent a friend requests to DM if you want to see more of my code.
Hello! thank you for the response, and sorry for the late reply (had to sleep). I thought `getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount` will create the TokenAccount on the receiver wallet if it doesnt exist there. After more debugging, it seems calling `getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount` for the receiver is the line that's throwing the `TokenAccountNotFoundError` ü§î

The cookbook creates the TokenAccount for the receiver like this:
```
//get the token account of the toWallet Solana address, if it does not exist, create it
  const toTokenAccount = await mint.getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo(
    toWallet.publicKey,
  );
```

But since `Token` doesn't exist anymore, I'm calling `getOrCreateAssociatedAccountInfo` directly from the library like this, which is throwing the error:
```
  const receiverTokenAccount = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
    connection, // connection
    senderKeypair, // payer
    tokenPublicKey, // mintPublicKey (token public key)
    receiverPublicKey // receiver
  );
```

Any suggestions?
Just looked at the geyser plugins, it is not my need since I am trying to get all the account in the account db.
Hi there, is there a way for me to request transaction signatures from a specific program pubkey like this one ? https://solscan.io/account/MEisE1HzehtrDpAAT8PnLHjpSSkRYakotTuJRPjTpo8
thanks
Yeah, look at the account db to get all accounts in the db, but it loads all into memory that causes OOM kill.
you can make CPI/Cross program invocation calls - from within a program. if that is what you mean. 
https://solanacookbook.com/references/programs.html#how-to-do-cross-program-invocation
did you look at the asccount db or geyser plugins?
were you able to do anything?  says it was upgraded?
Hi, I am trying to export the accounts table from snapshot via `solana-ledger-tool accounts --no-account-data > accounts.yaml`. But currently, 128G RAM instance is not enough anymore so it occurs OOM kill. Is there a way not to load all accounts into memory for index to export the accounts table?
Do you know how to run another contract from a contract?
Basically it's multi-tenancy. A bank with multiple branches. How can we achieve multi tenancy with Solana?
Can someone help me understand how solana validates a block? What does it to do determine that a block is valid and not malicious?
Hello all, here is my case I want to use Solana.

Can someone help me with how to get all the transactions of an account using web3?
BRruaeiRT6Z54nKSXffCsZDSEfAgFHH5XfNCCNEWBYHG
Whats the best path towards broadcasting my own transactions? (Eth, for instance -> erigon node with rpc + ethers.js -> nodejs) Does running your own node (is that possible?) increase the probability that a transaction will get mined? If running your own node is possible, can you share a machine running erigon mainnet with a solana node?
whats your program address in main?   perhaps im not being clear.
temporary account = the one that has been created when the deployment failed (to which I recovered the key)
program account - I should have SOL in my program account? that's new. I thought that only fee payer (update authority) has to have funds. it always had been like that:
`Balance: 0.00114144 SOL`
and it's the same on devnet and it still works. so I must be misunderstanding something
Does anyone here know anything about `@qru/MetaFlex` npm package? I've tried looking but can't find any docs or examples

i believe in yall :-)
And thank you so much for liking it üôÇ
I'm kinda swamped hahahahaha but I have 3 friends working with me in this one, I believe (and want so bad) we can make this work in Solana
oh you should be fine! as long as you arent swamped with other stuff anyway :p 
i say go for it, solana is really cool and your project sounds fun to me
i am not experienced with this and there may be an easier way. however theres something called blockchainapi that provides some data enrichment for querying solana. i used it for something else and thought it worked great.

to me it seems like this query would suit your needs
https://docs.blockchainapi.com/#tag/Solana-Transaction
Great, I'll look for the differences between the two, thank youuuu
Yeah... I'm thinking a lot about deadlines. I have until december to make a working thesis, which could be simple so I think I'll give myself like a month to decide if I make this work on Solana
can anyone help with this ?
oh the other thing i would recommend is that you use `anchor-client-gen` and not `@project-serum/anchor` for your TypeScript code
you mentioned this was for a thesis -- if you are working on a deadline for school or something you might want to build this on a chain that uses the ethereum virtual machine. im not an expert but as i understand it there are ones that dont have as high of transaction fees. i think solana is going to be more worth learning and have the best career opportunities (thats why im chatting you now instead of hanging out in some other chain discord) but the time to get started is definitely longer
Oh nice, i'll join them aswell
just be warned that anchor changes a lot and documentation and educational materials are generally not as mature on solana at all compared to ethereum. there will be struggles! the anchor discord is very helpful, at this point i usually go there and not here if i can.
Perfect! I'll look into the anchor book, thank you so much!!!
<@!170627885181304832>
haha just checking :p i didnt want to send you on a wild goose chase. 
you can probably find some good writing about how accounts work in solana, since that is maybe the biggest difference between solana's programming model and ethereum's or normal server programming.
but in terms of tutorials the ones in the anchor book are probably best?
I'm actually a senior full stack dev, just have absolutely no knowledge on blockchain hahahaha
Thank you!
https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/tutorials/tutorial-0.html#clone-the-repo
i think that you should maybe start by doing an anchor tutorial, though I really don't have good advice here, sorry. solana is tough to learn. what is your experience level with programming in general?
Hey guys, is there an easy way to switch between different solana cli versions? I see that are all installed in `~/.local/share/solana/install/releases` just cant see an easy way to switch?
Nah, the data won't change that much
the only exception is if failure depends on data that is changing a lot
Can you recommend me any links to specific docs I should read? Most of what I've found in the solana docs is currency-related, which - i think - does not suit me well, right?
furthermore, users can generally always tell if their transaction will fail before they actually send it
yes -- you can always just make a transaction fail if certain constraints are not met, in which case it will do nothing (but still be recorded to the blockchain)
Oh, is it possible to make this validation? That'll be awesome
this sounds perfectly doable and like a fun starter project :-) 

it is impossible to do these transactions without paying SOL, all transactions have fees. however, they are extremely low, fractions of a cent. aside from transaction fees, you also have to spend in order to save data to the blockchain. depending on how you architect things, this could add up a little (but this would be paid by users). lastly, it will probably cost you a few hundred dollars to deploy this program to the blockchain. 

sending two transactions -- one for the vote data, and one for the vote itself -- seems a little pointless. instead, you can just make the first transaction fail if the vote is invalid (because the user already voted, etc)
I'm sorry if that sounded confusing, English is not my first language and I'm no specialist in blockchain or Solana
Hey guys! Can anyone help me know if solana works for my thesis?

My objective is something like this: an online voting system like strawpoll.me using blockchain

What I wanted to do was:

1. the user logs into the platform, joins a poll and click on voting.
2. the backend tries to create a transaction to the blockchain (with metadata, and if there's any method that I can use to don't get charged by this let me know!) with the user data and the poll ID, which should be unique (to assure a user can only vote once per poll), if that succeeds (it's the first and only time the user is voting), I'll create another transaction that symbolizes the vote (but has no user data, only links the poll option to a vote)

Is something like that possible? I'd LOVE to use Solana

Also, as said above, if there's any method to create those transactions (purely based on data, no currency and such) without having to pay any SOL (this is a graduation thesis, won't be used for commercial purposes)

PS: I've read some of the documentation and followed some tutorials on creating my on Token and such, but what I need is a way to send data that I could retrieve
the buffer account that im given the ability to recover has no lamports or history
there's some stuff about resuming deployment
my friend tells me this is some issue with the protocol post 1.18 + congestion. any solution knowers?
I keep getting `Error: Custom: Invalid blockhash` while trying to deploy my program to main net using `solana program deploy`
yeah, I guess, I'll try that
the code has written at cookbook. the example is 1) created a mint, 2) create token accounts , 3) mint it and 4) send it.
if you have an existing one, you can skip 1) and 3)
if your destination don't have a correspond token account, you need to 2) => 4)
<#763249718339567626>
I think it looks good. also you can check is the mint has a metadata or not.
also you can get a better support at <#937905165074300999>
can you show me an example please?
Hi, is there tutorials to develop on solana?
Hi all.
I'm looking for a distinction between nft and normal spl token using json rpc response.
Here is an example.
I have an account address abcdef, and want to know whether it is nft or solana token.
I'm trying to use getAccountInfo RPC and use deciamls, supply element to be a contition if (deciamls === 0 && supply === 1 ) { //it is nft }.
But I'm not sure I can use this as a perfect distinction.
just use token transfer and use your existing token's token account. the concept is the same
It doesn't say how to send an existing token
Also on solana cookbook it just says how to create a token and send it
I've tried something similar to the code above, and I always got some errors like token account not found or can't use some function like .toBase58() as something was undefined, and I couldn't find a solution
can you send me your full code please, I see that you are trying to send spl tokens as well?
look above for spl-token related docs and info. as well as solanacookbook.com.
generally listing what you actually tried helps.
Hey guys, how could I send someone an existing token through @solana/web3.js and spl-token?
I've found a few examples online, but none of them seemed to work for me
you may want to create and make sure the accounts exist before doing the transfer if your getting an err like that.
what balance is sitting in your deployed program? not sure what u mean by temporary account.
when deploying, for various reasons, its been common to need about half or more of the balance sitting in your program data account.  if you verify you have a little over that in your account thats deploying,  than it should not be related to that.  a 'temp account?' does not count towards any funds afaik.   if you can prove that to yourself at least you should be able to rule that out..   but generally u will not get any Fee payer related messages that are not actually relevant, as much as anyone like to say otherwise. its 98% that most of the time. the other issue could just be failing because of congestion. and to just keep trying. especially if your same setup has been working recently.
hmm.. I'm getting a `TokenAccountNotFoundError` from this code. Do you see anything wrong with my code?
I had 10 SOL when I started, now I have ~6 (as the rest of it sits in the temporary account)
this is more than enough to make a program udate (which I've done many times by now using the same script)
I'll take a look, thank you!
insufficient fee payer generally means that, at least..   your sure theres enough in there?   I know, you, should know this already tho üôÇ
ahh. if your looking for the new way, did you check the latest version in the spl-token docs?  https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/token/js/
based on your needs a transfer, or transfer instruction for a transaction should do the trick.
hmm, you mean solanacookbook.com, right? I'm looking at the `How to send SPL-Tokens` section, but they reference `Token`
hey
I've been trying to deploy a program on mainnet for a while now, but I'm still getting transaction errors
either this
```
Error: Data writes to account failed: Custom error: Max retries exceeded
Error: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds
```
or this
```
Error: Deploying program failed: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds
```

I've gone through key recovery and redeployment a couple of times, but it always fails.
is there something wrong with mainnet?
devnet works fine
you mentioned you have 1gig, maybe..  it needs more. im not sure on your setup. but available actual ram at your disposal needs to be min 2GB+ in my exp. I dont run anything with less than 4gb, and thats on a weak tester.
you dont see anything under the tokens section?
So it is strictly physical ram, and I can't use vram as a work around?
instead of minting them first, because theyre already minted
I've been looking at the cookbook, but not quite getting how to get the references when I have the keypair.json with the tokens I want to send
Typically with token it‚Äôs like token.createMintInstructions. If you look through the docs you‚Äôll find an equivalent
We‚Äôre just SPL-Token 0.2.0 friends living in a SPL-Token 0.1.8 world
Token was just a wrapper more oriented toward keypairs. you can just use the normal transfer methods.  you familiar with Solana cookbook?
oh :O do you have a suggesstion for a workaround with the new version? I'm trying to send a custom spl-token from my wallet to another
the latest spl-token has been updated.  token may not be there anymore after a restructure.

this is about available ram.  not swap size.
anyone know why I cant import `Token` from `@solana/spl-token`? in nodejs
thats not enough.   you will need more like 3gb, 2gb might squeek by.
The vm has either 500m or 1 gig of ram, swap shhould be acting as vram if I'm not mistaken
generally not able to compile is related some kind of ram issue, or cargo build threads.. which tends to be memory/ram related.   If by swap you mean some kind of VM there may be something related to that.  this err almost always points back to ram.
It was installed today, I figure a fresh build might help
its just about troubleshooting.
is your rust up to date?    i believe there was a rust update not too long ago for related code bases.
I saw some unanswered questions
did you search discord for the error?  this looks familiar.
<@785084693023424542> Rust is installed and my swap size is 10 gig
Oh thanks. Didn't know there was a special channel for them.

thanks. these are generally best reported in <#812122623654887444>
I learned that if you mint a nft that you (your account ID ?)  have to be listed in the metadata as a creator. And I seen that you can allow people to "mint" nfts that already have a set metadata.

am I correct on this ?

also if I am correct then another question im wondering is how do you retrieve the sol payment that was given when someone "mints" your NFT.

does it automatically get transferred to the creator account?
What format are those strings in? Don't think you'll be able to just directly pass them to Uint8Array like that
in the puppet program  from (https://book.anchor-lang.com/chapter_3/CPIs.html) i was curious what would happen if i tried to modify the puppet account  from the pupper master:

```rust

index c26d77c..2324ea4 100644

         Ok(())
     }
 }

observed behavior: basically ignores the added lines by me, the solana runtime doesn't allow puppet master to modify the puppet account state. program runs fine and exits successfully.
what i expected: some kind of error? any particular reason this case is silently ignored vs throwing an explicit Error?
Hi guys, I heard you found a solution against bot by "censoring" txs or something like this, will it be worth ? already tried on testnet or something ? would be huge to have our solana before bot era :p

Was there a chat about the top TX spammers?
Thanks, got you. I prefer native Rust, however override packing/unpacking using borsh serializer.
usually estimate the size and use a buffer (extra), and take this into account with allocating initial size and minimum rent and creating/initializing the account.
if using native rust you can reference cookbook example and the solana and spl source for further space setup and considerations and allocating initialize size:
https://solanacookbook.com/guides/serialization.html#serializing-data

for anchor they have other shortcuts to help define initial space.
on your can subscriptions:  anything prefixed with ' on
https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/
just ask. if no answer. try yourself. and try again later. best bet.
Suppose I want to store the following data in my account 
```rust
struct Foo {
    name: String,
    items: Vec<u8>,
}
```
Initially both `name` and `items` are empty . Later I want to assign `name` with some string and add elements to the `items`. However, we need to allocate enough space for data. What is the idiomatic (or correct) way to implement it? I know `AccountInfo` has `realloc` method. I use this method, however I'm not sure what the best practice is.
Hi I would like to monitor every single tx that occurs on certain program ID.

yo mates, i need some help with my project is there someone available?
the same recommendations. many listed more recently above. there is a retry section in the cookbook and we will probably be releasing more soon.
i dont recall there is a way to do this all in 1 line or 1 command as is.

How can I enter seed phrase in the first line itself without waiting for prompt?
Best way to send a transaction nowadays? Since there‚Äôs a lot of congestion.
great, thanks a lot for your help!!
i do not recall the current reasoning. it may have something to do with the deploy buffer requiring space to be used temporarily based on your overall deployment size. it is something I have noticed, as a potential reason a deploy on main may fail. Checks and optimizations have been changing and improving.  I am not aware of a method to check re-deployment cost, but for now only initial deploy for the rent charged would be deducted.  subsequent deploys should only charge transaction fees, and would not actually charge again for rent.  if the deployment hangs up or fails you may notice the SOL requested missing, and this could be due to the deployment buffer being used temporarily, that can be closed to reclaim your SOL being used for the deployment
but funds are not taken then? Why checking the funds?
Hiiii! who do I get in contact with in regards to helping uild this project??? Or rather any open source projects in general
if your deploying in general, the funds in the account deploying are checked - if you do not have something like half the funds or more in the deploying account, it may fail to deploy and say insufficient funds.
okay, thanks
its based on how you compose transactions, and you design and scenario. wallets, keypairs, and so forth. the details matter. you can check and see how sendAndConfirmTransaction works in web3 and apply it based on your needs.  By default it takes signers, which are generally from a keypair and not a wallet. When you send a transaction you want its signature from the initial sending result so you can track it.  You can query it with getSignatureStatus, and get confirmed/other, among others, as needed.
guys, quick one: re-deploying a program on devnet takes almost zero sol (just gas), but on mainnet my transaction is failing and asking for 2.5 sol... is that normal?
hmmm, okay, but what about all the minting sites.
For example the candy machine ui examples, they all have some kind of function to await confirmation, but I don't really understand how exactly they work
if it is successful it should return with no error. it is based on commitment, like confirmed or finalized, in terms how the level of confirmation you desire. if it completes in good time it will return the result back with no error. if an error is returned, it would have more info.
would it be able to tell tho, if the transaction was successful?
the basic setup should work.  wallet-adapter tab as the wallet based version.
https://solanacookbook.com/references/basic-transactions.html#how-to-send-sol
What's the best way to make a function which would wait for transaction confirmation?

This was the most I could fit in one transaction.  I can see why the transaction fee mechanism is so insufficient.  All that work and still paying only 0.00005 SOL fee.

Hey guys, looks like `getMultipleAccounts` is no longer supported? https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#getmultipleaccounts

Hi guys, this is probably a dummy question but what would be the proper way to add an extra fee when a user transfer to another user? I can make them to send the money to the company account, keep some fee there and send the rest but that means paying two transactions, are there alternatives to do this?
instead of getSlot, it's better to use ws and `slotsubscribe` for your case I guess
use `getSlot` (get current slot) and `getTransaction` (get slot of the tx) endpoints

Hello there! Now that Solana is slow, I wanted to implement a way to see the confirmations of a transaction, like Solflare has. Is there an RPC call for that?
where can i find more information about multisigs? I've been searching the docs and this discord, but wasnt able to gather enough information to full understand how they work. I'm particularly interested in replicating what exchanges seem to be doing - being able to sweep users funds w/o the need of the receiving address to hold SOL. I guess SOL for the fee is provided via a wallet with one of the signatures, but I'm having hard time wrapping it all together how to construct such setup.
i believe you'll have to do that manually
I batch a bunch of instructions into one transaction, and the transaction is too large. Is there a way to split the instructions array so that I have a minimum of transactions of a valid size?
Devnet was working for me earlier and I don't think there's any issues atm, can you connect on other wallets? Maybe check phantom support
I think it is a feature from anchor, maybe check https://book.anchor-lang.com/chapter_5/cli.html?highlight=verify#verify
not sure what you mean? I think the transaction won't be very complicated. after you get a transaction from the api, you can parse instructions and inner instructions to get program id
I'm not able to connect to devnet
Still stuck
Hi guys, - https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#gettransaction returns an `EncodedTransaction` rust object, but its very annoying to work with - is there anyway to convert it to something easier - i just need program_id of the instructions in a transaction
can pleaze someone check this out? seems that there's a problem with log subscription
Hi everyone, how do I get the verifiable build status for my contract on the block explorer?
Whatever program you are calling, it checks that the accounts you send in with the instruction are owned by the program. The error is telling you that one of the accounts is not owned by itself. You should look at the source code of the program to determine what you need to send.
Hey guys anyone able to assist with this error ?

The aim is to give proper context for users using solscan or other tools

Can we add a custom name for transaction instruction ?
Or is it possible with programs deployed on chain?

for an anchor program, it will hash func name and put the first 8 bytes in an instruction data. 
for normal program, there is no idea about func name.
how to get their name on chain?
I think you need to connect them (like solscan). actually your instruction don't have a name on chain. it shows a correspond name by decoding your instruction data.
maybe https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/517163444747894795/961647902583824384

actual transaction size itself has limitations based on many factors and design. some of them may involve protocol limitations.
is the ssc rpc not useable anymore?
does solana have any plans to increase its txn size?
Thank you!
if the command fails it just was not properly installed most likely, or missing rust or some dependency. you can just try installing again. you may need to install dependencies. it would likely error out on install if it was not installed correctly.
keep in mind its very different than eth. its stateless design. you have to pass in all data you require to interact with including accounts you want to modify or access. programs are loaded and executed on demand and have finite compute limits. cost and performance  or cheap and fast so memory and cpu have to be taken into consideration.
thank you
Thank you, if the command fails, do I have to remove spl-token-cli before trying to install again?
https://solanacookbook.com/references/programs.html#how-to-do-cross-program-invocation
Good evening, at the moment I'm just studying solana and I have a question. Is it possible to interact in any way within your Rust program with another public program on the blockchain? For example, in solidity this is easy to implement, but in solana I can not find information about it.
just type `spl-token` and you will see the commands.  try `--help` to see some commands. and you can reference the spl docs. https://spl.solana.com/
Is there a command to verify spl-token-cli installed correctly?
According to the Associated Token Account docs:
> If the associated token account for a given wallet address does not yet exist, it may be created by anybody by issuing a transaction containing the instruction returned by create_associated_token_account.

How do I check if an account exist? I tried googling and searching solana_sdk docs, I couldn't find any way to do this.
Or is create_associated_token_account idempotent? Are we supposed to do it everytime we need an associated token account?
does solana have any plans to increase its txn size?

no, that's not our use case.....
THAT'S TERRIBLE
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????
well we have some clown that abandoned 10M SOL staked to a vote account on devnet.  Some might consider that "spent"
üòâ
I still remember 10 SOL at a time.....ah, those were the days.
OK - we'll figure out a different way forward with what we've been gifted.  Thanks Trent and co.
Ah man - I wouldn't call it abuse if it would be spent....but I do get what you're saying.
you think we're going to tell you how to abuse the faucet?
OK - well, any information on how the airdropped dev SOL is limited?  Is it through IP?  Wallet?  RPC? all of them?
"need" and 1M NFTs seems like a bit of a stretch
Fun times!
We need a fully independent NFT that is transferrable and sellable as a verified NFT on-chain.
gotcha.  no - I don't know if that would work in our specific instance (although the hidden settings NFT may be an instance of this....still not that sure of the mapping though.)

<@585868308419444749> - sorry - not familiar with the acronym.  What's an SFT?
I think that's a thing
Hey there is way to work or to handle more than 1000 accounts during the runtime, more specifcally be able to use function with these 1000 accounts ?
It's trying to mirror the process in Dev.  If there's no way to do it that's fine, but if there is a way to get 2045 SOL on DevNet I'd like to.
sounds like you really want an SFT?
I know, I know.  This is a battle I've had....and production wouldn't be an issue because he already has the SOL.
can you not test with 100 or 1000? not sure I see the need for testing with 1 million, per say.   why is 1 million some magic number?
They were free - was supposed to be until Christmas and then they went longer but not sure when they expected to be able to offer the service until.
I got blocked from them (for a different project)
Did the ssc RPC stop working?
And yes - I need an appt to check my sanity, but this was a very important requirement for my client.
So we have to pre-mint 1M NFTs
With Hidden Settings it's not possible to do so because they append a sequential number to the name.
Want to randomize between 1 and 1M.
<@785084693023424542> it is to be able to randomize a hidden settings candy machine NFT upon demand
genesys go has a dev public one:
https://psytrbhymqlkfrhudd.dev.genesysgo.net:8899/
I'm currently using `https://api.devnet.solana.com`. Do you know of another rpc for devnet?
not dev sol, its only local validator sol.  you would need to set things up for local program wise for any that do not yet exist. possibly others have done this setup.    still not clear on your need to 1 Million NFTs?
Where are you getting your cost from?
candy machine then it's 0.01197 SOL
<@793009052879028254> using the Candy Machine or some other method?
each account is preloaded
localnet starts you with lots of SOL if I remember correctly
And when I did try Figment I got the rate limit message.
How do I get 2045 SOL?  And just spin up a local validator on my machine here, and that would allow me to supply as much dev SOL as I want?  Sorry for that question. but not sure how that would be different from calling the airdrop command from an RPC like Figment
try a different RPC
the cost to mint an NFT is higher, it's `0.01197` SOL
your first option is a local validator.  not sure on your path for requiring so much.  what the use case for needing to mint 1 Million NFTs?
we minted several - the cost of the minted NFT is 0.00204428.  But to get to 1M NFTs...well, 0.00204428 SOL * 1M is A LOT OF SOL!  So....what are our options?
I know it's nuts.....and we just need to cover the minting fees, not the cost of the NFT
Need a supply of 1M NFTs
local validator, for one. whats your use case for dev where u need that much
Is it gated by IP address?  Wallet address?  RPC?  all 3?
Hey folks!  If we need a bunch of Devnet SOL (like way more than 24/day) what are our options?
anyone have a clue on how i could work around this?
have tried solana cli version 1.9.9, 1.9.12, 1.9.13 with no luck
thanks. when I run `solana logs` I don't see the corresponding messages in the function appearing there, so I'm guessing the call is failing before it even gets into the function I'm expecting to be executed.
trying to deploy to devnet but i keep hitting this issue `Error: Custom: Invalid blockhash`
Hey guys, can anyone help me with sending requests to the solana json rpc
Maybe just bad luck, otherwise if possible maybe share the whole code and maybe we find something suspicious
generally just `wss://`  followed by the rpc url. based on provider. like above
what is the websocket endpoint for mainnet?
```
    let rpc_url = "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com".to_string();
    let ws_url = "wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com".to_string();
```
Well for me it works with 1.37.1 in the NodeJS REPL
```js
s = require('@solana/web3.js')
c = new s.Connection(s.clusterApiUrl('mainnet-beta'))
c.getAccountInfo(new s.PublicKey('...')).then(console.log)
c.getParsedAccountInfo(new s.PublicKey('...')).then(console.log)
```
it actually is sometimes working now so thats an improvement

correct
Can someone help me query the actual json rpc? I'm trying to do it through python requests
For some reason it's giving me this error: 
```json
{'code': -32602, 'message': 'Invalid params: invalid type: map, expected a string.'}
```
I've tried both sending the data in as json and converting it to string as well, and nothing seemed to work
yup
And the account key you provided earlier exists?^^
Web3 is the import and web3Client a Connection?
But otherwise looks correct to me. It worked with 1.37.0?
nope still doesnt work
is this the right channel?  thank you!
apologies if this is the wrong channel, but i am trying to find where to look for support on my admittance to the Solana hackathon later this April
should be getAccountInfo not getParsedAccountInfo? I think
I think I just caught it
```ts
  getAccountInfo(account: string): Promise<RpcResponseAndContext<AccountInfo<Buffer | ParsedAccountData>>> {
    return this.web3Client.getParsedAccountInfo(new Web3.PublicKey(account), 'confirmed');
  }```
I have a suspicion, please share your code. <@337074973791485953>
anyone can help? same error with ts
or is there a parameter or something Im missing
which version should I be using
GetAccountInfo returns null for me using web3js 1.37.1
is that what you we're looking for?
here is my wallet address for the hello world attempt https://explorer.solana.com/address/J6eLH6tKmTeHtukFAbax6gDvBZkb5nEUyT1uTNwWRfFY (ignore last 2 transactions) but everything from today before then is trying to upload
do you have a url to any failed transaction history?
or any link to logs or anything someone case use as a tracking reference?
python library ^
Hi, maybe I'm doing it wrong, but seems that log subscription isn't working, I'm not getting any new transaction (tried with the signer address, contract address and tokens address too)
I've added some prints in the solana library to debug it and seems that is passing the data in the right way (last screen, first line the data sent, second the response)
i've went back to cli version 1.19.14, and trying to deploy hello world but same error, it's weird, it's get to like 1-5 transactions pending and then fails
im able to deploy.  have you tried a different program or an example program to test?  in the past using previous CLI were successful for some.
are there any good rules of thumb for time for a transaction to become processed, confirmed, or finalized?
How about for probability of being confirmed given that it's processed, or probability of being finalized given that it's confirmed?
I‚Äôve been there too üòâ Guess we all have
Smart contracts, aka programs. Not sure why they are separated from rest of my program. 

I‚Äôve checked the dev-resources. The whole thing is a bit overwhelming. üòÖ
You as external developer mostly only put smart contracts on the blockchain.
No not even that üòâ You trigger these actions via the blockchain. See eg https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api
Thanks. So, from the first take, I mostly deploy my code that is dependent on the blockchain, into the blockchain. Eg: making transactions, user wallet related stuff etc. i guess. üòÖ
But as a first hint, you do none of it ON the blockchain. These kind of things still need to be on ‚Äûclassic‚Äú infrastructure/servers.
If you‚Äôre keen to keep your complete app decentralized there are some approaches.
Mastodon also requires servers, what makes it decentralized is that these servers form a P2P network and are owned by multiple people/ companies without dependencies to each other.
i've got 6 RPCs, some private, unfortunately all have same experience
ah, did. not realise it was meant to be used with solana program, thanks will try it next time it fails üëç
you could try a different RPC as well.  nodes do fall behind, fork, or have to catch up, based on which one is hit.
might be because its not how to call it.  did you mean `solana program write-buffer`?   use `--help`
i'm trying ` solana write-buffer ` but it says 
`error: Found argument 'write-buffer' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context`
-
what version of the CLI should we be using?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

but I don't think they'll reveal this info üòÑ
<@182296047052259338> is still not working. I have same 403 error
Could get it from the transaction instruction:
https://github.com/sbnair/Solana_Token/blob/main/token/program/src/instruction.rs#L37
you should find a magic eden support channel. what you're trying to do is specific to their contract
<@182296047052259338> thank you!
Is there anyone who's able to figure out how to generate some specific account? I'm trying to send BUY transaction to Magic Eden and can't figure out one account üòÑ it looks like a PDA account or something which changes with buyer address and token mint address
Try this version. If it doesn't work use this workaround.

How do I get the type of transaction? e.g `mint/sell/buy`?
Hello. I`m getting this error on Tool install. Anyone got the same issue? My machine is a Debian 11.
I have 10gb memory on my laptop..I guess that's not enough to build source?

```
 collect2: fatal error: ld terminated with signal 9 [Killed]
```
I think I need to listen to onLog event. Seems it returns transactions logs. But there should be some examples in docs on this. Nothing at all.
Is it better to attempt to _resume_ the deployment, or start from scratch?
It just keeps failing on timeouts when it gets to be 90% of the way there.
I'd try changelog for anchor-cli at 0.22
I'm unsure where to find an official doc on this change
yvw
Thank you
dunno if they're still doing that
in fact, ME was getting into trouble with FOSS devs for simply transferring ownership of token accounts üôÇ rather than transfer token/s and then close og account
there is not a 1:1 relationship here
Yes

a sec, this is my go-to but there are other better ones probably like solana cookbook
Armani (anchor dev) made us all write why we're using unchecked accounts, it's a meme now
I mean what‚Äôs the process? What do I use? And how do I know the transaction signature? Can you direct me to a guide maybe?

I‚Äôm using solana web3.js.
Let's say there is a game where a user (wallet A) stakes lamports on a global account B, and if they beat a record score the account A is rewarded. Firstly I thought it could possible to have this global mutable account with data associasted with it (for storing the max score) so I used an instance of AccountInfo<'info, MyData>. I saw that the account B received lamports but when I tried to send lamports back using B as a transaction signer I got "from must not carry data". Now I use the wallet of the "program owner" with an additional account for holding that "record score" and it works. But the way to declare a wallet for receiving lamport I found is this:     #[account(mut)]
    /// CHECK:` need this justification line to compile
    pub program_wallet: UncheckedAccount<'info>, and I'm doubtful it's ok

Error: Transaction was not confirmed in 30.66 seconds. It is unknown if it succeeded or failed. 

Is there any way to make the transaction confirmation last longer?
RPC probably, via whatever sdk? or curl üôÇ
if you want to test, it depends where in the release cycle you are
btw, you can do this on a localnet?
How can I get live transactions data through websocket like the screenshot?

I think I need to pass the wallet address to `onAccountChange` event and listen to it. But then how do I get the transaction details such as was it a `mint, sell, buy` etc.?
this will do it
while :

do

anchor deploy
sleep 3600

done

save the above code to a file called deployplz.sh then run sudo chmod +x deployplz.sh then run ./deployplz.sh
a sec
that said, a redeploy after success is negligible cost with 0 change to codebase
that said the real trick here is that this becomes more difficult if you want it to stop after successful deploy haha

üôÇ this was my first and I think still only significant contribution to metaplex, allowing candy machine config unused rent to go back to the og authority via this process
The conceptual thing is that in solana, every account has a "program owner", which is the program that's allowed to mutate the account's data and spend the account's money (the owning program is the only thing that can do this‚Äînothing else can). So if an account is owned by your program, it's up to your program to directly move the lamports itself‚Äîyou can't ask the system program to do it for you because the system program doesn't own the account!
No, presumably account B is owned by your own program (is it one of your `#[account]` structs?), in which case *you* need to move the lamports yourself, using `.try_borrow_mut_lamports()` etc.
Gotcha, that's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
Hi, I came accross the following situation when learning Anchor: I transfer lamports from account A to B when the latter has data associated with it, but when trying send lamports back the runtime error " Transfer: `from` must not carry data" occurs. Now, I guess I need to have this B account as pure "wallet" with no data associated to it. I didn't find a wrapper for "Wallet" type in Anchor. For now I use an instance of UncheckedAccount<'info> type which seems to work, but I'm quite sure it is a good practice   coding. Any suggestions here ?
The only possible way to sign for a PDA's address is by asking its deriving program to do so for you, via `invoke_signed` (so, in particular, it's impossible to sign for a PDA from the client ==> impossible for the client create an account there without asking the deriving program to do it)
Creating an account in solana requires that the *address* of the account sign (small asterisk here, but for keypair addresses and program-derived addresses this is how things work)
Interestingly, yeah, you have to ask your program to CPI to the system program on your behalf
Hey all, had a question about how PDA accounts are created. I know that you can use `findProgramAddress` to find a valid PDA address on the client via a seed and a program ID. But what's the best way to actually create the account? Is there a function you can use on the client that will build an instruction and / or issue a transaction to a the system program that will create the PDA account? Or do you need to create the PDA account by invoking the system program on chain from your program?

i am creating script that generates metadata for my nfts
and im having trouble with it
i dont really understand js
and im following a tutorial that does it with images .png and i want to do it with gifs that are on .mp4
someone can help me?
Not sure, but each transaction requires a separate signature, so whether you can do that "at once" will depend on if your wallet supports it
Ok. Is there a tutorial where I can see how to sign multiple transactions with a wallet at once?
Any idea what I can do

hi, is it possible to sign a transaction in web3.js before sending it?
Does anyone know of a decent script to use to airdrop tokens from a list? Asking out of curiosity
Ah - think I found it. `AccountLoader`
How should I reference a zero_copy account in an Accounts Context?

```
#[account(zero_copy)]
pub struct MapAccount {
    data: [u8; 524288]
```

```
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateMap<'info> {
    pub createMap: Account<'info, MapAccount>
}

79  |     pub map: Account<'info, MapAccount>
    |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `anchor_lang::AccountSerialize` is not implemented for `MapAccount`
```
You can transfer to whatever account you want‚Äîit's transferring *from* an account (decrementing its lamports) that's tricky, since ultimately only the program that owns an account is allowed to decrement the account's lamports.
Any help? üò¢
One more question please, any user can transfer to a PDA or just the program?
Awesome!! Thank you!
Hi guys, I wonder where to host the frontend React app, considering security and scalability? AWS? Netlify?
Yeah, you can jam whatever instructions you want in there (within limits, can only fit so many in a single 1232 byte transaction)
Oh, I see using ‚Äúadd‚Äù, and that transaction can make two transfers for different users and pay the same fee?
Ah okay I had it in the wrong place...
```
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateMap<'info> {
    #[account(zero)]
    pub createMap: Account<'info, MapAccount>
}
```
Yeah, would look like
```.rs
#[account(zero_copy)]
pub struct BigAccount {
    pub stuff: [u8; 52000]
}
```
Yes I did that, in a second tx I wanted to set it up, mainly because I couldnt get it to accept data: [u8; 52000] as an Account type.
No, you can do multiple instructions in a single tx
Account's init'd via a CPI to the system program (e.g. anytime you use `init` from anchor) are limited to 10kb
So you say making two transactions? Right?
Yep, you will need to initialize it with a whole separate instruction issued from the client
And while I could create an account that large, getting it initialized was tripping me up. 
Yes exactly I have that working accepting an account, but then I was trying to initialize it. I'll have a think - thank you for your information.
Yep, that's what `#[account(zero_copy)]` is for, can search the anchor repo for examples
Yeah thats fine, I really just want a pointer to the location to read/write from.
No, you actually *can't do any deserialization at all* üòõ
Oh I see, I have to do the Serialize/Deserialize myself?
You have to use a "zero_copy" account, which leaves the account data where it came from rather than deserializing it to the stack or heap
Yeah, that won't work unfortunately, the solana stack is only 4kb (and even the heap is only 32kb). If you want to use a big account you can't use anchor's `#[account]` thing like that
Anyone knows why I get these error when I try to transfer a token ?
Getting really confused with this, according to Solana docs I can create accounts that are 10MB large, but when trying to create this one of 520Kb, I cannot get the program to even allocate this space in memory... Note at this point I'm not even touching an account, just trying to allocate this space somewhere. Allocating it direct to the Account failed, so just tried to create it in memory.

Executing this line fails:
```
let vec: Vec<u8> = vec![0; 524288];
```

But this succeeds:

```
let vec: Vec<u8> = vec![0; 1000];
```

I tried configuring my Account as follows, but Borche complains about deserializing this, which is very strange as there is nothing to deserailize, it should just be a pointer.

```
#[account]
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct MapAccountSt {
    data: [u8; 524288]
}

the trait bound `[u8; 524288]: Default` is not satisfied
the following implementations were found:
```

            lamports: rentRequiredForSpace,

I'm trying to iniitailize a large Vec in an existing Account which I created outside of the program (Not a PDA)

Can I not do this, is there a better way?

I am trying to swap a token using the Jupiter's official swap API sample (https://docs.jup.ag/jupiter-api/swap-api-for-solana), but the transaction fails.

Why does the error "Program returned error: invalid account data for instruction" happen? I checked the private and public key information several times and it is probably correct!

Note that the RPC endpoint https://ssc-dao.genesysgo.net/ in the official sample times out in 60.01ms in most cases, so I switched to https://solana-api.projectserum.com/. (I used the Jupiter's official api-arbs-bot as a reference)

I am just asking for ideas
What you would be a good approach to charge an extra fee to a user to make a transaction on our app?
Yeah, every transaction pays a fee
I suppose yes because it changes blockchain state right?
I want to avoid two transactions, sending the amount user -> user and also user -> company (extra fee)
I am looking a guy to add an extra fee to our users, let them transfer between them but add an extra fee for the company
Moving funds from program account to PDAs also pay fees?
does someone have some read about the patch 1.10.4 and the antibot system
Good evening, can I use only the information from the solscan site, create and send my transaction? Or repeat someone else's transaction with only data from the scan
docker and related images generally need configuration right. but im not sure on Solana. at least a compatible image. might check dockerhub for existing ones.
how would I configure it correctly
hmmm, about the former part
docker needs to be configured correctly and still run on supporting architecture, from what i recall.  some may have github docker images or instructions posted, dockerhub has some solana images. I have not tried any docker or configs as of yet.  
wormhole has some docker images as well, but Im not sure they are updated.
```solanalabs/solana``` image
I'm using docker here

local validator has some hadware requirements to run properly. 
m1 shouldnt get those tho..
building from source, or using rosetta worse case are work arounds, 
but i recall any mac m1 issues were supposed to be fixed a while ago.
guess that's because I'm on m1
okay getting ```Incompatible CPU detected```
```solanalabs/solana:stable``` this one ?
not that I am aware of, but there should be images floating around for running docker..  trying to recall where.
is there any documentation on running localnet on docker ?
it's just the network congestion
I need a lot of goerli to test the project for my team. The reward is 500usdt. If the gentleman has it, he can use @ me
this is what i am getting now

1) triple check the funding account, make sure it actually has enough funds
2) close all buffers
3) try again
Trying to deploy a program on mainnet beta and i am getting this error: Error: Account allocation failed: unable to confirm transaction. This can happen in situations such as transaction expiration and insufficient fee-payer funds
There was a problem deploying: Output { status: ExitStatus(unix_wait_status(256)), stdout: "", stderr: "" }.
from a client?  when your serializing just manually serializing and the byte length/size is generally a quick approach to getting a good idea where your at. depends on your setup and implementation. In any case its just the actual bytes. so however you can calculate that on your end.   in program its just doing the same, based on data size.  afaik there is no tool or func that does this
I mean instruction_data space
Hello. Is there a formula I can use to calculate my transaction size? Because max is 1232 bytes, and I don't know how to  calculate left-over instruction space. Thank you.
Okay great! Much appreciated. Going to give it a shot tomorrow üôÇ Hope you have swell day <@785084693023424542>  :D\
based on current rules you can try and see what happens. if its auto rejected for a rule violation just change your approach.  the problem with deletes/edits of actual address/symbol is can be hard to verify or validate with the approach taken. there has not been a best practice afaik. for starters you could try adding the new token with a pr separately, and or/try editing the other, and submit. if you get an error file an issue. would pursue any further comms in the github, as the maintainers dont answer or maintain from here.
So would it be ideal to just change(Edit) the Token Address from the original Pull request. Btw thanks for the response, really appreciate it
awesome thank you very much! I will check all of these out
my hope is this list is deprecated soon. there is no best way afaik. attempting to make edits and filing an issue, is what I would suggest.

good thorough review of hello program walkthrough and concept:

Does anyone have good resources for an introduction to Programs? I've done the hello world example but no idea how to expand past it. <#763249718339567626> provides good documentation but some things seem out of date or not focused on Program creation
sounds like you can just cast a new PublicKey("public key string").  otherwise hard to say without seeing what your trying to do.
how do i get a publickey object from a string given that the string is in base58 in JS?
Hey guys, hope you all doing well. 

Looking for the best practice in removing an existing token on the Solana Tokenlist and replacing it with a new one.

Is it possible to remove all Meta data ect... on an existing token? Should i make 2 seperate pull requests to do so?

Thanks so much team üôÇ
yay, was just able to do it, can confirm that it works
ok it seems to be possible, i'll try to play with it: https://forums.solana.com/t/trying-to-controll-who-pays-the-fee/4194/2
hey, when doing a token transfer from account A (which doesn't have SOL) is it possible to utilize `fee_payer` to be a wallet B that has SOL? I saw token transfers that occurred from an account with 0 SOL balance, those transfers had 2 signatures though, but I'm still not entirely clear on the details if there's any specific setup that's needed for this or not.
Much appreciated once again
Also you can take a look to the Encode Solana series https://www.eventbrite.com/e/technical-overview-of-solana-tickets-293259235267
rust is best for programs (smart contracts) and the only real affective way to code and learn programs atm. 
you can use other languages for building clients (javascript, .net, python), but for programs I would just start learning rust.
freecodecamp and youtube, in addition to the rust lang book are great resources to get started.
