                "content": "Thank you very much for your answer! Yesterday I puzzled over this question for a long time :). I think you got the point right. The only thing is that I will clarify a couple of points. I write a \"hello word\" that simply counts the number of calls to it from users and stores their value in a separate PDA account for each user. Accordingly, in theory, it is not necessary for us in the client part to know and transmit the address of this PDA account (since it is derived from the program ID and the client's address). I would like the program to check itself whether an account has already been created for this user and, if not, then create it. Therefore, I am thinking how to make the most convenient API for the client. In this case, the absence of address derivation on the client side is implied.",
