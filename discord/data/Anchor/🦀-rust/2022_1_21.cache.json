                "content": "If `Rc` was used so that the types could be `Clone` in the case `Signer` can't be, I think something similar can just be accomplished by changing the constraint to `S: Borrow<Signer>`, and then doing an `impl<S> Clone for Config<S> where S: Borrow<Signer> + Clone`? Although this might be overkill, all instances of `Signer` I've seen have `Clone` derived anyways",

The problem is w/ `Rc<...>` the traits `Send` nor `Sync` can't be implemented for `Client` nor `Program`, whereas I think for `S: Signer + Send + Sync` they should automatically be implemented",
