although i think my python days are further & further behind me

welcome to the jungle

good idea
That's fine. Just skip the state tests.
misc is unfortunate because it uses `state` and I skipped implementing that
That''s a good 80/20 I think.
Probably don't neeed all of them. I'd start with tutorials + `misc`.
grinding through translating the Anchor tests üòÖ
Oh lit


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

thanks!
think I figured it out
yes
the default one just uses localnet
oh yeah in that case you do need to pass a different Provider
no
are you using a `solana-test-validator`?
weird
oh
`httpcore.ConnectError: All connection attempts failed`
my connections are failing for some reason
the `__init__` method of `Program` has a `provider` param. Is there something in particular you're trying to achieve by passing a different Provider?
btw how do I pass RPC provider to program?
did a pull from git
I was using the latest I think
also I pushed a new version with a bugfix three hours ago, so please use that if not already
yeah this seems like the right behaviour, except maybe it could be clearer when it's ok to use `create_workspace`
yes fixed
Just guessing üòÅ
Haven't deployed it so metadata.address is not populated maybe?
NFT for the first anchor-py support question imo
is something wrong with my idl?
```.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/anchorpy/workspace.py", line 32, in create_workspace
    program = Program(idl, PublicKey(metadata.address), Provider.local(url))
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'address'```

i'm not sure what voting does
you are all welcome to vote for AnchorPy at the hackathon https://devpost.com/software/anchorpy


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

that way you really have to mean it
votes should be sent as ethereum transactions
if you bot yourself enough you get $10k and a shoutout by  everyone in the solana team
lets goo
anchor py


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

got the tests working in CI  üêç üêç üêç  now to add more tests


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

ok thanks
currently 3.9 and up
Great üëç
some take longer to add because they need code from other Solana libraries
the shortest answer is all the tests that you can see here https://github.com/kevinheavey/anchorpy/actions/runs/1378799746
but I'm adding more
Which python versions is anchorpy available to?
Im looking into lockup
Which tests can I currently run with anchorpy?


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

google just doesn't think the AnchorPy GitHub repo exists at all ü§î  it can pull up the docs but not the repo


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I'm about to release 0.3.0 with support for the `at` constructor like anchor-ts has. But based on your example you're just looking to set the RPC url in code, then you want something like:

```
from anchorpy import Program, Provider
provider = Provider.local('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com')
program = Program(idl, program_id, provider)

```
that was very polite of you to direct the question at a hypothetical "anyone"
anyone have some nice anchorpy examples? for reading accounts on mainnet? i've been doing this

```# use mainnet
os.environ['ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL'] = 'https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com'
```
